Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:14.949
English, the show where you can improve your English while learning fascinating things about the

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:15.399
world.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.259
Today we are talking about the chicken.

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:27.129
The bird that, from its humble South Asian roots, has conquered the world, at least in population

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.669
terms, outnumbering humans by three to one.

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:37.704
Before we get right into it, let me just remind that those of you listening to this on Spotify,

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:44.094
Google Podcasts, iVoox or wherever you may choose to get your podcasts, that you can get a copy of

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:49.314
the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast over on the website, which is

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:50.684
leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:58.449
The transcript comes in PDF format for you to download, it's there on the website too, but also it

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.029
now comes in animating format.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:08.049
So this is a bit like subtitles, but actually way cooler because you can tap on the word and your

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.819
browser should give you the definition.

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:16.179
And the key vocabulary is really useful because the less common words are explained.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.999
You don't have to stop to look things up in a dictionary, and it means that you can also build up

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.279
your vocabulary while listening to the podcast.

00:01:25.164 --> 00:01:26.514
So go and check that out.

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:28.594
It's at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:32.314
Okay, so chickens.

00:01:33.064 --> 00:01:36.754
Now, I obviously don't need to tell you what a chicken is.

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:45.034
It's the most common bird in the world, and there are about 23 billion chickens on the planet right

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:50.494
now, and this year, 65 billion chickens will be consumed.

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:54.034
That is obviously a huge amount.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.679
But let's just put it in perspective.

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:05.079
That means that 180 million chickens are eaten every day, seven and a half million every hour,

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:11.559
125,000 every minute and 2000 every second.

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.119
Whatever your views are on eating chicken, that is evidently a huge amount of chicken.

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:28.629
And today we are going to tell the story of how one slightly obscure bird from South Asia went from

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:36.609
wandering around the forest floor looking for insects to being shoveled down people's throats at a

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.099
rate of two every millisecond.

00:02:41.423 --> 00:02:47.993
It's a pretty interesting story, and you could also look at it as a classic example of the

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:55.403
industrialisation of production, of how humans have shaped the world we live in to meet our needs

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:59.873
rather than adapt our needs to what exists in the natural world.

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:06.966
So there is a little bit of debate about where the chicken actually came from.

00:03:07.836 --> 00:03:16.041
Charles Darwin, the famous biologist and author of On The Origin of Species, he asserted, he was

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:24.831
sure that all modern chicken had a shared ancestor, the red jungle fowl, Gallus Gallus, which lived

00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:29.271
in Southeast Asia between Northern India and the Philippines.

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:38.961
This bird, presumably, had a very nice day-to-day life foraging, looking for food, on the jungle

00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:44.721
floor during the day, and then flying up to the trees for the evening to avoid being eaten by

00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:45.291
predators.

00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:54.711
Much like how we imagine a chicken now, it was pretty bad at flying, so getting up to the low

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:58.971
branches of a tree was just about all it could manage.

00:04:01.161 --> 00:04:09.141
There's still some debate between archeologists and geneticists about what other birds the Gallus

00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:14.766
Gallus bred with, but it's thought it was probably a similar bird from Southern India.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:21.606
Anyway, the rise of the chicken started almost 4,000 years ago.

00:04:22.536 --> 00:04:29.946
Remains of chicken have been discovered in the Indus Valley in modern day Pakistan, and from there

00:04:30.156 --> 00:04:35.226
it traveled up to Egypt, or rather it was transported by merchants to Egypt.

00:04:36.621 --> 00:04:42.051
And do you can imagine why it traveled so easily, why it was so easy to transport.

00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:48.501
Obviously chickens can't really fly, so you don't have to worry about them escaping.

00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:55.551
They are pretty adaptable to new temperatures, both hot and cold, so you don't need to constantly

00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:58.371
worry about them getting too hot or too cold.

00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:02.061
They're easy to take on a boat or on a cart.

00:05:03.201 --> 00:05:06.021
They're easy to feed, you just need some grain.

00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:10.551
They lay eggs, so they are a constant source of food.

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:15.741
And if you're extra hungry, well, they're pretty easy to cook as well.

00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:24.621
So you could say that the chicken's fate as a bird that was destined to travel the world was sealed

00:05:24.621 --> 00:05:25.611
by its biology.

00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:31.976
And different civilisations welcomed the chicken in different ways.

00:05:33.356 --> 00:05:37.886
The Egyptians became masters of artificial incubation.

00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:47.646
They figured out, they found a way, to create the exact conditions that an egg needs to hatch, and

00:05:47.676 --> 00:05:56.196
they created huge egg ovens, which could hatch four and a half thousand eggs in two to three weeks.

00:05:57.876 --> 00:06:04.596
The advantage of this was, of course, that it means that the hens didn't need to sit on their eggs

00:06:05.136 --> 00:06:08.166
and they could get back to the task of laying more eggs.

00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:15.336
From Egypt the chicken continued to spread throughout the Mediterranean and it soon became a

00:06:15.336 --> 00:06:23.466
delicacy for the Romans, who were probably the first civilisation to try to industrialise the

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:30.426
production of chicken, keeping them in large farms and doing everything they could possibly do to

00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:33.126
fatten up the birds, to make them fatter.

00:06:34.226 --> 00:06:41.546
It said that Roman techniques for fattening up the chickens included giving the chickens wheat

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:47.966
soaked in wine or even feeding them lizard fat, so the fat from lizards.

00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:54.746
After the fall of Rome, the chicken fell out of favour a little bit.

00:06:55.826 --> 00:07:04.376
As you know, it's not a particularly tough bird, and given that they no longer lived in this life of

00:07:04.376 --> 00:07:09.236
luxury in Roman farms, they didn't grow as quickly or as large.

00:07:09.836 --> 00:07:17.276
And in the medieval times, people tended to prefer birds that were a little bit tougher, things like

00:07:17.726 --> 00:07:19.196
guinea fowl or geese.

00:07:21.026 --> 00:07:23.786
So when did things change for the chicken?

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:32.006
If people in the medieval era had mostly lost interest in this bird, when did things change?

00:07:33.476 --> 00:07:39.536
Well, and I guess you could debate whether this was a positive or negative change for the fate of

00:07:39.536 --> 00:07:47.726
the chicken, things all changed when people realised that they could add antibiotics and vitamins to

00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:53.216
the food that was given to chicken, and this would mean that chickens could be raised indoors.

00:07:55.176 --> 00:08:03.306
Like any animal, chickens need certain vitamins to develop, to grow, and to process vitamin D, they

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:04.146
need sunlight.

00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:06.156
They need to be outside.

00:08:08.136 --> 00:08:14.706
Chickens, naturally, in their natural habitat would spend their days wandering around looking for

00:08:14.706 --> 00:08:17.856
bits of food, not eating particularly fast.

00:08:18.996 --> 00:08:22.326
And of course, this would mean that they wouldn't grow very quickly.

00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:26.771
Or rather they would just grow at their normal rates.

00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:36.281
But keeping chickens inside and giving them vitamins and antibiotics now meant that they didn't need

00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:38.381
to do anything other than eat.

00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:47.411
They could be kept in these huge farms, in very confined spaces and focus their attentions on the

00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:51.491
business of eating, the business of growing to be slaughtered.

00:08:53.516 --> 00:09:01.286
What this meant was that the price of chicken for consumers was greatly reduced, meaning that

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:06.746
consumption levels, the levels at which chicken was eaten increased dramatically.

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:15.746
And whatever you might think of the actual business of chicken farming, and putting aside any kind

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:22.916
of moral questions for one minute, it is now an incredibly efficient way if turning grain into

00:09:22.976 --> 00:09:23.456
protein.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:32.546
It takes less than two kilos of chicken feed, of chicken grain, to produce one kilo of chicken.

00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:41.726
And if we compare that to other animals, for pork it takes three kilos to produce one kilo of pork.

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:46.346
And for beef it takes seven kilos to produce one kilo.

00:09:47.366 --> 00:09:54.716
So the chicken industry is now incredibly efficient and the price of chicken is reflective of that.

00:09:55.886 --> 00:10:00.326
Almost anywhere in the world chicken is one of the cheapest meats available.

00:10:02.546 --> 00:10:10.076
And its affordability has meant that it is ubiquitous, it's everywhere, and it forms a part of

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.236
almost every cuisine in the world.

00:10:13.466 --> 00:10:22.166
From a French chicken chasseur, to Chinese gong bao chicken to Caribbean jerk chicken, to the famous

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:28.886
British roast chicken, to chicken katsu curry, there aren't many countries that don't use any

00:10:28.886 --> 00:10:29.346
chicken.

00:10:31.316 --> 00:10:38.486
And aside from the price, the fact that chicken is so easy to raise, to grow, is a big reason for

00:10:38.486 --> 00:10:38.786
this.

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:48.281
But also the fact that chicken is a relatively bland, a relatively plain meat, means that cooks are

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:51.371
free to add their own spices and sauces to it.

00:10:51.911 --> 00:10:56.201
So it can easily take on almost whatever taste the cook decides.

00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:04.841
Indeed, the sheer scale of how much chicken is eaten is testament to just how popular it is.

00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:14.926
If this podcast has been going on for 10 minutes now we're coming up to 1.5 million chickens having

00:11:14.926 --> 00:11:17.086
been eaten just while you've been listening.

00:11:19.246 --> 00:11:25.036
It's the sort of thing that, if human life on earth were to be wiped out tomorrow, and all

00:11:25.036 --> 00:11:32.506
historical records erased, if a new generation of archeologists arrived in a thousand years, I'm

00:11:32.506 --> 00:11:38.861
sure they would be quite puzzled by how much chicken was eaten by people all over the world.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:47.921
For the ancestor of the chicken, the Gallus Gallus, the red jungle fowl, life in the jungle

00:11:47.951 --> 00:11:48.581
continues.

00:11:49.421 --> 00:11:56.801
It is free to forage, to wander around the jungle, looking for little bits of food and to retreat up

00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:00.521
to the trees when night draws in, when night comes.

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:10.602
But, and this is a somewhat cruel twist of fate, the population of red jungle fowl is decreasing as

00:12:10.602 --> 00:12:19.932
its habitat is gradually eroded in part due to people making way for large farms for what we now

00:12:19.992 --> 00:12:21.522
know as the chicken.

00:12:23.932 --> 00:12:28.102
As one passing thought, my parents kept chickens for awhile.

00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:34.002
We had four, I think it was, and they just had a little patch in the garden.

00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:41.652
They are actually really sweet animals, they're really friendly and would always want to come and

00:12:41.652 --> 00:12:44.322
see what you were doing, to be near you.

00:12:45.882 --> 00:12:51.522
And they always seem to be curious about what was going on, which of course I liked a lot.

00:12:53.392 --> 00:12:59.452
And one final point, the idea for this podcast actually came as I was walking along the street with

00:12:59.452 --> 00:13:00.922
my wife and we saw a chicken.

00:13:01.762 --> 00:13:08.412
I pointed at it and said, 'they're from the jungle, did you know that?' She didn't, but she said it

00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:10.872
would make an interesting idea for a podcast.

00:13:12.222 --> 00:13:13.332
So there you go.

00:13:13.452 --> 00:13:19.572
Chickens are from the jungle, although they've come a long way, for better or for worse, from their

00:13:19.572 --> 00:13:19.962
roots.

00:13:22.077 --> 00:13:26.907
As usual, if you are looking for their transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast, you can get

00:13:26.907 --> 00:13:30.177
that on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:13:30.657 --> 00:13:37.257
As I said at the start of the podcast, the transcript is available in new animating form, so a bit

00:13:37.257 --> 00:13:38.717
like subtitles, but even better.

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:42.517
So do go and check that out, that's at leonardoenglish.com.

00:13:43.737 --> 00:13:48.582
I'm Alastair Budge and you've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:13:48.582 --> 00:13:48.987
English.

00:13:49.422 --> 00:13:51.912
I'll catch you in the next episode.

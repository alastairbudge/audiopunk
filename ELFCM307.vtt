Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:17.441
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:21.691
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:26.701
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it is part two of our three-part

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:30.579
mini-series on The Murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.629
In case you haven’t listened to part one yet, now is the time to press pause and listen to that, as

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:41.890
it does have a lot of important information and background to what we will be talking about today.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.070
In today’s episode, part two, we will look at how the investigation progressed,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.780
how the police worked, or rather didn’t work, to find Daphne’s killers, and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.620
how the investigation went right up to the heart of Maltese political power.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.830
And in part three, the final part, we’ll look at the trial of Daphne’s

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.050
alleged killers, and ask ourselves whether the truth will ever be revealed.

00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:14.501
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:22.131
In part one of this mini-series we learned about Daphne Caruana Galizia and

00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:26.671
her fight against institutionalised corruption on the small island of Malta.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:32.281
We heard how political and private interests were deeply interlinked,

00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:38.391
how Malta became awash with money of perhaps dubious origins, and learned

00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:42.031
about some of the cases of corruption that Daphne had highlighted.

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:49.821
And, of course, you know how this story ends, or at least how it ended for Daphne, with

00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:55.291
her brutal assassination in a rental car outside her house in the Maltese countryside.

00:01:56.261 --> 00:02:02.261
That was on October 16th of 2017, so, what happened next?

00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:07.941
As you might expect, the aftermath was full of tough statements

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:11.311
and promises from the Maltese police and politicians.

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:18.001
The Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, called her murder a “barbaric attack on

00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:23.021
freedom of expression that goes against every sense of decency and civility”.

00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:28.801
He said that everything will be done to find Daphne’s killers, and announced

00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:33.481
a 1 million Euro reward for information that would lead to their capture.

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:36.391
So, what happened?

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:40.831
Surely it couldn’t be that hard to find some information.

00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:47.541
Malta is, after all, a tiny island, which makes it hard to escape, and although

00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:52.811
Daphne’s house was in what is in Malta called “the countryside”, it’s only a few

00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:58.181
hundred metres away from a major road and a kilometre from one of Malta’s largest towns.

00:02:59.031 --> 00:03:01.221
Someone had to have seen something…

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:04.301
But, surprise surprise, nothing.

00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:09.731
Crickets, as the American expression goes, meaning that there was complete silence.

00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:16.381
The days and weeks passed and there were no real leads, no developments

00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:19.761
in the investigation, or at least nothing that was made public.

00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:25.821
One group that certainly wasn’t buying this, that didn’t believe that

00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:31.761
this could be true, was Daphne’s three sons, Matthew, Andrew and Paul.

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:37.801
They gave extensive interviews to the foreign press insinuating, suggesting,

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:43.231
that the investigation was being prevented by powerful forces within the Maltese

00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:48.921
elite, by politicians, policemen, businessmen, or a combination of all three.

00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:54.391
It would later transpire that they had every reason to be suspicious,

00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:58.081
to be sceptical of what they were being told by the police.

00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:04.141
And despite the fact that this was a crime against a Maltese person, in

00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:09.121
Malta, most likely carried out by a Maltese person on the orders of another

00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:14.201
Maltese person, the news of Daphne’s murder quickly spread around the globe.

00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:19.791
Malta was in the European Union, she was the most famous journalist in the

00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:24.171
country, it was an attack on the very heart of the freedom of the press.

00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:30.121
And the fact that she had accused so many powerful people of corruption,

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:34.191
and then there were no developments in her own murder investigation

00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:38.851
suggested foul play, it suggested that someone was covering it up.

00:04:39.861 --> 00:04:45.261
It wouldn’t be until December, two months later, that the first developments were made.

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:50.391
The police raided a warehouse in the industrial area of

00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:54.011
Marsa, just southwest of Valletta, the island’s capital.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:05:03.196
In a disused potato shed they found three men: two brothers, Alfred and George DeGiorgio,

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:09.821
and another man, Vince Muscat, who I should add is not a relation of the Prime Minister,

00:05:10.161 --> 00:05:17.371
Joseph Muscat - Muscat is a very common Maltese surname, it’s like Smith or Jones in the UK.

00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:22.571
All three of these men, the DeGiorgio brothers and Vince

00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:26.561
Muscat, were hardened criminals, well-known to the police.

00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:32.731
They were hitmen, essentially, contract killers, people who lived a life of crime.

00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:37.021
They weren’t politicians in the slightest, they couldn’t have been further

00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:41.821
from the Maltese political class, they were fixers and mercenaries.

00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:50.031
But, it would later transpire, these three men in the potato shed knew exactly when the

00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:56.251
police were coming, they had been tipped off, yet they were willing to stay and be arrested.

00:05:57.421 --> 00:05:59.731
The only question would be, why?

00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:06.041
Well, perhaps the simple answer is that the evidence linking them to the crime was strong.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:11.671
DNA from cigarette butts left at the murder scene, as well

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:15.581
as data from mobile phone towers was pretty conclusive.

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:21.061
These men might have been professional killers, but they weren’t very professional.

00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:28.371
The more cynical, sceptical, or realistic answer, perhaps, was that international

00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:33.501
pressure was building and the Maltese state needed to hold someone accountable

00:06:33.511 --> 00:06:37.591
for the crimes, they needed to show the international community that they

00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:41.751
were capable of finding who had killed the country’s most famous journalist.

00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:48.961
But did anyone believe that these three lifelong but relatively amateur criminals

00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:54.411
had been the ones who wanted Daphne dead, and who masterminded the entire operation?

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:55.901
No.

00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.981
Indeed, George DeGiorgio, one of the gang, would later testify in an interview

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.055
that he didn’t really know who Daphne was, it was just business, and that if

00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:11.470
he had known how famous Daphne was he would have asked for much more money.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.720
He must have been one of the few people in the country who didn’t

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.020
know who she was, but this gives you an idea of how far away, at least

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.230
socially and culturally, he was from the Maltese political elite.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:32.171
So, the police made these arrests, they had tracked down the people who they believe had

00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:37.681
planted and detonated the bomb, but were they any closer to those who ordered the hit?

00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:40.941
They were not, at least publicly.

00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:46.231
The investigation continued, with many people, including Daphne’s

00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:50.241
family, questioning whether much was actually happening at all.

00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:54.271
There were no public developments, no announcements

00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:57.291
about any new leads or anyone else being arrested.

00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:03.611
This was the case for practically two years, which, clearly, for the people who had

00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:09.351
ordered the murder, gave them plenty of time to get their story straight, to agree on their

00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:14.951
account of what happened, and to get rid of any evidence that would tie them to the crime.

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:21.081
Then in November of 2019, everything changed.

00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:26.331
First, on November 20th, the owner of one of Malta’s

00:08:26.341 --> 00:08:29.801
largest and richest business groups was arrested.

00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:36.711
The man’s name was Yorgen Fenech, and he owned and operated a wide

00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:40.971
variety of casinos, hotels and other businesses on the island.

00:08:42.403 --> 00:08:45.754
Mysteriously, he was also involved with the development

00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:48.714
of a new power plant that was to be built on the island.

00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:54.424
Like the three men in the potato shed, he too had been tipped

00:08:54.424 --> 00:08:57.864
off, he had been alerted that he was going to be arrested.

00:08:58.904 --> 00:09:02.324
He had tried to flee the island early in the morning on his

00:09:02.374 --> 00:09:05.834
luxury yacht, but he had been caught before he could get away.

00:09:07.044 --> 00:09:10.784
I should say that he said he wasn’t trying to escape, he would

00:09:10.784 --> 00:09:14.904
claim that he was simply going on a scheduled boat visit to Sicily.

00:09:16.024 --> 00:09:19.844
But this supposedly “scheduled visit” meant leaving

00:09:19.954 --> 00:09:23.514
under the cover of darkness, he was arrested at 5:30am.

00:09:24.354 --> 00:09:30.124
And it would also later transpire that he had tried to hire a private jet from the

00:09:30.124 --> 00:09:35.084
airport the night before, he had made arrangements to pay for a villa in the south

00:09:35.084 --> 00:09:41.064
of France in cash, and that he had tried to buy cyanide and a gun off the Dark Web.

00:09:41.844 --> 00:09:45.814
Oh, and he also had 21 SIM cards with him on the boat.

00:09:46.764 --> 00:09:51.334
You can decide for yourself whether you think this sounds like a “scheduled boat visit”.

00:09:52.254 --> 00:09:55.784
In any case, we’ll hear plenty more about Yorgen Fenech later.

00:09:57.134 --> 00:10:01.584
Then, a week later, on November 26th, it was one of

00:10:01.584 --> 00:10:04.644
the most monumental days of the investigation to date.

00:10:05.994 --> 00:10:11.834
And this is where it gets personal again, or at least I can share my personal experience.

00:10:12.584 --> 00:10:16.364
I was working in an office about a kilometre away from my apartment.

00:10:17.144 --> 00:10:23.214
I got a message from my wife, who was at the time at home with our then one month-old son.

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:26.694
All the power in the area had gone out.

00:10:27.304 --> 00:10:31.924
She wasn’t able to use the lift to take our infant son outside in his pram.

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:36.434
I got messages from other friends in other areas of the island.

00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:41.404
Their power had gone too, and before long my office,

00:10:41.444 --> 00:10:45.034
and the entire island, was plunged into darkness.

00:10:46.024 --> 00:10:52.024
Now, this rarely ever happens in Malta on such a large scale, and it was quite the

00:10:52.024 --> 00:10:57.044
coincidence that it happened, that the power to the entire country was cut off, on

00:10:57.044 --> 00:11:01.544
the day that investigations were closing in on the Prime Minister’s inner circle.

00:11:02.344 --> 00:11:07.674
Or perhaps it was simply a pathetic fallacy, a foreshadowing of what was to come.

00:11:08.714 --> 00:11:14.714
See, earlier that day Keith Schembri, who you may remember from episode 1 as

00:11:14.714 --> 00:11:19.254
being the Prime Minister’s Chief of Staff and having a wide range of business

00:11:19.274 --> 00:11:23.844
interests in the country, he was arrested and taken in for questioning.

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:31.624
It seems that he too was tipped off, alerted, that the police were coming, because when

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:36.984
they arrived and asked him for his phone, he told them that he had recently lost it.

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:44.114
Recently, it would later transpire, would mean that he lost it 30 minutes before

00:11:44.114 --> 00:11:48.364
the police arrived, when it was permanently switched off at his family home.

00:11:49.674 --> 00:11:54.806
This, by the way, was at 5am, which does seem like an unusual time

00:11:54.806 --> 00:11:58.486
to switch off your phone at home and never be able to find it again.

00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:01.796
Why was Keith Schembri arrested?

00:12:02.186 --> 00:12:07.946
Well, Yorgen Fenech, the businessman with casinos and hotels, had told police

00:12:08.096 --> 00:12:12.826
that he had information about Daphne’s murder that implicated not just Keith

00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:18.656
Schembri, but also the former Energy and Health Minister Konrad Mizzi, the Minister

00:12:18.656 --> 00:12:22.956
for the Economy Chris Cardona and other people “close to the prime minister.”

00:12:24.496 --> 00:12:29.743
Fenech was willing to testify in court and reveal all about those at the

00:12:29.743 --> 00:12:33.626
top of the Maltese political system who had been involved with the killing

00:12:34.006 --> 00:12:39.686
but, in exchange, he wanted a Presidential pardon, he wanted to avoid jail.

00:12:41.056 --> 00:12:46.306
As you may know, this is a pretty common thing in many judicial systems.

00:12:46.676 --> 00:12:51.286
In exchange for providing valuable information, someone can be given a

00:12:51.286 --> 00:12:56.266
reduced criminal sentence or even pardoned, not given any punishment at all.

00:12:57.496 --> 00:13:00.826
The decision on whether to give Fenech this Presidential

00:13:00.836 --> 00:13:05.127
pardon needed to be taken by the Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat.

00:13:06.486 --> 00:13:10.626
Would he do it, and pardon Fenech in exchange for the information

00:13:10.686 --> 00:13:15.076
he claimed to have on the most powerful people in Maltese politics?

00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:20.986
Well, Muscat was clearly too close to the case, Fenech was

00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:25.166
promising damning information about Muscat’s closest allies.

00:13:26.186 --> 00:13:32.726
So, Muscat, the Prime Minister, recused himself, he withdrew himself from the decision, he said

00:13:32.726 --> 00:13:38.816
he was too personally involved, so he left the decision-making process to his cabinet ministers.

00:13:40.256 --> 00:13:45.436
There were extensive deliberations, long discussions, which went well into the night.

00:13:46.486 --> 00:13:52.416
Outside, angry crowds were gathering, shouting “mafia” and calling for justice.

00:13:53.376 --> 00:13:57.016
The verdict, the decision that the Maltese cabinet came to?

00:13:57.856 --> 00:14:02.346
They were not going to agree to a pardon, essentially they didn’t want to

00:14:02.346 --> 00:14:06.896
listen to what Fenech had to say and were not going to give him a pardon.

00:14:08.096 --> 00:14:11.666
The public was furious, the protests grew angrier.

00:14:12.176 --> 00:14:17.226
People called for the Prime Minister to go, to resign, saying that he

00:14:17.226 --> 00:14:22.536
had allowed a culture of impunity to flourish, for his closest allies

00:14:22.536 --> 00:14:26.426
and friends to do whatever they wanted without fear of punishment.

00:14:27.626 --> 00:14:33.786
And then the bombshell, the huge allegation, that his right hand man Keith Schembri,

00:14:34.236 --> 00:14:39.556
someone who had said that the Prime Minister and he were “best friends”, that he was

00:14:39.556 --> 00:14:44.896
responsible for the murder of the country’s most famous and most controversial journalist.

00:14:45.616 --> 00:14:47.356
It was too much.

00:14:47.946 --> 00:14:56.916
On Sunday, December 1st of 2019, 776 days after Daphne Caruana Galizia was murdered, Joseph

00:14:56.916 --> 00:15:02.846
Muscat, the Prime Minister of Malta, announced that he would step down, that he would resign.

00:15:03.946 --> 00:15:09.526
In his farewell address, his farewell speech, he mentioned his own shortcomings and

00:15:09.726 --> 00:15:15.816
failures, but painted himself as a victim, essentially saying that it wasn’t his fault.

00:15:16.906 --> 00:15:23.686
He said “there is a need for a clear signal of a fresh page”, that the country needed change.

00:15:24.876 --> 00:15:30.726
That change would come in the form of a man called Robert Abela, the son of the former

00:15:30.726 --> 00:15:36.446
President, and a man who, it would turn out, wasn’t really that much of a change at all.

00:15:37.696 --> 00:15:43.216
So, by the start of 2020, the Maltese police would publicly claim that they had

00:15:43.216 --> 00:15:48.336
found the mastermind, in the form of Yorgen Fenech, that they had found the men who

00:15:48.346 --> 00:15:53.776
arranged, planted and detonated the bomb, in the form of Vince Muscat and the DeGiorgio

00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:58.774
brothers and the country had a new Prime Minister, in the form of Robert Abela.

00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:03.876
All that was needed would be to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and the

00:16:03.876 --> 00:16:09.746
case could be closed, this dark episode of Maltese history consigned to the past.

00:16:10.846 --> 00:16:16.946
Except, as the subsequent investigations would show, it was only getting started…

00:16:19.425 --> 00:16:25.015
OK then, that is it for part two of this mini-series on Daphne Caruana Galizia.

00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:29.815
Next up we will look at what has happened since then, where we’ll meet a

00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:34.655
crooked taxi driver, allegations against the Minister of the Economy, even

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:39.205
more egregious allegations of corruption, including police corruption and

00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:43.985
we’ll ask ourselves whether Daphne’s killers will ever be brought to justice.

00:16:44.855 --> 00:16:48.105
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

Have there been any similar political scandals where you live?

00:16:56.185 --> 00:16:59.985
Who do you think was guilty of the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia?

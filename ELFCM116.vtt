Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.819
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:21.579
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.449
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Jeremy Bentham

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.266
and the philosophical theory for which he is most famous, Utilitarianism.

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:40.287
It’s the idea that we should maximise happiness and minimise pain, and it provides a

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:45.847
framework for thinking about how society should be structured, and how we should behave.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:52.047
We’ll talk about how Bentham developed these theories, what the principles

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:58.607
and key ideas of utilitarianism are, how Bentham used this to reform the

00:00:58.617 --> 00:01:03.727
law, and we’ll finish by revealing what happened to his body when he died.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:10.807
Bentham is a really interesting character, and utilitarianism is a super interesting

00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:16.277
topic that has had a huge impact on the way in which Western societies have developed.

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:19.927
So, I hope you’ll enjoy this episode.

00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:26.247
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can follow along to

00:01:26.247 --> 00:01:31.567

So, if that’s of interest, either for yourself or for

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:11.087
someone else, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:17.851
Ok then, let’s get started and talk about Jeremy Bentham and utilitarianism.

00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:27.641
Jeremy Bentham was born in London on the 15 February 1748, to a wealthy family.

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:35.701
He was reportedly a child prodigy, an extremely gifted child, and was once

00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:41.251
found sitting at his father's desk reading a multi-volume history of England.

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:46.131
He even started to study Latin when he was three.

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:54.811
He was sent to study law at Oxford university when he was only 12 years old, graduating as an

00:02:54.891 --> 00:03:02.811
undergraduate when he was 15, and getting his postgraduate degree when he was 18 years old, in 1766.

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:09.151
He was destined to become a lawyer, but he had no interest in practising

00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:15.661
law, instead preferring to work on ways to improve it, and developing

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:21.561
new frameworks to think about how rules and decisions should be made.

00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:28.861
This was towards the end of the Enlightenment, when pre-existing beliefs

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:34.181
of morals, philosophy, and ethics had been brought into question.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:39.941
Bentham had been very influenced by Enlightenment thinkers such as

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:45.311
Diderot and Voltaire, and he built on Enlightenment ideas about the

00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:50.861
moral role of government, what government was actually meant to do.

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:57.751
In 1789, the same year as the French Revolution, he published his most

00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:03.911
important work, called Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation.

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:12.381
This laid out his views on philosophy, and introduced the greatest happiness principle.

00:04:13.641 --> 00:04:20.791
Bentham proposed that every decision should be evaluated, it should be judged, based

00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:28.191
on the pleasure and pain that result from it, and that a society should seek to take

00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:35.471
decisions that are likely to cause the greatest happiness for the most amount of people.

00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:42.831
Now, this might not sound like a revolutionary idea, but it was novel at the time.

00:04:44.191 --> 00:04:50.241
Bentham proposed a new framework for thinking about every decision that we take.

00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:58.601
Instead of relying on old, inherent principles of right and wrong, or

00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:04.421
laws that might have existed for hundreds of years, Bentham proposed

00:05:04.461 --> 00:05:10.651
an empirical, scientific system for evaluating everything that we do.

00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:16.041
A way that you could actually measure, that you could quantify.

00:05:17.361 --> 00:05:21.101
By pleasure, he didn’t just mean pleasure in terms

00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.831
of physical pleasure; it was also spiritual pleasure.

00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:31.561
And the same for pain, it wasn’t just physical pain, but also spiritual pain.

00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:39.251
And he defined six different ways in which you could measure pleasure and pain

00:05:40.671 --> 00:05:47.131
The first was its intensity, how intense and powerful it was.

00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:50.581
Secondly its duration, how long it lasted.

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:58.751
Thirdly, its certainty, how certain was the act to cause pain or pleasure.

00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:05.661
Fourth, its proximity, so, how close the pain or pleasure will be

00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:10.751
to the action - will it happen immediately or will it take 10 years?

00:06:11.351 --> 00:06:17.788
Fifth, its productiveness, so how likely is it to lead to more pleasure or pain?

00:06:18.768 --> 00:06:25.578
And finally its purity, so is it just pleasure, or does it also involve some pain?

00:06:26.918 --> 00:06:33.838
Bentham proposed that any action could and should be evaluated based on

00:06:33.838 --> 00:06:39.968
these six categories, and that this should be a framework for taking any

00:06:39.968 --> 00:06:46.588
decision, and also a framework with which rules and laws should be made.

00:06:47.978 --> 00:06:55.568
Bentham rejected the existing laws because they were not based on calculations and empirical data.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:07:00.798
There was no ‘reason’ for them, and just because they had always been like

00:07:00.798 --> 00:07:05.988
that, that didn’t make them right, it didn't make them morally correct.

00:07:07.158 --> 00:07:13.098
In many cases, he believed that the laws actually did more harm than good.

00:07:14.318 --> 00:07:18.208
One of his first examples of this was to do with the

00:07:18.218 --> 00:07:22.058
punishment of criminals, and how criminals were treated.

00:07:22.928 --> 00:07:29.268
Now, if you have listened to the episodes on things like the British empire, or

00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:35.398
the gin craze, you’ll know that the justice system in Britain was pretty harsh.

00:07:36.158 --> 00:07:41.698
You could be executed or thrown into prison for crimes that we would now

00:07:41.718 --> 00:07:47.848
consider to be very minor, which had the result of hundreds of thousands

00:07:47.848 --> 00:07:52.928
of people being killed, put into prison or sent off to the colonies.

00:07:54.358 --> 00:08:00.348
Bentham used his new ethical framework to propose that the justice

00:08:00.358 --> 00:08:06.168
system was harmful, it was actually causing more pain than pleasure.

00:08:07.098 --> 00:08:13.938
The pain that these criminals had to endure was not only unnecessary in most cases,

00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:20.298
but it didn’t result in pleasure for society, or the reformation of these criminals.

00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:28.658
So he proposed some radical ideas about what could be done about the wider justice system.

00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:34.838
But what he started off with was actually an idea about

00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:39.018
a new type of prison, something called a Panopticon.

00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:46.668
This idea involved a circular prison, with a room with guards in the centre.

00:08:47.598 --> 00:08:52.368
From there the guards could look out and observe all the prisoners,

00:08:52.738 --> 00:08:57.278
leading to a reduction in the number of guards that were actually required.

00:08:57.938 --> 00:09:03.218
This would lead to more efficient, less expensive prisons that

00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:07.938
actually did a better job at rehabilitating the prisoners inside.

00:09:08.888 --> 00:09:15.028
So more pleasure, less pain, it ticked all the boxes in the utilitarian framework.

00:09:16.128 --> 00:09:21.558
After some initial interest from the British government, and Bentham ploughing

00:09:21.578 --> 00:09:27.608
in large amounts of his own money, the plan was rejected, leaving Bentham

00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:33.128
bitter about the interests of the ruling class, which he later developed into

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:38.708
a theory of how selfish interests manifest themselves in decision making.

00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:46.498
But this rejection of his architectural idea didn’t stop Bentham from pursuing his more

00:09:46.498 --> 00:09:52.948
radical plans about how the justice system, and the penal code, should be reformed.

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:58.718
Seen through the lens of utilitarianism, a lot of the prevailing

00:09:58.718 --> 00:10:03.158
justice system, the justice system at the time, didn’t make sense.

00:10:04.038 --> 00:10:07.728
Why should someone be killed for stealing?

00:10:08.278 --> 00:10:12.158
This causes a lot of pain to them, and to their family,

00:10:12.538 --> 00:10:16.438
and what pleasure is gained, who actually benefits?

00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:19.298
What good does it actually do?

00:10:20.668 --> 00:10:22.583
This concept of pleasure vs.

00:10:22.748 --> 00:10:24.064
pain wasn’t actually Bentham’s invention.

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:33.028
It can be traced back to the ancient Greeks, and to Epicurean.

00:10:33.028 --> 00:10:37.188
And naturally, ideas of what is right and wrong, and how

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:41.588
to evaluate right and wrong is at the core of philosophy.

00:10:42.488 --> 00:10:47.648
But the ancient philosophers tended to focus on individual

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:51.998
decision making, so how should you or I take a decision?

00:10:53.008 --> 00:11:00.148
Bentham enlarged this to focus on a society as a whole, with his system of

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:06.928
utilitarianism proposing that societies should base their decisions on where

00:11:06.928 --> 00:11:11.718
the most amount of pleasure can be gained at the expense of the least pain.

00:11:12.948 --> 00:11:17.578
So for every decision, what should be done in order for the most

00:11:17.588 --> 00:11:21.878
amount of pleasure to be created for society and the people in it?

00:11:23.758 --> 00:11:28.648
Bentham accepted that this idea in itself had its own share of problems though.

00:11:29.258 --> 00:11:35.548
For example, if a majority in society gains pleasure from something at the

00:11:35.548 --> 00:11:41.848
expense of the extreme suffering of a minority in society, is that acceptable?

00:11:42.858 --> 00:11:49.628
You could point at things like gladiators in ancient Rome and say, well, the audience gain

00:11:49.648 --> 00:11:56.008
pleasure from seeing people killing each other and being eaten by wild animals, and there

00:11:56.008 --> 00:12:02.078
are thousands of people in the audience and only a handful of people who are savagely killed.

00:12:03.318 --> 00:12:10.468
And indeed this was one of the greatest criticisms of utilitarianism, and certainly is

00:12:10.488 --> 00:12:16.248
still a problem today - countries and societies don’t agree on the best way to solve it.

00:12:17.178 --> 00:12:22.888
Just look at almost any democratic election around the world today and there

00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:28.528
will be a plethora of different viewpoints about what the trade-offs should

00:12:28.528 --> 00:12:34.608
be between helping the least fortunate in society vs helping the majority.

00:12:35.718 --> 00:12:40.908
The pro-utilitarianism point of view is that at least Bentham, and

00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:46.938
utilitarianism propose an empirical framework to think about it, a way

00:12:47.138 --> 00:12:51.918
that you can actually measure to evaluate what the best decision is.

00:12:53.103 --> 00:13:01.293
Of course, taking decisions purely from a utilitarian point of view allows for a society to become

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:08.863
very unequal, assuming that those experiencing the pain, or having the least, are in the minority.

00:13:10.443 --> 00:13:17.253
Bentham continued to hone his theory, to adapt it for these sorts of scenarios and prepare

00:13:17.253 --> 00:13:24.213
it for these questions, but the basic theory of utilitarianism remained that decisions should

00:13:24.223 --> 00:13:30.083
be taken based on the total happiness of its people, the total pleasure minus total pain.

00:13:30.083 --> 00:13:36.953
Another issue, or critique, that is often raised about utilitarianism

00:13:37.253 --> 00:13:41.943
is that it doesn’t provide a definition of what happiness is.

00:13:42.853 --> 00:13:49.348
This is evidently a question that has troubled, and continues to trouble, philosophers throughout

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:57.268
history, but Bentham’s utilitarian framework wasn’t trying to provide the meaning of happiness.

00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:02.298
Instead, he was providing a framework for how we should think about

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:07.878
decision-making, how societies should be structured in order to make sure that

00:14:07.888 --> 00:14:13.278
the most happiness can be experienced, whatever happiness actually may be.

00:14:14.138 --> 00:14:20.718
And although he started with the world of criminal justice, he didn’t stop there, he expanded his

00:14:20.728 --> 00:14:27.808
theories to evaluate the laws around everything from economics to sexuality and animal rights.

00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:32.788
In terms of economics, England had been experiencing rising

00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:37.888
food prices and life for the poor in the country was dreadful.

00:14:39.088 --> 00:14:43.328
Bentham proposed changes to monetary policy that would help the poor,

00:14:43.728 --> 00:14:48.658
such as pumping money into the financial system to pay for things like

00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:54.258
poor houses, which were large houses for poor  people to live and work in.

00:14:55.248 --> 00:15:02.888
In terms of sexuality, he used this framework to propose the reform of laws around homosexuality.

00:15:03.928 --> 00:15:11.098
Using the greatest happiness principle, Bentham suggested that homosexual acts resulted in pleasure

00:15:11.118 --> 00:15:17.368
for people who felt the desire to do them, and caused no pain to people who didn’t do them,

00:15:17.648 --> 00:15:24.528
therefore it make no sense for them to be prohibited by law, for them to not be allowed by law.

00:15:24.678 --> 00:15:28.568
There was no good reason for homosexuality to be illegal.

00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:37.238
And he was also one of the earliest proponents of animal rights, again, using the same framework.

00:15:38.368 --> 00:15:43.628
He agreed that animals could be killed if the pleasure that was obtained from their

00:15:43.628 --> 00:15:49.748
death was greater than the pain caused, so they could be killed for food, for example.

00:15:50.268 --> 00:15:55.978
And there could be experiments done on animals if the pleasure that would result from

00:15:55.978 --> 00:16:01.878
them would be greater on aggregate, in total, than the pain caused to that animal.

00:16:02.968 --> 00:16:07.398
The previous system for thinking about the treatment of animals had been

00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:13.318
based on the fact that animals can not reason, they cannot think rationally,

00:16:13.648 --> 00:16:17.778
therefore they shouldn’t be considered in the same category as humans.

00:16:18.878 --> 00:16:26.588
But Bentham, forever the logician, using logic to evaluate every argument, suggested

00:16:26.588 --> 00:16:32.768
that if that were the case, and the ability to reason was what decided who had

00:16:32.778 --> 00:16:39.908
rights and who didn’t, then human babies and some adults with disabilities should

00:16:39.928 --> 00:16:45.808
also not have those rights, therefore the previous way of thinking made no sense.

00:16:46.858 --> 00:16:53.028
Instead, coming back to utilitarianism, Bentham proposed that the deciding factor

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:58.988
should be whether animals can feel, whether they can sense pain or pleasure.

00:16:59.949 --> 00:17:05.909
Animals can, of course, feel, they can sense pleasure and pain, therefore we should consider

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:12.669
actions towards them in exactly the same way in which we think about actions towards fellow humans.

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:19.589
Now, although Bentham’s ideas and utilitarianism were not without their critics, and

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:25.289
there are certainly imperfections in his theories, they were hugely influential in

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:30.709
England, and have had an impact on philosophers and legal systems all over the world.

00:17:31.889 --> 00:17:39.289
Indeed, if a lot of the theories we’ve talked about today seem not that revolutionary to you now, it

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:46.529
is probably because the legal systems that exist today are greatly influenced by utilitarian ideas.

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:54.609
When he died, on June 6, 1832, Bentham was true to his utilitarian beliefs.

00:17:55.209 --> 00:18:00.059
He could have asked to be buried, but what pleasure would that cause anyone?

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:06.029
Instead, he wanted his death to result in the greatest utility, the

00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:11.919
greatest benefit, the greatest pleasure to mankind, so what did he do?

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:15.979
Firstly, he donated it to medical science, and

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:20.869
requested for it to be dissected, for it to be cut up.

00:18:20.869 --> 00:18:26.489
Further to that, he also requested for something called an auto-icon to be created.

00:18:27.219 --> 00:18:31.259
Now, Bentham really invented this concept, so I don’t

00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:34.479
blame you if you haven’t heard the term ‘auto-icon’ before.

00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:38.579
Essentially it means that he wanted his body to be

00:18:38.589 --> 00:18:42.769
embalmed and put on display so that others could see it.

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:47.079
And you can still see Jeremy Bentham’s body today.

00:18:47.509 --> 00:18:53.869
It actually sits in a glass cabinet in my old university, University College London.

00:18:55.189 --> 00:19:00.439
Jeremy Bentham was the spiritual founder of University College London, which was

00:19:00.449 --> 00:19:07.389
founded on utilitarian ideas of equality and justice, and there is this glass

00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:13.189
box in the entrance hall of the university with Jeremy Bentham sitting there,

00:19:13.449 --> 00:19:18.919
dressed up and looking as if he is thinking about a tough philosophical problem.

00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:24.029
It is his real body, although the head is a waxwork.

00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:32.059
In a slightly gruesome twist, the original head was stolen by students from a rival

00:19:32.059 --> 00:19:38.439
university, King's College London, in 1989, before being returned a few weeks later.

00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:43.739
Legend has it that they actually played football with

00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:46.569
the head as they took it back to their university.

00:19:47.849 --> 00:19:54.279
Then a year later, after the original, the real head had been safely locked away

00:19:54.449 --> 00:20:00.739
and replaced with the waxwork one, it was stolen again, by students from the same

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:06.209
rival university, before being returned to University College, where it now remains.

00:20:06.719 --> 00:20:10.709
No doubt the students gained a lot of pleasure and happiness by stealing

00:20:10.719 --> 00:20:14.719
Bentham’s head, but it caused a lot of pain to University College.

00:20:15.769 --> 00:20:22.299
So, was the pleasure of stealing and playing with the head greater than the pain of it being stolen?

00:20:23.479 --> 00:20:27.289
Who knows what Jeremy Bentham would think, but he would certainly be

00:20:27.299 --> 00:20:31.679
happy that we were looking at the question through a utilitarian lens.

00:20:34.189 --> 00:20:38.519
OK then, that is it for  this little introduction to Jeremy Bentham.

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:44.489
He gave us a framework for life, an ethical framework for how to structure

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:49.669
societies for the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.

00:20:49.689 --> 00:20:53.179
Whether we believe it’s the right framework is another question.

00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:58.339
And as to the question of what happiness really is, that of

00:20:58.339 --> 00:21:01.539
course is one Bentham left for us to figure out for ourselves.

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:06.409

Hello hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.569
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.829
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:27.229
I’m Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Madame Tussauds.

00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:34.929
Now, this was a request from one of our members, a lovely lady called Isabel, and I had to

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:41.789
confess that when she asked me to make this, I wasn’t sure that there was all that much to say.

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:48.799
But it turns out that Madame Tussauds has a fascinating backstory, that takes

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:54.479
us to the French Revolution, to the guillotine, before arriving in London.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:59.649
It is quite a ride, so I hope you enjoy this episode.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.829
Before we get right into it though, I just wanted to remind those of you listening

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:12.569
to this episode on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iVoox, or whatever podcast app you

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:18.139
might be listening to it on, that you can get all of the bonus episodes, subtitles,

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.879
transcripts, and key vocabulary, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.949
If you are looking for a more interesting way to improve your English, then I’d

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:34.419
definitely recommend checking that out - you can also find out how to become

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.629
a member of Leonardo English, which means you don’t only get access to all

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:45.079
the bonus materials, but it also means you can do stuff like request episodes.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.759
And as this one shows, we do actually make them.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.769
Ok then, let’s get started.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.309
Madame Tussauds, in case you have never heard of it, is a famous

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:03.169
waxworks museum - a museum with sculptures of famous people.

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:12.476
It is now a global brand with museums across Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia.

00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:17.516
And the story of how it started is pretty interesting.

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:25.016
I should add, that the story of the Madame Tussaud, the woman behind the

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:30.786
museum is only really known through her own memoirs, her own accounts.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:35.216
A lot of it can't really be verified elsewhere.

00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:42.166
And some of it is a little farfetched, a little bit difficult to believe

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:48.926
Just in case you don't know what I mean by waxworking, it is the process

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:55.126
of creating a sculpture, which is then coated, covered, in wax and painted.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:03:02.526
The final result, if you are trying to reproduce someone's features and you are a good

00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:09.646
artist, is that you have a sculpture that looks exactly like, or at least it should

00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:16.366
look exactly like, its subject - the same height, same hairstyle, the same everything.

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:21.926
It’s as if that person were right there in the room with you.

00:03:23.426 --> 00:03:23.836
So the story of Madame Tussauds, the most famous waxworks in the world,

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:36.009
starts in Strasbourg, France, in 1761, with the birth of Marie Grosholtz.

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:45.397
Six years after Marie was born, her mother moved to Bern, Switzerland, to be

00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:53.840
the housekeeper of an anatomist and waxmaker, a man called Phillipe Curtius.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.214
The young Marie was very interested in the work of her

00:03:57.234 --> 00:04:02.374
mother’s boss, and she showed an early talent for sculpture.

00:04:04.204 --> 00:04:12.454
Curtius was only too happy to have an eager student, and he taught her everything about waxworking.

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:21.029
But the prospects for someone involved with waxworks weren't all that great in Bern, and

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.459
so Curtius decided to go to Paris to seek his fortune, as was quite common back then.

00:04:28.829 --> 00:04:33.299
He left his young apprentice, Marie, and her mother in Bern.

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.629
And they joined him a year later.

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.669
After Curtius switched from doing waxworks of people's anatomy ,  of body parts,

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:49.709
to doing waxworks of actual people, he started seeing a lot more interest.

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:56.410
Curtius's work was soon noticed by Paris high society and his

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.930
waxworks drew huge crowds, they attracted a lot of people.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:08.653
This was before the invention of the camera, but after the boom in newspaper circulation.

00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:16.393
These waxworks must have been fascinating - a way to see people in

00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:21.352
real life, the people who you had perhaps read about in the news.

00:05:21.352 --> 00:05:26.902
It was almost as if you were right there in the flesh with them.

00:05:28.752 --> 00:05:32.252
But it wasn’t just Curtius that was becoming famous.

00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:36.932
His young apprentice, Marie, was getting noticed as well.

00:05:38.332 --> 00:05:45.862
So much so that around 1780, when she was not even 20 years old, she was invited

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:52.382
to join the Royal Court at Versailles to teach art to King Louis XVI’s sister.

00:05:53.872 --> 00:06:00.672
She started to get a name for herself, and reportedly created perfect waxworks

00:06:00.942 --> 00:06:07.702
of some of the most famous people in 18th century Paris - Voltaire, and even

00:06:07.942 --> 00:06:12.892
Benjamin Franklin, who was the American ambassador to France at the time.

00:06:14.662 --> 00:06:18.622
However, this was just before the French revolution, a

00:06:18.722 --> 00:06:22.152
dangerous time to be friendly with the French monarchy.

00:06:23.352 --> 00:06:27.932
You had to be very careful who you were seen to be socialising with,

00:06:28.482 --> 00:06:33.782
otherwise you could find your head separated from the rest of your body.

00:06:35.297 --> 00:06:41.047
As it was clear what direction public opinion was heading in, her boss

00:06:41.107 --> 00:06:47.022
and mentor, Curtius, realised that he needed to adapt to the times.

00:06:48.082 --> 00:06:54.582
It would no longer be acceptable to make celebratory waxworks of people who might be

00:06:54.582 --> 00:07:00.852
considered politically sensitive, and he needed to make some changes to stay alive.

00:07:02.102 --> 00:07:10.962
So, in what seems like quite a clever move, he changed the business to creating waxworks of

00:07:11.012 --> 00:07:18.562
recently executed people, politicians and aristocrats who had their heads cut off at the guillotine.

00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:24.208
People could now come to his museum and marvel at

00:07:24.228 --> 00:07:28.008
the waxworks of others who had recently been killed.

00:07:28.588 --> 00:07:32.908
They could stand right there in front of the heads of famous

00:07:32.908 --> 00:07:37.308
people who had been executed at the guillotine just weeks before.

00:07:38.928 --> 00:07:47.258
But the danger still hadn't lifted for Marie Grosholtz, and according to her memoirs, she almost

00:07:47.348 --> 00:07:55.058
met the same fate as Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, of having her head separated from her body.

00:07:56.858 --> 00:08:03.408
Remember, she had spent several years socialising at Versailles, and so it was

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:09.988
difficult for her to suddenly claim she was pro-revolution and anti-monarchy.

00:08:11.338 --> 00:08:17.888
In the ‘reign of terror’ which went on from 1793-1794,

00:08:18.398 --> 00:08:22.441
she was arrested, along with Josephine de Beauharnais,

00:08:22.441 --> 00:08:24.383
the future wife of Napoleon.

00:08:25.643 --> 00:08:29.413
The revolutionaries were looking to execute anyone

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:33.353
who they thought had sympathies towards the monarchy.

00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:38.443
And Marie looked like she was heading for the guillotine.

00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:48.713
They even went so far as to shave her head, preparing her for the cold steel of the guillotine.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.260
However, she made a deal at the last minute

00:08:54.115 --> 00:09:02.530
.
She agreed to make death masks of everyone who was executed, masks to preserve the features of

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:10.490
these people, so that waxworks could be created, and their images displayed for the people to see.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.060
Curtius, her boss, had been making models, but Marie was to make death

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:22.290
masks - real waxworks of the dead people, using their real heads.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:28.010
The revolutionaries agreed, and Marie's life was spared.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:35.980
She was safe, finally, although this sounds like a pretty gruesome

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:42.780
task - waiting for a head to arrive, then preparing a death mask for it.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.480
Shortly after this, her boss and mentor, Curtius, died.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.820
He left everything to Marie, who was only in her early thirties.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:10:04.250
She then married a man called Francois Tussaud, changed her name to Marie Tussaud, and had two sons.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:12.220
But her husband was, by all accounts, a bit hopeless, and it wasn’t a happy marriage.

00:10:13.274 --> 00:10:18.704
A relationship that did have a big impact on Marie though, and one that changed the

00:10:18.724 --> 00:10:27.174
course of her destiny, was a relationship with a German illusionist called Paul Philidor.

00:10:27.174 --> 00:10:33.614
He was a magician, and he created amazing shows which used lights

00:10:34.094 --> 00:10:39.274
and projections to make it seem like there were ghosts and spirits.

00:10:40.694 --> 00:10:47.104
He persuaded Marie to do a show together in London, which they did, in 1802.

00:10:48.164 --> 00:10:53.624
But according to her records, Tussaud didn’t do very well out of it,

00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:59.164
she didn’t make much money, and broke ties with Philidor, the magician.

00:11:00.444 --> 00:11:04.144
But she couldn’t go back to France - the Napoleonic War

00:11:04.154 --> 00:11:08.824
had started in 1803, and there was no way to return.

00:11:08.824 --> 00:11:16.506
Instead she travelled around the UK with her waxwork collection for almost 30 years.

00:11:17.382 --> 00:11:19.698
The British public loved it.

00:11:20.588 --> 00:11:28.548
Her show combined a lot of things that immediately attracted the attention of the British people.

00:11:28.548 --> 00:11:35.498
Firstly, there was this French revolution that had been going on in our nearest neighbour in Europe.

00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:41.251
Members of the royal family and several prominent politicians had lost their heads.

00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:49.141
Tussaud’s exhibition offered a way to see these unfortunate people, up close and personal,

00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:54.847
by someone who had literally created their death masks, according to her at least.

00:11:56.322 --> 00:12:04.992
Secondly, there were very few public executions in the UK by that time, and so Tussaud’s show

00:12:05.242 --> 00:12:11.802
offered the public a way to see some of the blood and gore that they couldn’t see in real life.

00:12:13.262 --> 00:12:17.252
There was nothing else like it, and the show was met

00:12:17.302 --> 00:12:21.382
with crowds and paying customers everywhere she went.

00:12:21.392 --> 00:12:29.672
So almost from the outset, almost from right at the start, it was a very profitable business.

00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:36.734
But after almost 30 years on the road around the UK, she settled on a

00:12:36.734 --> 00:12:42.184
location in London, where customers could come and see these waxworks.

00:12:43.724 --> 00:12:51.724
Her sons came over from Paris and joined the family business, so it became Madame Tussaud & Sons.

00:12:53.304 --> 00:12:58.004
Her sons proved to be worthy additions to the business, carving

00:12:58.084 --> 00:13:03.234
arms and legs to go with their mothers eerily realistic faces.

00:13:05.044 --> 00:13:09.684
After outgrowing its original location, the museum moved

00:13:09.774 --> 00:13:13.934
to its current location in Baker Street, in central London.

00:13:15.454 --> 00:13:19.034
If you have ever been there, you will know that there are

00:13:19.034 --> 00:13:23.174
queues that go around the block almost every single day.

00:13:24.674 --> 00:13:27.424
The rest is, as they say, history.

00:13:28.204 --> 00:13:34.884
The museum attracts around 2.5 million people every year, and is

00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:40.584
said to have welcomed over 500 million visitors since it opened.

00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:48.024
There is evidently something quite timeless about waxworks - whether that’s

00:13:48.794 --> 00:13:53.614
seeing the likeness of a French revolutionary back in 1810, or it's in 2020

00:13:53.854 --> 00:14:01.063
and going to take a selfie with a waxwork of David Beckham or The Queen.

00:14:02.723 --> 00:14:08.943
Madame Tussauds has tapped into something inherently human it would seem, and I’m

00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:16.053
sure they’re banking on 500 million more people visiting it before people get bored.

00:14:17.173 --> 00:14:23.967
If you go there today, you won’t immediately notice any sign of the original Tussaud, Marie.

00:14:25.277 --> 00:14:30.157
The museum was bought by a huge entertainment group for £1 billion

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:37.947
back in 2007, and it is now a well-oiled, commercial enterprise.

00:14:39.937 --> 00:14:46.457
Some of the original, Madame Tussaud waxworks are still there, but the most important thing

00:14:46.697 --> 00:14:53.357
that she left behind, and the thing that no one can ever take away, is this fantastic story.

00:14:54.967 --> 00:15:02.207
Yes, the story comes from her own memoirs, and there is a little bit of debate about how much

00:15:02.407 --> 00:15:11.287
is actually true, and how much is slightly elaborated, but if there’s anyone who knew how

00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:18.317
thin the line is between reality and fantasy, between life and death, it is Madame Tussaud.

00:15:20.217 --> 00:15:24.597
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on Madame Tussauds.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:31.912
It is a pretty good story, and it is always amazing to see that there

00:15:31.912 --> 00:15:37.122
is such an interesting history to something that a lot of people,

00:15:37.532 --> 00:15:42.262
including myself until a few days ago, thought was just a normal museum.

00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:48.722
As a final reminder, if you are looking for the transcript, subtitles,

00:15:48.722 --> 00:15:53.752
key vocabulary, bonus episodes, and a load of other goodies, then

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:58.042
I’d recommend checking out our website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:15:58.652 --> 00:16:03.622
It is full of loads of interesting resources about how to learn English in

00:16:03.622 --> 00:16:08.472
a more interesting way, especially if you don’t live in an English-speaking

00:16:08.472 --> 00:16:13.222
country, so that is well worth checking out if you haven’t done so already.

00:16:14.412 --> 00:16:18.382

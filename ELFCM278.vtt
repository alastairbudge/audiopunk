Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.908 --> 00:00:16.458
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:20.458
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:26.948
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Russian oligarchs in London.

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:33.168
It’s a story of extreme wealth, of greed and hypocrisy, of globalisation,

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:38.068
of the law, of politics, of the media, and of East meets West.

00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:44.498
It’s also a story that was, until very recently, conveniently not talked about very much.

00:00:44.972 --> 00:00:50.188
But the invasion of Ukraine in February of 2022 put a change to that,

00:00:50.188 --> 00:00:54.108
with British politicians finally admitting that Britain’s capital

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:58.068
had become a safe haven for Russian money linked to the Kremlin.

00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:04.981
So that is what we’ll be talking about today, how and why did Russian oligarchs fall in love

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:11.101
with London, and what does the future hold for the city some had come to call “Londongrad”.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.084
OK then, Russian oligarchs in London.

00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:22.864
On July 1st of 2003 it was announced in the British press that a Russian

00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:28.054
called Roman Abramovich had bought Chelsea football club for £140 million.

00:01:29.254 --> 00:01:33.604
Not many Chelsea fans had heard of this man before, but they didn’t

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:37.824
complain as he poured hundreds of millions of pounds into the club,

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:42.944
turning it into a top-tier team that has won dozens of trophies.

00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:48.054
Abramovich became an increasingly known figure in the British media.

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:53.524
He would be photographed at influential society events, like Wimbledon, and

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:58.874
stars like Paul McCartney and Leonardo Di Caprio would be seen at his parties.

00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:03.554
He snapped up properties at London’s fanciest addresses,

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:08.474
including a £90 million house that used to be the Soviet Embassy.

00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:14.184
Roman Abramovich might have been the first high profile Russian businessman

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:19.344
that people in Britain were introduced to, but he was far from the only one.

00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:25.794
London is now called home by thousands of wealthy Russians, and by

00:02:25.924 --> 00:02:30.224
“wealthy”, I do not mean someone with a high salary who sometimes

00:02:30.244 --> 00:02:33.834
goes on nice holidays and eats at nice restaurants from time to time.

00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:36.954
I mean a different level of “wealthy”.

00:02:37.374 --> 00:02:41.384
A level of wealth which involves buying multi-million dollar yachts,

00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:46.104
summer houses in the south of France, fine art, chauffeured limousines,

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:51.324
helicopters, and a fleet of personal assistants waiting on your every request.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:55.994
A level of wealth that is, when possessed by a Russian

00:02:55.994 --> 00:03:00.604
businessman, normally associated with one word: oligarch.

00:03:01.464 --> 00:03:05.504
Now, you no doubt don’t need me to tell you what an oligarch is.

00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:11.064
The term was first used by Aristotle, but in recent years it has come to

00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:16.564
be associated with a small group of men who amassed huge fortunes after the

00:03:16.564 --> 00:03:21.424
collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent deregulation of the Russian economy.

00:03:22.694 --> 00:03:27.304
Long story short, as state assets were privatised, they were sold off

00:03:27.354 --> 00:03:31.674
to private individuals at a very low price, allowing the people who

00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:36.974
managed to control these assets to acquire vast wealth at a tiny cost.

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:39.911
Abramovich was one of these men.

00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:44.961
But he is far from the only oligarch to have called London home.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:51.731
Russian oligarchs have snapped up, they have bought some of London’s most desirable

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:56.331
properties, sent their children to Britain’s most exclusive private schools,

00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:01.551
listed their companies on London’s stock exchange, bought fine art at London’s

00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:06.911
exclusive art galleries, bought football clubs and made London their second home.

00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:15.351
So much so that the press started to nickname London “Londongrad”, or “Moscow on Thames”.

00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:19.411
The question you may have is…why?

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:26.361
Why London, why not Paris, Rome, Berlin, Madrid, New York, or any other world city?

00:04:27.171 --> 00:04:32.691
Well, London certainly has lots to offer from a cultural and entertainment point of view.

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:37.151
Shops, theatres, good restaurants, bars, and so on.

00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:41.911
There are also plenty of other very wealthy and influential people who

00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:46.411
you can become friends with, so you can feel at home as a billionaire.

00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:54.321
There’s also the very practical reason that London isn’t so far from Moscow - it’s a mere three and

00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:59.991
a half hour flight, which if you consider that you’ll be going in a private jet so you don’t have

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:05.355
to worry about tedious things like waiting around to board the aeroplane, it’s no distance at all.

00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:11.711
But these are all relatively trivial, or unimportant things.

00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:18.351
You can find these in Rome, Paris or Berlin, so what’s special about London?

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:21.351
Well, two things in particular.

00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:24.791
The legal system, and the financial system.

00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:31.821
Let’s talk about the law first, and we are going to focus on two areas of the law.

00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:35.771
Its strength, and a particular aspect of the law

00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:39.311
called “libel”, which makes it attractive to oligarchs.

00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:41.991
First, the strength of English law.

00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:47.471
The UK is a politically stable country with a strong legal systems.

00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:51.311
English law is frequently used by countries outside the

00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:55.921
UK as an example of a strong and sound legal system.

00:05:56.841 --> 00:06:02.681
This makes it a good place to consider as a second home and as a space to park

00:06:02.681 --> 00:06:08.071
or store large amounts of money, because, as long as you stay within the law in

00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:13.261
the UK, the British state is not going to try to steal your house or your money.

00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:18.861
Indeed, what better place to put your money than in a large house in the middle

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:23.239
of a European capital city, where it will be protected by the strong rule of law?

00:06:24.086 --> 00:06:28.531
You might be listening to this and thinking, “well of course a European country isn’t

00:06:28.531 --> 00:06:33.343
going to try to steal your money”, but to a Russian oligarch, this wasn’t obvious at all.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:39.461
Oligarchs like Abramovich had seen first-hand how the fortunes of other

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:44.671
oligarchs, other men just like them, had been taken back by the Russian state.

00:06:45.631 --> 00:06:50.841
This was perhaps most vividly and grotesquely illustrated by the fate of

00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:55.821
one oligarch, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who openly challenged Vladiminir Putin.

00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:59.361
You might remember seeing pictures of his trial.

00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:04.711
As a defendant, he was placed in a cage – not an ordinary cage,

00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:09.811
but a big one which made him look like a caged and deranged animal.

00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:16.351
Khodorkovsky made the error of standing up to his president, and he paid the price.

00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:22.311
He was found guilty of corruption, was put in jail for 10 years and then expelled from Russia.

00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:28.081
The message to the oligarchs was clear - everything you have is thanks to

00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:33.181
the Russian state, and it can be taken away just as quickly as it was given.

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.351
So, the appeal of a legal system that isn’t going

00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:40.361
to take your money and property from you was clear.

00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:45.601
Now, the second aspect of English law that was particularly important

00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:49.281
to Russian oligarchs is to do with something called “libel”.

00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:55.292
Essentially, what this means is that if a journalist or author writes something

00:07:55.316 --> 00:08:00.830
about me that I don't think is true or that presents me in a bad light, I can

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.920
sue them, I can take them to court for an almost limitless amount of money.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.740
And the English system is particularly favourable to

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.714
people with lots of money to pay expensive lawyers.

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:17.604
Let me explain this further because it is an important

00:08:17.684 --> 00:08:21.624
element of London's attractiveness to people like oligarchs.

00:08:22.204 --> 00:08:28.804
If, for example, a journalist researches and aims to publish a book exposing the corruption

00:08:28.844 --> 00:08:34.764
of a powerful person, whether an oligarch or a president, the English legal system and

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:41.384
the law surrounding libel means that the person who has been accused of the crimes has

00:08:41.384 --> 00:08:47.424
only to show that he or she has had harm caused to them as a result of what has been said.

00:08:48.274 --> 00:08:54.704
The defendant, the person who wrote these things, has to prove that what he or she has written

00:08:54.934 --> 00:09:00.884
is true, and evidently when it comes to writing about the behaviour of anyone in a position

00:09:00.884 --> 00:09:06.404
of power, being able to prove without a doubt that something has happened is not easy.

00:09:07.124 --> 00:09:10.404
This system has been used by oligarchs in order to stop

00:09:10.424 --> 00:09:13.524
important pieces of investigative journalism being published.

00:09:14.354 --> 00:09:19.344
There was a book by an author called Karen Dawisha called "Putin's Kleptocracy:

00:09:19.604 --> 00:09:24.514
Who Owns Russia?”, which was initially rejected by British publishers because

00:09:24.684 --> 00:09:30.044
it was too risky to publish, and was only taken on by American publishers.

00:09:31.024 --> 00:09:36.554
For a journalist or a publisher, if they are accused of libel by an oligarch it

00:09:36.554 --> 00:09:42.724
becomes very expensive to fight the case even if what they know they published is true.

00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:48.894
So these articles and books simply aren’t published, which results in London,

00:09:48.944 --> 00:09:53.935
and the UK in general, being a place where the rich and powerful know that they

00:09:53.935 --> 00:09:58.925
can be safe from too many investigative journalists prying into their business.

00:09:59.855 --> 00:10:06.595
Now, the second reason for the attractiveness of London was for its hub as a financial centre.

00:10:07.535 --> 00:10:13.735
Starting really in the 1970s and 1980s, London became a global financial hub.

00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:19.545
Hundreds of billions of dollars pass through London’s banks every day, and with this

00:10:19.555 --> 00:10:24.785
growth in the amount of money flowing around came a growth in all of the other kinds of

00:10:24.785 --> 00:10:30.935
associated services: lawyers, accountants, public relations, private bankers and so on.

00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:35.735
If you need to move a lot of money around, having a small army

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:39.555
of bankers, lawyers and accountants evidently comes in handy.

00:10:40.725 --> 00:10:46.495
What’s more, the UK has very loose laws relating to company ownership, which

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:53.165
means hiding your money and assets from prying eyes is very easy to do in the UK.

00:10:54.115 --> 00:10:58.085
In practical terms, it’s very easy to set up a company.

00:10:58.465 --> 00:11:02.785
In fact, anyone can do it, you don’t need to send in any documents,

00:11:02.935 --> 00:11:08.365
it takes just a few minutes and it costs £12 - under $15.

00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:13.175
If you don’t believe me, just try it - you could have set up a full UK

00:11:13.175 --> 00:11:16.585
company in less than the time you’ve been listening to this episode.

00:11:17.782 --> 00:11:24.195
UK law is also very happy for companies to be owned by other companies, often based in

00:11:24.395 --> 00:11:29.975
former British colonies or territories - places like Jersey, the Cayman Islands or Malta.

00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:36.395
These companies are then, in turn, owned by other companies, meaning that there is a long and

00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:42.605
complicated web of ownership and it is very hard to figure out who actually owns anything.

00:11:43.785 --> 00:11:48.995
And this is a wonderful system if you are trying to move money around the world

00:11:49.035 --> 00:11:54.015
and buy things without people actually knowing it is you who is buying them.

00:11:55.075 --> 00:12:02.815
UK law allows “companies” to buy things like houses and property, so that £90 million house

00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:08.315
I mentioned earlier that was bought by Roman Abramovich, I should say “reportedly”, because

00:12:08.485 --> 00:12:13.825
it was actually bought by another company which is reportedly controlled by Roman Abramovich.

00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:19.875
Indeed, you can go to these ultra-expensive areas of London - Mayfair and Knightsbridge - and

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:25.515
if you were to look at who actually bought the houses there, the houses that were lived in by

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:31.815
billionaires and multibillionaires, almost all of them would theoretically be owned by obscure

00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:37.115
companies that might be themselves owned by other companies in the Cayman Islands or Bermuda.

00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:39.615
You see where we are going here.

00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:47.345
The UK legal and financial system means it is very easy not only to disguise ownership of what you

00:12:47.355 --> 00:12:53.425
have, but it also makes it very hard for someone to get their hands on it even if they wanted to.

00:12:54.925 --> 00:12:59.125
This is one of the problems that the UK government faced when it

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:03.715
finally decided to sanction Russian oligarchs in March of 2022.

00:13:04.615 --> 00:13:08.185
We’ll get onto that in a minute, but first it’s important to highlight

00:13:08.245 --> 00:13:13.015
two additional factors about the UK's attraction for oligarchs.

00:13:13.805 --> 00:13:15.535
The first is a practical factor.

00:13:16.455 --> 00:13:20.185
You might think that the UK is a difficult country to immigrate

00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:24.675
to, and that it is hard and complicated to get a British passport.

00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:29.355
It is for most people, but it isn’t if you have enough money.

00:13:30.085 --> 00:13:33.935
And by enough, I mean tens or hundreds of millions of pounds.

00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:40.025
See, while countries like St Kitts, Cyprus or Malta might be better known

00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:44.615
as countries that sell their passports, the UK will quite happily give

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:49.625
you what it calls a “Tier 1” visa, otherwise known as a “golden visa”.

00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:56.205
It’s called a “golden” visa because, as you might have guessed, you need a lot of money to get one.

00:13:57.485 --> 00:14:04.595
Specifically, if you invested at least £2 million you could get residency in the UK, and the

00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:10.285
more you invested, the quicker your application for “permanent residency” would be processed.

00:14:11.345 --> 00:14:16.795
£2 million might be out of reach for most people, but it was pocket change for

00:14:16.795 --> 00:14:22.795
an oligarch, and between 2008 when the scheme was launched and 2020 when it was

00:14:22.795 --> 00:14:30.725
suspended due to the pandemic, 2,581 of these visas were issued to wealthy Russians.

00:14:31.905 --> 00:14:36.875
Indeed, paying £2 million in order to protect a fortune that is in the

00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:41.825
hundreds of millions if not billions was, for many, just good common sense.

00:14:43.165 --> 00:14:49.265
The second factor to mention is less practical, but equally if not more important.

00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:54.145
And that’s to do with the links between oligarchs and British politics,

00:14:54.303 --> 00:14:58.585
especially the Conservative party, the party now in power in the UK.

00:14:59.995 --> 00:15:04.065
Like in Russia, oligarchs realised early on that it

00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:07.165
paid to be on good terms with the political class.

00:15:07.722 --> 00:15:13.818
Oligarchs have donated millions of pounds to the Conservative party, and made sure that British

00:15:13.868 --> 00:15:19.188
lords and powerful politicians have well-paid jobs sitting on the boards of their companies.

00:15:20.088 --> 00:15:27.198
In January of 2009, a billionaire ex-KGB agent called Alexander Lebedev

00:15:27.198 --> 00:15:31.368
was announced as the new owner of London’s Evening Standard newspaper.

00:15:32.218 --> 00:15:36.848
Lebedev has claimed that he is no oligarch, and that he is actually out

00:15:36.858 --> 00:15:41.128
of favour with the Russian state, but not everyone seems to believe him.

00:15:42.288 --> 00:15:47.878
Indeed, whatever Lebedev says, he is, or at least has been, too close to the Kremlin.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:49.228
One

00:15:49.228 --> 00:15:54.781
person who was at least one degree removed, however, was his son, Evgeny Lebedev.

00:15:55.881 --> 00:16:00.118
Evgeny, who was only 29 when his father bought this British newspaper

00:16:00.378 --> 00:16:04.948
has become a highly influential figure in British high society, even

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:08.048
befriending the up and coming British politician, Boris Johnson.

00:16:09.462 --> 00:16:14.358
Evgeny Lebedev, this son of an oligarch, completed his transition to

00:16:14.358 --> 00:16:19.508
the top of British society when he was given a peerage, the technical

00:16:19.508 --> 00:16:23.348
term for when you become a member of the House of Lords, in 2020.

00:16:24.568 --> 00:16:29.568
Eyebrows were raised in the British press when Boris Johnson announced that his friend was

00:16:29.568 --> 00:16:35.658
given this high honour, but this became even more controversial when it was revealed that the

00:16:35.668 --> 00:16:41.468
British security services had expressed their concern about Lebedev becoming a Lord, given his

00:16:41.478 --> 00:16:47.928
father’s links to the Kremlin, but Boris Johnson had dismissed these concerns as unimportant.

00:16:48.718 --> 00:16:54.678
Now, this is not of course to suggest that Lebedev has done anything wrong or untoward,

00:16:54.678 --> 00:17:01.048
but rather to illustrate quite how entwined these two worlds have become: that the

00:17:01.048 --> 00:17:07.668
son of a billionaire ex-KGB agent now has the title of “Baron Lebedev, of Hampton in

00:17:07.668 --> 00:17:12.198
the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and of Siberia in the Russian Federation”.

00:17:13.698 --> 00:17:19.218
And for the best part of 30 years, Russian money has been pouring into London.

00:17:19.498 --> 00:17:22.478
And it has made a lot of people very rich.

00:17:23.158 --> 00:17:28.478
From the bankers handling the oligarchs' money to the lawyers representing them in court,

00:17:28.608 --> 00:17:34.238
from the public affairs professionals handling their media relations to the estate agents

00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:39.488
selling their houses, from the private schools educating their children to the luxury

00:17:39.488 --> 00:17:44.928
shops catering to their every wish, these oligarchs brought with them a lot of money.

00:17:45.728 --> 00:17:50.518
And for people who were providing services to the oligarchs, perhaps as you

00:17:50.518 --> 00:17:55.138
might expect, there was little questioning about where this money came from.

00:17:56.038 --> 00:18:03.418
Roman Abramovich was only 36 years old when he bought Chelsea for £140 million, and he had amassed

00:18:03.448 --> 00:18:09.418
a multi-billion dollar fortune through acquiring Russian state assets at below-market prices.

00:18:10.408 --> 00:18:16.018
In the case of practically every oligarch, the spectacular wealth they had amassed came

00:18:16.018 --> 00:18:21.728
from close links to the Kremlin, and from getting their hands on reduced-price state assets.

00:18:22.338 --> 00:18:26.058
In short, there were some question marks about the legality

00:18:26.058 --> 00:18:28.908
and honesty with which they had acquired their money.

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:36.378
But they had so much money, and they were able to pay so much, that few questions were asked.

00:18:37.218 --> 00:18:41.998
After all, money is money, and British politicians were all too happy

00:18:41.998 --> 00:18:46.288
to encourage any rich foreigners to invest in the country, regardless

00:18:46.288 --> 00:18:50.208
of where that money might have come from, or who it might be linked to.

00:18:51.398 --> 00:18:56.578
Indeed, of all of the golden visas, those “Tier 1” visas I mentioned

00:18:56.578 --> 00:19:01.618
earlier, half had been reviewed for potential “national security risks”.

00:19:03.028 --> 00:19:07.468
But while the going had been good for almost 30 years, this

00:19:07.498 --> 00:19:10.728
all changed, of course, with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

00:19:11.588 --> 00:19:16.168
As much of the western world turned to sanctions to exert pressure

00:19:16.348 --> 00:19:19.958
on the Russian regime, the British government, and the British Prime

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.488
Minister, Boris Johnson, was left with an uncomfortable decision.

00:19:24.418 --> 00:19:29.798
Evidently, the UK had to impose sanctions on Russia, but this was condemned as

00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:34.878
somewhat hypocritical, given the fact that over the past 30 years the UK had

00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:39.188
created the perfect living and operating environment for Russian oligarchs.

00:19:40.518 --> 00:19:46.108
Although it is hard to have much sympathy for them, this has understandably left the Russian

00:19:46.148 --> 00:19:52.148
oligarchs feeling somewhat betrayed by the city and country that they had thought was “safe”, a

00:19:52.298 --> 00:19:58.528
place where nobody asked questions as long as the bills had lots of zeros and were paid promptly.

00:19:59.318 --> 00:20:04.168
So, what is next for Londongrad, the destination of choice for the Russian oligarch?

00:20:05.318 --> 00:20:10.378
Well, so long as the war in Ukraine continues, Londongrad is “on pause”.

00:20:10.858 --> 00:20:15.218
The sanctions mean that the oligarch’s assets haven’t been permanently taken

00:20:15.268 --> 00:20:18.698
by the British government, they have just been “kidnapped”, so to speak.

00:20:19.648 --> 00:20:24.758
Of course, the intention behind these sanctions is to get powerful oligarchs to use their

00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:31.198
influence to put pressure on Vladimir Putin and stop the invasion of Ukraine, but, unfortunately,

00:20:31.198 --> 00:20:35.418
as of the time of recording this episode at least, it hasn’t had the desired effect.

00:20:36.438 --> 00:20:41.538
But when the war in Ukraine is over, which one can only hope will be soon, perhaps

00:20:41.538 --> 00:20:45.868
even by the time you’re listening to this, and when sanctions are lifted on Russian

00:20:45.898 --> 00:20:50.958
oligarchs, the question remains about whether things will return to “normal” in

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:56.418
Londongrad, or whether the curtain really has been lifted and the public mood has changed.

00:20:57.418 --> 00:20:58.798
One thing is certainly true.

00:20:59.288 --> 00:21:04.388
Bankers, estate agents, public relations companies, accountants, lawyers,

00:21:04.418 --> 00:21:10.298
and even politicians have all grown fat on thirty years of oligarchs’ cash.

00:21:11.148 --> 00:21:15.798
And while the Russian oligarchs might have been the most conspicuous, the most

00:21:15.848 --> 00:21:20.928
obvious, of the billionaires piling into London, Russians were far from the only ones.

00:21:21.428 --> 00:21:25.618
The city is full of billionaires from all over the world - China,

00:21:25.878 --> 00:21:29.268
the Middle East, West Africa to name just a few places.

00:21:30.018 --> 00:21:33.958
Some, of course, are self-made entrepreneurs in their country and

00:21:34.148 --> 00:21:37.458
their wealth has come from growing large and successful companies.

00:21:38.328 --> 00:21:43.078
But, more often than not, it's sad to say, as in the case of many of the

00:21:43.288 --> 00:21:48.338
oligarchs, the origin of this extreme wealth is not so easy to explain.

00:21:49.198 --> 00:21:54.068
Fortunately for the oligarchs, and in fact now fortunately for anyone with a

00:21:54.088 --> 00:21:59.118
large enough bank balance, London’s bankers, accountants, lawyers and politicians

00:21:59.348 --> 00:22:04.318
are happy to not ask too many questions about where the money really comes from.

00:22:06.468 --> 00:22:11.358
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Russian oligarchs in London.

00:22:11.928 --> 00:22:14.998
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:22:15.568 --> 00:22:18.558
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:22.268
Did you know that London was such a centre for Russian oligarchs?

00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:25.468
I’d especially love to hear from the Russian listeners out there.

00:22:25.798 --> 00:22:27.338
What do you think about this?

00:22:27.398 --> 00:22:28.858
How does it make you feel?

00:22:29.178 --> 00:22:31.338
What do you think the UK should do about it?

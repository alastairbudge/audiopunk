Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:17.336
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:21.626
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:26.276
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:30.896
about Brian Epstein - The Man Who Discovered The Beatles.

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:36.516
If I asked you to name the members of The Beatles, I imagine you could do it.

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:41.086
John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Star.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:46.346
But there was another member, a man Paul McCartney called

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:50.516
“the fifth Beatle”, and his name was Brian Epstein.

00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:56.586
The reason you may not have heard of him is because he didn’t play guitar or sing.

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:59.396
He wasn’t up there on stage with them.

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:05.636
And when you see any pictures of The Beatles, there are four of them, not five.

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:11.266
But Brian Epstein played a hugely important role in the most famous

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:15.936
rock & roll band in history, and we are going to tell that story today.

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:21.396
From his early life to how he discovered the Beatles, how he changed their

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:27.406
image and set them on course for success, but how his life was mired in

00:01:27.466 --> 00:01:33.516
tragedy, and how it all came to a crashing end when he was only 32 years old.

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:38.166
It is a sad but amazing story, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:44.456
OK then, The Tragic Life Of Brian Epstein.

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:51.546
Brian Samuel Epstein was born in 1934, the first-born son of a

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:56.056
middle-class Jewish family in Liverpool, in the north-west of England.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.996
Epstein had a relatively privileged childhood, attending

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:04.776
good schools and living in a good area of the city.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:11.286
His father wanted him to take on the family business, a furniture business that his

00:02:11.296 --> 00:02:17.260
grandfather had founded, which his father had expanded later into a record store.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.420
And Brian Epstein might well have lived a happy, semi-anonymous life, had he not been

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:32.198
working in his family’s record store at 3pm on Saturday, October the 28th of 1961.

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:38.460
An eighteen-year-old boy walked into the store and came up to Epstein.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.920
He said “There’s a record I want.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.430
It’s “My Bonnie” and it was made in Germany.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.580
Have you got it?”

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.920
The record store Epstein was managing was one of the most popular in Liverpool.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.930
They had thousands of records, and people flocked to the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.300
store from all over the north of England to buy music.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.990
But the store didn’t have “My Bonnie”, or at least Epstein didn’t think they had it.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.280
“Who is the record by?”, he asked the boy.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.510
“You won’t have heard of them.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.750
It’s by a group called ‘The Beatles’”.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.450
But Epstein had heard of The Beatles.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.040
He wasn’t just the manager of a family record store.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.100
He was starting to make a name for himself in the music business,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.300
and had recently started writing a music column in a local magazine.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.970
So he had his ear to the ground when it came to up and coming groups,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.730
and he had heard mentions of a group of young men called The Beatles.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:51.510
The Beatles had formed a year earlier, in 1960, but had not seen great success.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.010
They had toured clubs in Liverpool, and spent three

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.900
and a half months playing clubs in Hamburg, in Germany.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.590
But they were far from the Beatles that you might think of.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.210
They tended to wear black leather, and their hair was long and messy.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.170
They played cover songs, they played other bands'

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.750
music, and they didn’t have any songs of their own.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.400
But they were starting to get better known, and the fact that a

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.130
young man came into the store and asked Epstein for that record

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.840
specifically, well, it piqued his interest, he wanted to find out more.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.120
He saw that the band was scheduled to play a concert the following Thursday.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.720
It was a lunchtime concert at a club within walking distance from the record store,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.442
so Epstein decided to use his lunch break to go along and check it out for himself.

00:04:53.954 --> 00:04:59.194
What he saw was the scruffy, untidy group of young men dressed in leather.

00:04:59.874 --> 00:05:04.684
But he sensed that there was something there, there was star potential.

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:12.074
He later said, "I was immediately struck by their music, their beat and their sense of humour

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:19.364
on stage—and, even afterwards, when I met them, I was struck again by their personal charm.

00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:23.464
And it was there that, really, it all started".

00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:28.724
He decided that he wanted to become their manager, and spent

00:05:28.744 --> 00:05:33.554
the next couple of months trying to convince the band to accept.

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:41.434
The first time that Epstein actually proposed managing the band, all four of them were late.

00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:48.374
John Lennon, George Harrison and the previous drummer, Pete Best were at the pub.

00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:54.434
When they finally arrived Epstein was there, but Paul McCartney wasn’t.

00:05:55.314 --> 00:06:00.004
George Harrison told Epstein that McCartney was late because he was

00:06:00.034 --> 00:06:05.074
in the bath, explaining that “he may be late but he’ll be very clean”.

00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:13.994
It took another month for everything to be finalised, but on January 24th of 1962 Brian

00:06:14.024 --> 00:06:21.634
Epstein officially became The Beatles’ manager, entitling himself to 10 to 15% of their income.

00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:29.354
The thing was though, that Epstein had no experience managing a band, he had never done this before.

00:06:30.354 --> 00:06:34.414
He impressed The Beatles because he was a bit older than them - he

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:39.854
was 27 and the oldest member of The Beatles, John Lennon, was only 21.

00:06:40.954 --> 00:06:47.064
What's more, he drove a nice car, he wore nice suits, and he was the manager of one

00:06:47.084 --> 00:06:52.174
of the biggest and most prestigious record stores in Liverpool, the band’s home city.

00:06:53.304 --> 00:06:56.764
The Beatles, on the other hand, came from a very different

00:06:56.774 --> 00:06:59.784
background, they came from a working class background.

00:07:01.044 --> 00:07:05.744
John Lennon, who actually had the most middle-class upbringing of the four

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:11.654
of them, later said, “Epstein looked efficient and rich,” while McCartney

00:07:11.654 --> 00:07:15.884
admitted “we were very impressed by anyone in a suit or with a car.”

00:07:17.044 --> 00:07:18.634
He was also Jewish.

00:07:19.354 --> 00:07:24.794
Although Jewish people still faced significant anti-Semitism in most aspects of

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:30.414
life, and Epstein had been regularly bullied as a child for his Jewish faith,

00:07:30.934 --> 00:07:36.464
reportedly the fact that Epstein was Jewish was helpful with winning over the Beatles.

00:07:37.594 --> 00:07:43.004
This was because of a stereotype Paul McCartney’s father had told his son that

00:07:43.254 --> 00:07:47.354
Jewish people were good with money, and therefore they should trust Epstein.

00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:52.144
So, because of all of this, Epstein was made manager.

00:07:52.964 --> 00:07:57.814
His first move as the band's manager was to tidy up their image.

00:07:58.834 --> 00:08:03.724
Gone were the leather jackets, replaced by smart suits and ties.

00:08:04.314 --> 00:08:11.186
Gone was the long hair, with the young men all now cleanly shaven and with tidy, short haircuts.

00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:19.224
They now bowed on stage, and they stopped smoking, eating and drinking during performances.

00:08:19.714 --> 00:08:24.094
They became a respectable, tidy group of polite young men.

00:08:25.114 --> 00:08:28.524
The group’s fortunes soon started to change.

00:08:29.094 --> 00:08:33.244
Epstein’s reputation as a manager of an important record store

00:08:33.504 --> 00:08:37.714
opened doors for them, and he got them meetings with record labels.

00:08:38.774 --> 00:08:45.444
They were signed to the record label Parlophone in June of 1962, they started recording their

00:08:45.464 --> 00:08:53.078
first album in early 1963, from which almost immediate national, then global, success followed.

00:08:53.828 --> 00:08:58.618
Now, this episode isn’t about The Beatles per se, it’s about Epstein,

00:08:58.948 --> 00:09:03.037
so we will skip over the ins and outs of The Beatles’ career.

00:09:04.017 --> 00:09:06.977
Much of it, I’m sure, is already familiar to you.

00:09:07.827 --> 00:09:12.077
They toured Europe, North America, Australia and East Asia.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:16.317
The band was mobbed by adoring fans everywhere they went,

00:09:16.807 --> 00:09:20.837
so much so that there was even a word for this: Beatlemania.

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:25.277
To state the obvious, they were the biggest, most famous,

00:09:25.317 --> 00:09:29.137
most influential and best known band in the world.

00:09:29.937 --> 00:09:35.117
And Epstein was the glue that kept them together, the man behind the scenes,

00:09:35.287 --> 00:09:40.827
organising tours, TV appearances, negotiating business arrangements, and so on.

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:45.137
He was known as incredibly efficient, hard-working,

00:09:45.437 --> 00:09:48.947
trustworthy, and he made everything run smoothly.

00:09:49.927 --> 00:09:56.017
But Epstein had a secret, or at least a secret that the band knew about

00:09:56.077 --> 00:10:00.487
but was something that was closely guarded and hidden to the outside world.

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:07.307
He was gay, which was a criminal offence in the United Kingdom until 1967.

00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:14.947
And Epstein throughout his life had, like no doubt the majority of gay men at the time, suffered

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:21.537
terribly with trying to live a double life, trying to pretend that he was something that he was not.

00:10:22.687 --> 00:10:27.097
His sexual orientation had got him in trouble from an early age.

00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:32.927
In 1952, at the age of 18, he had been conscripted into

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:36.657
military service, and stationed in a base in London.

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:43.827
He had always taken great pride in his appearance, he liked to dress well, and

00:10:43.827 --> 00:10:49.237
the clothes provided by the army were, well, they didn’t quite meet his standards.

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:56.657
So, he got his own suit made, which looked much more like an officer’s suit than a private’s.

00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:01.957
And when he had a free evening, an evening off, he

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:05.937
would wear this fancy suit and go to bars to meet men.

00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:12.707
One evening, though, he was stopped by the police when he was returning back to his barracks.

00:11:13.397 --> 00:11:19.207
He was wearing what appeared to be an officer’s uniform but he wasn’t an officer.

00:11:20.437 --> 00:11:25.107
It was actually a crime to impersonate an officer, to pretend

00:11:25.107 --> 00:11:29.287
to be an officer, and he was almost kicked out of the army.

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:36.489
He only managed to avoid this by agreeing to see a psychiatrist, after which he was kicked

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:42.979
out of the army for being “emotionally and mentally unfit”, which was code for “gay”.

00:11:44.299 --> 00:11:48.529
Now, none of this mattered to The Beatles, as of course it shouldn’t have.

00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:54.199
They joked about Epstein’s sexuality, joking that he fancied them

00:11:54.249 --> 00:11:58.119
and he wanted to be their manager as a way of getting closer to them.

00:11:58.539 --> 00:12:01.219
But they were all incredibly fond of him.

00:12:02.169 --> 00:12:07.429
And there were actually persistent rumours that Epstein had some sort of sexual

00:12:07.429 --> 00:12:12.529
relationship with John Lennon during a holiday they went on to Barcelona, but

00:12:12.729 --> 00:12:18.919
Lennon denied this, saying "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite.

00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:24.139
It was never consummated ... but we did have a pretty intense relationship."

00:12:25.076 --> 00:12:28.539
Epstein’s double life continued to weigh on him.

00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:34.269
He started taking more and more drugs, and became more out of control than

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:38.479
the boys six years his junior that he was supposed to be in charge of.

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:44.899
He took stimulants, smoked marijuana, and took cocaine and heroin.

00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:49.949
While The Beatles were experimenting with drugs and drinking

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:55.249
heavily, they seemed to know when to stop, but Epstein didn’t.

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:57.889
He was spiraling out of control.

00:12:58.689 --> 00:13:01.269
He was also a voracious gambler.

00:13:01.879 --> 00:13:08.379
He had been growing rich off the Beatles’ success, but he was known to lose money as fast

00:13:08.479 --> 00:13:14.689
as he made it, and was known to lose tens of thousands of pounds in a single evening.

00:13:15.869 --> 00:13:21.169
When the Beatles famously met Elvis Presley in 1965, Elvis’s manager,

00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:26.089
another unusual character called Colonel Tom Parker, reportedly

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:30.639
set up a roulette wheel and Epstein immediately started gambling.

00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:35.199
To anyone who didn’t know what was going on in Epstein’s

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:39.099
life, it might have seemed like he was on top of the world.

00:13:39.816 --> 00:13:44.559
There he was, the thirty-something manager of the most famous band in the

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:50.489
world, immaculately dressed, always on time, looking the part, and arranging

00:13:50.539 --> 00:13:55.539
for his band to fly all over the world and be mobbed by adoring fans.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:14:00.939
Yet beneath the surface, he was in great emotional pain.

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:09.096
It got even worse when The Beatles stopped touring, when they stopped going on tour, in 1966.

00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:17.289
Epstein’s talent and strength had been to keep things together when the band was on the road, and

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:24.429
when they paused to focus on writing new material and recording, well he didn’t have so much to do.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.580
Epstein’s destructive cycle continued, and it only ended when he was

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:38.370
found dead in his flat on August 27th of 1967, aged just 32 years old.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.790
He had accidentally overdosed on a drug called Carbrital,

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.160
which he had been taking to help him get to sleep.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.210
There were suicide notes found in his room, but they had been

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.500
dated from several weeks before, and were hidden inside a book.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.050
It seems like Epstein had considered killing himself at least twice, and had gone

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:08.770
so far as to write two different suicide letters, but had decided against it.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.180
And his death was ruled accidental.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.020
The Beatles were, as you would expect, rocked by the news of

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.580
his death, and the group officially broke up three years later.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.590
Although there were plenty of reasons for the group to split, the

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:31.100
unexpected death of their manager, the “fifth Beatle”, was an important one.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.760
Indeed, John Lennon later said, "I knew that we were in trouble then...

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.610
I thought, 'We've f****** had it now.'"

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.900
Epstein had lived in the Beatles’ shadow, he had managed all of their affairs,

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:51.320
negotiated all of their commercial contracts and done all of the management so that

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:57.300
John, Paul, George and Ringo were able to focus on what they did best: the music.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.670
With Epstein no longer there, there was this gaping hole.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.790
The group did, of course, end up getting another manager, Allen Klein, but it

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:14.450
was not a happy relationship, it was nothing compared to the bond that they had

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:20.010
had with Brian Epstein, a man they affectionately referred to as “Mr Epstein”.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.480
He was, by all accounts, a kind, generous, and loving man.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.670
But he was driven to despair by the cruel laws of the time,

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.630
which prohibited him from being the man he really was.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.850
And although he had never done it before, he was clearly a talented band manager.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.720
He found four untidy young men in a dark Liverpool club

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.330
and turned them into the most famous band on the planet.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.240
You might think that The Beatles might have had just as

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.430
much success, if not more, had they never met Brian Epstein.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.120
You might be right.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:06.910
But the people who were there, who certainly know more than me and I imagine also more than

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:12.530
you, definitely thought that the group owed a considerable part of their success to him.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:19.470
Cynthia Lennon, John Lennon’s first wife, said that they wouldn’t have got anywhere without Brian.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:26.690
And when Paul McCartney was asked about him in a 1997 documentary, he summed up

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:33.080
Epstein’s importance for the group, "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian."

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:42.020
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Brian Epstein - The Man Who Discovered The Beatles

00:17:42.434 --> 00:17:45.853
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:46.514 --> 00:17:51.414
If you’re a Beatles fan, then perhaps you knew about the importance of Epstein already.

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.814
And if you had never heard of him before today, well,

00:17:55.124 --> 00:17:57.474
then you'll know about the man behind The Beatles.

00:17:58.224 --> 00:18:01.583
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:01.884 --> 00:18:06.454
How important do you think Brian Epstein was in the success of The Beatles?

00:18:06.934 --> 00:18:10.074
What would have happened if they hadn’t changed their image?

00:18:10.344 --> 00:18:13.024
How would their music have changed, if at all?

00:18:13.584 --> 00:18:18.314
Without Brian Epstein, would The Beatles as we know them even have existed?

00:18:18.694 --> 00:18:21.994
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:22.404 --> 00:18:25.354

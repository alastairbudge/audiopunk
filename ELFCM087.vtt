Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:15.687
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:20.807
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:26.387
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The

00:00:26.577 --> 00:00:31.963
Illuminati, the secretive group that may or may not control the entire world.

00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:36.973
The episodes we’ve been doing on conspiracy theories seem to be pretty

00:00:36.983 --> 00:00:42.223
popular, and so today we are going to cover the mother of all conspiracy

00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:47.401
theories, the conspiracy theory to rule them all, The Illuminati.

00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:56.165
Its believers say that members of the Illuminati include Beyonce, Jay Z, Madonna, as well

00:00:56.165 --> 00:01:01.995
as hundreds of other secretive, powerful people who pull the strings of everything we do.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:09.215
So today we are going to take a closer look at who the Illuminati really are, or were,

00:01:09.845 --> 00:01:15.405
we’ll take a look at what we actually know about them for sure, how they got started, where

00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:22.705
they came from, why they disappeared, why they then reappeared, and we’ll then discover why

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:29.073
people seem to be so obsessed with them, and why this conspiracy theory just won't go away.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:32.443
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:36.933
To make things a bit easier, we do actually know about the

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:41.493
founding of The Illuminati, this part isn’t a conspiracy theory.

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:51.663
Our story starts in Bavaria, a part of modern day Germany, in 1776, with a man named Adam Weishaupt.

00:01:52.803 --> 00:01:57.623
He was a professor of law and philosophy at a Bavarian university,

00:01:57.983 --> 00:02:02.863
the University of Ingolstadt, and was the only non-clerical professor,

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:08.323
the only professor who wasn’t also ordained by the Catholic church.

00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:14.323
In the 18th century, Bavaria was still very Catholic, very

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:18.863
conservative, not the kind of place that was open to new ideas.

00:02:19.803 --> 00:02:24.033
Elsewhere in Europe, the Enlightenment had been flourishing.

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:31.903
From new ideas around the role of religion and philosophy to an advanced understanding of

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:38.213
scientific and mathematical concepts, new ideas had been circulating throughout Europe.

00:02:39.173 --> 00:02:46.783
From Francis Bacon to Immanuel Kant, Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Adam Smith, Voltaire to

00:02:47.893 --> 00:02:53.083
Diderot, these are names that we continue to refer back to today, and have had a huge

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:59.773
impact on a lot of modern philosophers, mathematicians, economists, and general thinkers.

00:03:00.872 --> 00:03:06.533
But in 18th century Bavaria, Enlightenment thinking wasn’t encouraged.

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:12.083
It was considered dangerous, heretical even, something to be avoided.

00:03:13.603 --> 00:03:18.573
Unknown to his colleagues, Adam Weishaupt, our law professor, had been

00:03:18.743 --> 00:03:24.093
devouring the works of Enlightenment thinkers as a boy, and continued to

00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:29.533
be fascinated by them as a young professor at the University of Ingolstadt.

00:03:30.307 --> 00:03:37.274
He wasn’t able to discuss these ideas openly, but was a fierce believer that everyone

00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:43.074
should have an Enlightenment understanding of philosophy, mathematics, and reason.

00:03:44.644 --> 00:03:51.174
With nobody to discuss these ideas with, and nobody with whom to have the kind of

00:03:51.174 --> 00:03:56.284
conversations that other Enlightenment thinkers were having in the coffee houses

00:03:56.304 --> 00:04:02.597
of Paris or Oxford, Weishaupt realised he would have to join a secret society.

00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:06.247
Now, secret societies were nothing new.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:11.297
The largest and most well-known one, which you could say

00:04:11.377 --> 00:04:15.195
doesn’t make it that secret, it was called The Freemasons.

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:21.645
But when Weishaupt approached The Freemasons, he firstly found that they

00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:27.655
weren’t as serious as he had hoped, and on a more practical note, it was very

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:32.155
expensive to become a member, and he simply didn’t have the money to do so.

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:38.105
So what do you do when you can’t find a secret society that you want to join?

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:39.775
You make your own one.

00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:45.955
In May 1776, Weishaupt formed his own, secret society.

00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:52.335
It wasn’t called The Illuminati; it was called Bund der Perfektibilisten,

00:04:52.705 --> 00:04:57.165
or Covenant of Perfectibility, or for short, The Perfectibilists.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:02.101
You might think this name is a bit weird, and Weishaupt did

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:06.241
too, which is why he later changed it to The Illuminati.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:15.791
In any case, on the first of May, 1776, Weishaupt got together with 4 students from his university.

00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:21.481
As you might expect with a secret society, they met in secret, in a

00:05:21.481 --> 00:05:26.621
dark forest outside the town of Ingolstadt, and carried large torches.

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:32.615
There and then they decided their own rules and customs.

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:38.545
Their symbol was to be the owl of Minerva, a little owl who in

00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:43.125
Greek and Roman myths would accompany the Goddess of Wisdom.

00:05:44.395 --> 00:05:48.285
Each new member would need to come from a reputable family,

00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:53.754
and be wealthy, but membership was a lot more select than this.

00:05:54.773 --> 00:05:59.801
Every new member would need to be formally approved by every current member.

00:06:00.602 --> 00:06:06.982
Weishaupt was 28 at the time he formed the Illuminati, which may explain the next rule.

00:06:07.765 --> 00:06:10.907
Every new member had to be under 30 years old.

00:06:12.457 --> 00:06:19.307
The reason for this was apparently that if you were over 30 you were too set in your

00:06:19.307 --> 00:06:25.347
ways, you wouldn’t be receptive to the kind of new, Enlightenment ideas that would be

00:06:25.347 --> 00:06:30.967
discussed by other members of the Illuminati, and so sorry, you couldn’t become a member.

00:06:32.617 --> 00:06:39.902
The society had three different levels: Novice, Minerval, and Illuminated Minerval.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.909
You started as a ‘Novice’, and then could get promoted by

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:48.799
doing things like recruiting other people to join the society.

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:53.929
As a Novice, you wouldn't know who the other members of

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:57.849
the society were, you just knew your immediate superior.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:05.603
This was one of the things that helped keep everyone’s identities secret, so if one Novice was

00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:11.168
discovered, that person couldn't reveal the names of all the other members of The Illuminati.

00:07:14.573 --> 00:07:17.253
Further to this, every member had a codename, a secret name.

00:07:18.053 --> 00:07:25.513
Weishaupt’s was Brother Spartacus, the famous Roman leader of the slave rebellion of 73 BC.

00:07:26.993 --> 00:07:31.583
Each member was tasked with recruiting other, reputable

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:35.143
candidates to be members, in order to grow the society.

00:07:36.653 --> 00:07:40.913
But for the first couple of years, it grew pretty slowly,

00:07:41.453 --> 00:07:47.693
only going from 4 to 12 people between 1776 and 1778.

00:07:49.293 --> 00:07:55.453
In order to try to recruit more members, and build up the organisation, but also to

00:07:55.453 --> 00:08:02.193
see how a secret society worked from within, Weishaupt decided to become a member

00:08:02.303 --> 00:08:08.093
of the Freemasons, the most famous and established secret society of the time.

00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:11.095
He did this in 1777.

00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:16.705
After he was accepted into the Freemasons, he started to

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:21.273
recruit people to join his own secret society, The Illuminati.

00:08:22.513 --> 00:08:28.543
These new recruits would also recruit other Freemasons, and there was quickly

00:08:28.603 --> 00:08:34.463
a pretty thin line between who was a Freemason and who was in the Illuminati.

00:08:35.973 --> 00:08:40.843
The number of Illuminati members grew, and they spread geographically

00:08:40.913 --> 00:08:45.503
from their original base in Bavaria to large parts of Western Europe.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.460
But as the society was secret, and consisted of lots of different,

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:57.350
geographically separated cells, keeping everyone unified was difficult.

00:08:58.186 --> 00:09:04.733
The very nature of the Illuminati meant that internal divisions arose, and there was

00:09:04.733 --> 00:09:10.993
quite a lot of infighting, fighting between different members and different factions.

00:09:12.573 --> 00:09:20.193
Several prominent members of the Illuminati left the society on bad terms, and one, an

00:09:20.213 --> 00:09:26.843
ex-member called Joseph Utzschneider wrote to the Grand Duchess of Bavaria with a series

00:09:26.863 --> 00:09:34.183
of revelations about the Illuminati, a sort of 18th century ‘exposé’ of the organisation.

00:09:35.884 --> 00:09:42.924
In his letter he claimed that the Illuminati believed that suicide was legitimate, that

00:09:43.034 --> 00:09:51.034
religion was an absurdity, and that the Illuminati were conspiring with Austria against Bavaria.

00:09:51.044 --> 00:10:00.524
The Duchess immediately told the Duke, her husband, and between 1785 and 1787

00:10:02.074 --> 00:10:08.214
he imposed a series of punishments on secret societies and on the Illuminati,

00:10:08.814 --> 00:10:14.534
starting with just fines, financial punishments for being a member, and

00:10:14.534 --> 00:10:21.774
then in 1787, making membership of The Illuminati punishable by death.

00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:29.974
Understandably, being part of the Illuminati lost some of its allure, it became

00:10:30.234 --> 00:10:34.854
slightly less attractive if you could be killed just for going to a meeting.

00:10:36.364 --> 00:10:39.814
Weishaupt, the original leader of the Illuminati

00:10:39.974 --> 00:10:44.384
fled, and the organisation disbanded, it fell apart.

00:10:45.794 --> 00:10:50.634
Historians are divided over how many members the Illuminati ever

00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:58.374
had at its peak, and estimates range from around 650 to 2000.

00:10:59.874 --> 00:11:05.874
The fact that it was a secret society, and there was no central record, obviously

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:11.684
makes finding the true number hard, but it was a lot smaller than most people think.

00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:19.864
So, it was founded on May 1st 1776, and disbanded, at least most reputable

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:25.994
historians believe it was disbanded, in around 1785, just 9 years later.

00:11:27.564 --> 00:11:31.604
But if that is the case, you might be asking yourself, why

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:35.854
do people still think the Illuminati control the world today?

00:11:37.284 --> 00:11:42.614
Well, if you believe in the conspiracy theory of the Illuminati, then you would probably

00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:48.044
say that the order never died, and it continued to go from strength to strength,

00:11:48.354 --> 00:11:53.054
and any historian who says otherwise just doesn’t know what they are talking about.

00:11:54.294 --> 00:11:59.454
But there is another view, a more conventional, evidence-based view.

00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:04.864
After the Illuminati disbanded in the late 18th century, there wasn’t

00:12:04.874 --> 00:12:09.539
really much talk of them anywhere in the world for almost 200 years.

00:12:10.349 --> 00:12:12.519
People weren’t even discussing them.

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:18.389
They had gone, disappeared, all the original members had died, and there were no new members.

00:12:19.859 --> 00:12:28.289
Then, in the 1960s, in the freewheeling, anti-authority years, a book came out that was to prove

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:35.659
to be instrumental, albeit indirectly, in the resurrection of the Illuminati in popular culture.

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:44.749
It was called Principia Discordia, and talked about a parody of a religion, called Discordianism.

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:51.176
In the book, believers in Discordianism were called on to

00:12:51.176 --> 00:12:56.866
worship the goddess of Chaos, and to essentially cause chaos.

00:12:58.046 --> 00:13:04.176
The idea was that the world was becoming too uptight, too authoritarian,

00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:10.016
and causing chaos would be one way of bringing about social change.

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:17.104
One man, an American called Robert Anton Wilson, did exactly that.

00:13:18.264 --> 00:13:22.884
He was an editor for Playboy magazine at the time, and

00:13:23.134 --> 00:13:27.054
his job involved responding to letters from readers.

00:13:28.264 --> 00:13:31.470
He started to write fake letters, pretending to be a

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:38.584
reader, and then he would respond to these letters.

00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:42.654
These letters talked about this group called The Illuminati,

00:13:43.134 --> 00:13:47.334
saying that they controlled everything that went on in the world.

00:13:48.714 --> 00:13:55.734
To sow more chaos, he would also send more letters in, that would take an opposing viewpoint.

00:13:56.644 --> 00:14:01.524
The idea was to get people thinking, questioning their idea

00:14:01.584 --> 00:14:06.454
of reality, and sowing the conspiracy of The Illuminati.

00:14:07.984 --> 00:14:12.364
He then, together with a colleague, turned these letters into a book,

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:18.008
called The Illuminatus Trilogy, where he claimed that The Illuminati were

00:14:18.008 --> 00:14:24.258
this global elite, and were responsible for things like the murder of JFK.

00:14:25.718 --> 00:14:30.078
It became a cult book, it was turned into a play, and has

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:34.578
had a huge influence on writers, artists, and musicians.

00:14:35.548 --> 00:14:40.018
But what it really did is bring the Illuminati back into

00:14:40.018 --> 00:14:44.548
people’s minds, and get people questioning their own reality.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:51.572
Even though it was meant to be a fantasy book, this idea that the

00:14:51.582 --> 00:14:56.802
Illuminati is still very much alive, and that there is a secret society

00:14:56.802 --> 00:15:01.872
that controls pretty much everything we do, is certainly alluring.

00:15:03.352 --> 00:15:08.642
As with almost every conspiracy theory, it’s hard to prove that something doesn’t

00:15:08.652 --> 00:15:14.832
exist, especially if it’s the most secret, most powerful society in the world.

00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:19.852
Of course you and I don’t know about the Illuminati - why would we?

00:15:20.152 --> 00:15:22.622
We are mere normal citizens.

00:15:24.092 --> 00:15:30.072
Perhaps the modern-day equivalent of The Illuminatus Trilogy is Angels and Demons,

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:35.602
the book by Dan Brown that came out in 2000 and was all about The Illuminati.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:43.380
Although this book didn’t claim to be anything other than fiction, it reignited the

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.985
public interest in the order, and conspiracy theorists are now on the lookout for

00:15:49.325 --> 00:15:55.505
any sign of anything that might indicate that someone is a member of the Illuminati.

00:15:57.085 --> 00:16:05.025
Given that the supposed symbols of the Illuminati include a triangle and an eye, these things

00:16:05.025 --> 00:16:12.087
crop up quite a lot, they exist a lot in our day to day lives, so understandably, if you want

00:16:12.097 --> 00:16:18.597
to see signs of the Illuminati, then you will probably see them in much of modern day life.

00:16:20.077 --> 00:16:26.347
Jay Z and Beyonce, for example, are believed by some to be modern-day Illuminati members.

00:16:27.227 --> 00:16:32.737
Both Jay Z and Beyonce often make a sort of diamond sign with their fingers

00:16:32.757 --> 00:16:38.807
on stage, which according to them is just a sign of Jay Z’s record label, but

00:16:39.067 --> 00:16:44.357
according to conspiracy theorists is a sign that they are both Illuminati members.

00:16:45.617 --> 00:16:50.727
For some people, the fact that millions of people listen to their music and go to their

00:16:50.727 --> 00:16:57.257
shows doesn’t seem to be enough of an explanation of their wealth and success - instead,

00:16:57.447 --> 00:17:02.814
they must be members of The Illuminati, and the fact that they make this sign proves it.

00:17:04.324 --> 00:17:10.454
And belief, or at least interest, in the Illuminati seems to have never been higher.

00:17:11.254 --> 00:17:17.514
Videos about how the Illuminati is real have racked up hundreds of millions of

00:17:17.514 --> 00:17:23.714
views on YouTube, Illuminati conspiracy theory pages and groups have hundreds of

00:17:23.714 --> 00:17:30.187
thousands of members on Facebook, and it seems that this theory isn’t going anywhere.

00:17:31.647 --> 00:17:37.807
So, interestingly enough, while Adam Weishaupt, the founder of The Illuminati, the man who

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:45.407
started it all in a forest outside Ingolstadt in 1776, wasn’t ever able to conquer the world

00:17:45.427 --> 00:17:51.598
with his ideas while he was alive, and his group never numbered more than a couple of thousand,

00:17:52.298 --> 00:17:59.758
with the arrival of The Internet and new fantasy books, tens, if not hundreds of millions now

00:17:59.928 --> 00:18:06.738
believe that the group he started of just him and 4 students now controls everything we do.

00:18:07.868 --> 00:18:13.648
And I think that if he were alive today, he would find that quite surprising.

00:18:16.768 --> 00:18:21.168
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on The Illuminati.

00:18:21.558 --> 00:18:24.558
I hope you have found it interesting - I was going to do a terrible

00:18:24.568 --> 00:18:28.008
joke about finding it illuminating, but I’ll save you that one.

00:18:28.878 --> 00:18:33.353
As always, I would love to know what you thought of today's episode.

00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:38.668
Soon we are going to be launching a smart new forum for you to discuss episodes, so

00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:44.148
that will be the place to chat with like minded people, but in the meantime, it's me.

00:18:44.298 --> 00:18:45.968
So I would love to know what you think.

00:18:46.218 --> 00:18:49.678

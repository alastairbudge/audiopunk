Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:15.673
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:19.543
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:23.793
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it’s part two of our mini-series

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:28.003
on the quest to find the true origin of the river Nile.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:32.403
In this episode, we will be following the adventures of another man,

00:00:32.703 --> 00:00:36.753
or perhaps the “mission” of another man is a better way of putting it.

00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:43.033
His name was Dr David Livingstone, and his story doesn’t involve beetles getting

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:48.733
stuck in his ear, but it does involve some disease, slavery, exploration,

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:54.343
Christianity, and, of course, the ongoing search for the origin of the river Nile.

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:59.753
And a quick admin point: just in case you haven’t listened to it yet, I’d highly

00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:05.193
recommend listening to part one before this episode, as we’ll be picking up the story

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:09.973
from then, and everything will make a lot more sense if you’ve listened to part one.

00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:16.003
OK then, Dr Livingstone and the quest to find the origin of the Nile

00:01:17.363 --> 00:01:22.573
If you remember from our last episode, we had learned about one of the most intense

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:29.273
rivalries in British exploration, that between Sir Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke.

00:01:30.463 --> 00:01:36.913
Our story ended as the pair were scheduled to debate the true origin of the White Nile,

00:01:37.373 --> 00:01:43.783
with Burton proposing that it was Lake Tanganyika and Speke claiming it was Lake Victoria.

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:51.293
The debate never happened, as Speke was found dead by his own shotgun the afternoon before.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:56.843
And the public was none the wiser, the answer to the

00:01:56.843 --> 00:02:00.743
question of the origin of The Nile was still unsolved.

00:02:01.963 --> 00:02:07.203
Just two years later, another British explorer decided to take his shot.

00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:11.803
But this man was very different from Burton and Speke.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:17.243
He was not an aristocrat, not a soldier, and he wasn’t even English.

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:23.703
He was a Scottish doctor from a working-class background called David Livingstone.

00:02:25.293 --> 00:02:28.243
He had been in Africa for most of his adult life,

00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:33.333
arriving in the continent in 1841 at the age of 28.

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:38.643
He had gone to Africa not for personal gain or out of

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:42.363
a sense of adventure, but for two interlinked reasons.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:48.053
He went as a Christian missionary, to convert people to the world of God.

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:52.983
The reason for this was partially for “traditional”

00:02:53.193 --> 00:02:55.993
missionary reasons, to spread the word of Christianity.

00:02:56.723 --> 00:03:00.773
But he was also a fervent believer in the horrors of

00:03:00.863 --> 00:03:04.923
slavery, referring to it as “the curse of Africa”.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:12.703
He first travelled to Africa because he believed that spreading the word of God and converting

00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:18.873
people to Christianity would be the most effective thing he could do to stop the slave trade.

00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:27.103
Now, he was actually a terrible missionary, and there is only evidence of one person that he

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:32.553
personally converted, and that person went on to convert many more people than Livingstone did.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:40.793
But he was an excellent explorer, and made a series of expeditions northwards from South Africa.

00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:46.353
This exploration turned out to be not only exploration for

00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:50.443
exploration’s sake; there was an ulterior motive for doing it.

00:03:51.843 --> 00:03:55.123
Livingstone realised that the interior of southern

00:03:55.123 --> 00:03:59.763
Africa was connected by a large variety of rivers.

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:07.483
He hypothesised that if he could map these rivers, and show Europeans how they

00:04:07.483 --> 00:04:12.793
could sail up these rivers and trade with African people, this would be an important

00:04:12.803 --> 00:04:17.763
step towards accomplishing Livingstone’s main goal: to stop the slave trade.

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:23.133
And to clarify, by the time Livingstone had arrived

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:26.751
in Africa, the Atlantic slave trade was all but over.

00:04:27.403 --> 00:04:31.613
The United States had made it illegal to import slaves in 1808.

00:04:32.993 --> 00:04:37.733
The slave trade Livingstone was focussed on was the Arab slave trade,

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:43.553
where African people were captured or sold into slavery to Arab traders,

00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:47.733
who would then transport them typically to India or the Middle East.

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:51.953
Now, why is this relevant in the context of Livingstone?

00:04:52.573 --> 00:04:58.863
Well, the African people who were sold into slavery were often sold by other Africans.

00:04:59.943 --> 00:05:05.823
Livingstone saw that much of the African continent that he travelled to was very rich in

00:05:05.823 --> 00:05:11.563
natural resources, there were plenty of things that could be traded - woods, ivory, and so on.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:19.513
But what was traded were slaves, because the Arab slave traders were the main group of foreigners

00:05:19.693 --> 00:05:26.693
who would travel any real distance from the coast, and they only really wanted one thing: slaves.

00:05:27.523 --> 00:05:31.613
So, Livingstone thought that the most important thing he could

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:35.933
do to stop the slave trade was to open up other forms of trade.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:42.513
Indeed, his motto, and the words that are etched onto a statue of him

00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:48.533
at the Victoria Falls, are "Christianity, Commerce and Civilization"

00:05:50.073 --> 00:05:55.513
So, much of his early time in Africa was spent exploring African rivers.

00:05:56.273 --> 00:06:00.813
He became the first European to go all the way up and down the Zambezi

00:06:00.813 --> 00:06:05.123
river, Africa’s fourth longest river, and the one that runs through

00:06:05.123 --> 00:06:09.193
modern Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:17.233
On his return to the UK, in 1856, he found that he was something of a celebrity.

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:24.583
He was made a fellow of the Royal Society, granted an audience with Queen Victoria, and was

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:31.593
essentially the country’s most famous explorer, and the foremost expert on all things Africa.

00:06:33.123 --> 00:06:36.883
After finding that his fame meant it was easy to raise funds for

00:06:36.883 --> 00:06:40.813
another expedition, he returned to Africa a couple of years later.

00:06:41.963 --> 00:06:46.123
But it seems that the fame had somewhat got to his head.

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:50.563
He started to believe that he was on some form of divine mission,

00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:54.893
led by God, and would not listen to anyone else’s advice.

00:06:56.233 --> 00:07:00.543
His team members on this second expedition reported that he was an

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:05.633
ineffective leader, he was abandoned by many of his men, this expedition

00:07:05.803 --> 00:07:10.033
was a failure, and Livingstone’s credibility took a bit of a dent.

00:07:11.443 --> 00:07:17.133
But still, his “mission”, in the grand sense, was far from complete.

00:07:17.983 --> 00:07:22.203
He had barely converted anyone, and hundreds of thousands of men,

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:26.783
women and children were still being sold into slavery every year.

00:07:27.893 --> 00:07:31.983
Livingstone needed to go back; he longed to return to Africa.

00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:36.923
But after the failure of his previous mission, he didn’t find that

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:42.363
people were so eager to cough up, to finance, another similar expedition.

00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:47.081
He needed to find a popular cause for which he could raise

00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:51.001
money, something that he knew he could get financial support for.

00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:56.431
The answer was right in front of his eyes: the ongoing

00:07:56.691 --> 00:08:00.531
unsolved question of the true origin of the Nile.

00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:07.441
Now, initially at least, Livingstone was pretty uninterested in the true source of the

00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:13.161
Nile, but he believed that if he could “solve” this mystery, then it would help him

00:08:13.351 --> 00:08:19.111
rebuild his credibility, and further his quest to end the East African slave trade.

00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:27.761
He managed to raise enough money, £2,000, which is around €250,000 in today’s money.

00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:32.391
Given the size of the voyage ahead of him, it was a

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.121
very modest amount, but it was enough to get started.

00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:43.611
He set out in 1866 on a mission that was supposed to be two years long.

00:08:45.271 --> 00:08:48.811
Like Burton and Speke before him, he set off from

00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:52.641
Zanzibar with a team of mainly freed slaves and servants.

00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:56.971
And the journey would take him through modern Tanzania,

00:08:57.341 --> 00:09:01.531
Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:08.164
His journey was, in many ways, even more arduous than his predecessors.

00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:15.651
He was robbed multiple times and within a few months practically all his supplies were gone.

00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:19.511
He got malaria a total of 26 times.

00:09:20.081 --> 00:09:25.381
He fell incredibly ill, and with his medicines gone, it looked like

00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:29.891
he would be lucky even to live two years, let alone get home alive.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.821
He was forced to seek help from the very people he

00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:38.711
despised and had fought against, the Arab slave traders.

00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:46.271
In what must have been a difficult and confusing experience, his life was saved by slave

00:09:46.271 --> 00:09:51.861
traders, he lived with the slave traders, and developed a friendly relationship with them.

00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:56.971
On the one hand, these slave traders looked after him,

00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:01.721
gave him medicine, fed him, and ultimately saved his life.

00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:08.611
On the other hand, he knew exactly what they were, merchants of human flesh.

00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:15.941
And in one horrific incident, he received a shocking reminder of the true

00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:20.001
character of the men who had looked after him, when he saw slave traders

00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:25.281
massacring a group of 400 Africans, mainly women, right in front of him.

00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:31.331
In fact, this incident was so brutal that it even surpassed

00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:35.041
Livingstone’s expectations about what the slave traders were capable of.

00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:41.811
He had seen the inhumanity of the slave trade upfront for 30 years, but the

00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:47.101
fact that literally hundreds of people could be murdered in cold blood, this

00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:51.541
would alter his perception of the deep injustice of the slave trade forever.

00:10:53.131 --> 00:11:01.531
This was in 1871, and by this time his location was completely unknown to the outside world.

00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:08.441
Indeed, shortly after he had started his journey, several of his assistants

00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:14.158
had deserted him, returned to Zanzibar and told everyone that he was dead.

00:11:15.728 --> 00:11:18.868
He had written letters home, or at least, sent letters

00:11:18.918 --> 00:11:23.258
to Zanzibar, but only one out of 44 made it there.

00:11:24.768 --> 00:11:31.108
In one that was only recently made public, he wrote to an anti-slavery campaigner in Zanzibar saying

00:11:31.988 --> 00:11:38.098
"I am terribly knocked up but this is for your own eye only, doubtful if I live to see you again."

00:11:39.828 --> 00:11:46.078
Now, as a quick language point, you might have heard “knocked up” being used to mean pregnant.

00:11:46.558 --> 00:11:49.438
Obviously that’s not what it means here; it’s a slightly

00:11:49.478 --> 00:11:53.368
old expression, but it means exhausted, very tired.

00:11:54.918 --> 00:11:59.018
And in the case of Livingstone, it is something of a euphemism.

00:12:00.568 --> 00:12:03.438
By this time, he was at death’s door.

00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:10.108
He had had cholera, pneumonia, and as you heard, he had malaria 26 times, as well as a

00:12:10.108 --> 00:12:16.768
whole host of other tropical diseases, and all of his money, food and supplies had run out.

00:12:17.818 --> 00:12:23.288
He had even run out of paper, so was keeping a diary by writing on an old

00:12:23.288 --> 00:12:28.218
copy of a British newspaper that he had cut up into 32 different “pages”.

00:12:29.698 --> 00:12:33.258
He had made some progress with the stated mission of the

00:12:33.258 --> 00:12:36.648
expedition, to find the true source of the river Nile.

00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:42.148
He had located several rivers and lakes, but realised

00:12:42.298 --> 00:12:45.868
that none of them solved the mystery of the river Nile.

00:12:47.448 --> 00:12:49.388
Nobody knew about this, of course.

00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:54.998
To the outside world, he was dead, or at least he had completely disappeared.

00:12:56.628 --> 00:13:00.958
And to underline, to remind you, he was a household name, he

00:13:00.958 --> 00:13:04.978
was famous, he was one of the world’s most famous explorers.

00:13:05.608 --> 00:13:11.198
His mission had been widely publicised, and he had completely disappeared.

00:13:12.768 --> 00:13:19.728
Then, an American newspaper, the New York Herald, decided to take on the challenge of finding him.

00:13:20.818 --> 00:13:25.948
Or rather, a Welsh-American journalist called Henry Morton Stanley had pitched

00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:30.488
the owner of the newspaper on the project, saying “let me go and look for him.

00:13:30.758 --> 00:13:35.218
I know the probability of me returning alive is slim, but if I can

00:13:35.218 --> 00:13:39.638
return with news of Livingstone, it will be the most amazing story”.

00:13:41.078 --> 00:13:48.068
The paper agreed, and in 1869 the then 26-year-old Stanley set

00:13:48.118 --> 00:13:51.815
off with the challenge of finding the famous Dr Livingstone.

00:13:53.118 --> 00:13:59.128
Now, this individual, the young Henry Morton Stanley, is a fascinating and complicated

00:13:59.128 --> 00:14:04.638
character, and he will be the focus of our next episode, but let me give you some

00:14:04.658 --> 00:14:10.638
background to the man, which might help you understand him in the context of Dr Livingstone.

00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:18.486
Stanley’s mother had him when she was only 18 years old, then abandoned him shortly after birth.

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:24.006
He had been sent to live with relatives, but was then completely abandoned

00:14:24.016 --> 00:14:29.586
by his family and sent to a workhouse, a place for abandoned children.

00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:36.091
As you might imagine, this experience was horrific, he was forced to

00:14:36.091 --> 00:14:40.541
work from dawn to dusk, he was sexually abused, it was just terrible.

00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:46.721
When he was 18, he boarded a ship for America, seeking

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:50.301
to reinvent himself in a country full of opportunities.

00:14:51.551 --> 00:14:55.741
He fought in the civil war, realised he had quite the talent for

00:14:55.741 --> 00:15:01.211
journalism, and carved out a path for himself as a freelance journalist.

00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:07.731
And when he was briefly in London, he read about the story of Dr David

00:15:07.741 --> 00:15:11.961
Livingstone, the world’s most famous explorer, lost in the heart of

00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:16.911
Africa, and he decided that he would make it his mission to find him.

00:15:18.311 --> 00:15:24.111
After all, he had had an awful life up to this point, he had literally been disowned

00:15:24.121 --> 00:15:29.891
by his family as a child, and he had nothing to lose; this was his big chance.

00:15:31.371 --> 00:15:36.511
Of course, he knew the dangers of the mission, and its low probability of success.

00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:39.341
Livingstone was probably dead.

00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:45.761
Even if he was alive, Stanley only had a rough idea of where Livingstone might be.

00:15:46.841 --> 00:15:50.911
And there were all the standard complications of an expedition into

00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:56.361
completely unknown territory: disease, getting lost, and of course finding

00:15:56.361 --> 00:16:00.201
people who were not best pleased that you have intruded on their land.

00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:06.601
But on another level, Livingstone was a white man from Scotland.

00:16:07.101 --> 00:16:11.491
If he was alive, he would be the only white man in hundreds of kilometres.

00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:15.081
Someone would know something about where he was.

00:16:16.611 --> 00:16:18.871
And Stanley would stop at nothing.

00:16:20.011 --> 00:16:22.891
Indeed, one of his diary entries read:

00:16:23.851 --> 00:16:28.811
“I have taken a solemn, enduring oath, an oath to be kept while the least hope

00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:33.571
of life remains in me, not to be tempted to break the resolution I have formed,

00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:39.141
never to give up the search, until I find Livingstone alive, or find his dead

00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:45.151
body....No living man, or living men, shall stop me, only death can prevent me.

00:16:45.641 --> 00:16:51.171
But death—not even this; I shall not die, I will not die, I cannot die!”

00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:59.691
On November 10th, 1871, Stanley arrived at the town of Ujiji on the banks of Lake

00:16:59.741 --> 00:17:05.801
Tanganyika and did indeed find a man who looked a little different from everyone else.

00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:12.401
He greeted him, so the legend goes at least, the way a Victorian gentleman

00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:18.441
might greet another at a fashionable social event, “Dr Livingstone, I presume?”

00:17:19.961 --> 00:17:25.261
He had presumed correctly, and finally Dr Livingstone had been located.

00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:30.861
But, if Stanley had thought that Livingstone would have been overjoyed to

00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:35.861
see him and have got on the first ship back to Britain, he was much mistaken.

00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:41.011
Livingstone still had work to do, and refused to leave.

00:17:42.511 --> 00:17:47.014
Surprisingly, perhaps, Dr Livingstone and Henry Morton

00:17:47.014 --> 00:17:51.374
Stanley struck up a close bond and became good friends.

00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:57.325
Livingstone was 58 when the pair met, while Stanley was 30.

00:17:58.897 --> 00:18:03.404
Livingstone would write to friends saying that Stanley was like a son to him,

00:18:04.194 --> 00:18:09.354
and Stanley would write that the doctor nursed him like a father when he was ill.

00:18:11.164 --> 00:18:14.294
The pair parted ways, with Stanley returning to the

00:18:14.294 --> 00:18:18.074
United States, and Livingstone refusing to leave Africa.

00:18:19.144 --> 00:18:21.604
After all, he still had work to do.

00:18:23.404 --> 00:18:28.314
Unfortunately, it wasn’t to be, and the then 60-year-old Livingstone

00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:34.284
died 18 months later in modern-day Zambia from malaria and dysentery.

00:18:35.794 --> 00:18:39.204
So, what did this perhaps unlikely pair get up to?

00:18:39.724 --> 00:18:42.694
What was their contribution to the discovery of The Nile?

00:18:44.164 --> 00:18:49.744
After the famous meeting, Livingstone and Stanley explored the rest of Lake Tanganyika,

00:18:50.284 --> 00:18:55.154
which you might remember was what Sir Richard Burton believed to be the source of The Nile.

00:18:56.634 --> 00:19:01.934
They found one river that could potentially lead to the river Nile, on the west side

00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:07.644
of the lake, but they were unable to say definitively whether it was or it wasn’t.

00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:13.684
And in terms of the contribution that Dr Livingstone made towards the holy

00:19:13.684 --> 00:19:18.944
grail of the true source of the White Nile, it was both important and limited.

00:19:20.074 --> 00:19:23.214
He did succeed in charting large parts of southern

00:19:23.214 --> 00:19:27.414
Africa that had been, until then, unmapped by Europeans.

00:19:27.944 --> 00:19:33.674
So, he eliminated some possibilities, which was of course helpful, but not conclusive.

00:19:34.644 --> 00:19:39.544
And, of course, he died before he was ever able to complete this research.

00:19:40.364 --> 00:19:44.104
It would take the man he had treated like a son, Henry

00:19:44.104 --> 00:19:47.704
Morton Stanley, to solve the problem once and for all.

00:19:48.264 --> 00:19:52.944
And that, my fellow explorers, is the story that we’ll tell in part three.

00:19:55.542 --> 00:19:58.972
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Dr Livingstone

00:19:59.182 --> 00:20:01.862
and his attempts to find the origin of The White Nile.

00:20:02.392 --> 00:20:05.882
Stay tuned for part three, as we will be hearing about the amazing

00:20:05.912 --> 00:20:10.042
final chapter of this story, with the big reveal of where The Nile

00:20:10.062 --> 00:20:13.802
actually comes from, as well as reflecting on this quest more widely.

00:20:14.972 --> 00:20:19.182
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:19.582 --> 00:20:24.402
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the first, the inaugural, members-only English

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.670
Learning for Curious Minds podcast.

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:18.668
Let me just start by saying a big thank you for your ongoing membership.

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:26.196
The podcast wouldn't be possible without your support and every one of you is the reason that I do

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:26.766
the show.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:36.186
I guess that most of you should know who I am by now, but just in case you need a reminder, I'm

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:37.236
Alastair Budge.

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:41.916
I'm the host of the podcast and the founder of Leonardo English.

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:50.406
Today we are going to talk about something that I think is pretty important when learning English,

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:56.193
or any language for that matter, but that a lot of people don't fully appreciate.

00:00:57.376 --> 00:01:00.084
And that thing is the dictionary.

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:08.904
Today it is time to talk about how to use a dictionary properly as part of your English learning

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:09.474
toolkit.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.811
And this isn't just going to be a list of the best dictionaries where afterwards you can go away

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:22.191
with a shopping list of dictionaries to buy or apps to download.

00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:25.671
But I will give you a few hints on that front.

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.381
Oh no.

00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:32.181
Today we are going to talk about how to use a dictionary properly.

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:37.021
On one level you might think it's pretty self-explanatory.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:44.211
You look up the meanings of words you don't know and that you can't figure out through context and

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:51.351
whether it's a huge, big paper one that you have sitting on your desk, a mini one that you keep in

00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:57.981
your pocket if you're out and about, if it's an app on your phone or even Google Translate, the

00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:00.831
purpose of a dictionary is pretty simple.

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:09.561
It tells you the meanings of words, and yes, of course at a basic level, this is correct.

00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:18.261
But this would be like looking at one of the cars used in a James Bond film and thinking, well, it's

00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.891
probably quite a good car to go and get some shopping in.

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:30.036
Yes, of course it can do that, but if you think of it purely in these terms, then you're missing out

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:36.966
on a huge amount that will really help you get the most out of using a dictionary and help you

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:44.346
increase your vocabulary, be a more effective learner, and ultimately improve your English faster

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:45.996
than you might do otherwise.

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:54.830
So firstly, let's look at the different types of dictionaries that you can use, as this is actually

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.020
quite an important choice for you to make.

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:03.745
When learning English, or when learning any language really, you can choose either a monolingual

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.295
dictionary or a bilingual dictionary.

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:15.295
In case you don't know what those words mean, a monolingual dictionary means that the meaning of an

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:21.805
English word will be explained in English, while with a bilingual dictionary, the meaning will be

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:24.955
explained in another language, in your mother tongue.

00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:34.091
For beginners and for anyone who is up to about an intermediate level, a bilingual dictionary is

00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:35.501
normally preferred.

00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:42.531
This is because with a monolingual dictionary, if you can't understand the words in the definition,

00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:45.891
well, life is going to be pretty difficult.

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:53.746
Good monolingual dictionaries should always use simple words in the explanation of a more

00:03:53.746 --> 00:04:00.046
complicated word, but even though they do this, it'll always be harder than if there was a

00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:02.596
translation given in your mother tongue.

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:11.496
But for language learners of intermediate level and above, both bilingual and monolingual

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:12.996
dictionaries can be used.

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:16.056
And it just depends on personal preference.

00:04:16.662 --> 00:04:23.256
All of you, I believe, should be at an intermediate level and above, and so you can choose which one

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:23.826
you prefer.

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:32.961
Now there are different views on this, and once people decide that they prefer one particular type,

00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:35.511
it's normally quite hard to change their mind.

00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:45.171
People are pretty stuck in their ways and internet forums are full of people arguing one way or the

00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:45.531
other.

00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:52.791
Monolingual dictionaries are normally preferred in academic institutions such as university.

00:04:53.357 --> 00:04:59.230
When I was at university, for example, studying French and Italian, we were forced to use

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.550
monolingual dictionaries.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.130
The reason for this is that as we are already at a decent enough level to learn new vocabulary in

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:17.500
context, and the theory was that we should be exposed to as much of the target languages as

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:26.530
possible, that we should be thinking, writing, reading, dreaming in that language in a real state of

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.460
total immersion.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.440
So that was why we were made to use monolingual dictionaries.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:40.210
But there are those that say that they really don't like monolingual dictionaries, saying that they

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.935
make the process of finding the meaning of a word much harder and more time-consuming, and what this

00:05:47.935 --> 00:05:54.955
does is it distracts from the flow of reading or listening in the target language.

00:05:56.181 --> 00:06:03.140
Steve Kaufman, the famous polyglot and founder of thelinguist.com says that he finds that

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:09.940
monolingual dictionaries slow him down, and therefore in the long run they reduce the amount of

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.860
exposure he has to what he calls meaningful content.

00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:24.975
So his view is that monolingual dictionaries are less efficient and actually that the net effect on

00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:27.495
language learning is negative.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.360
So he doesn't like them at all, and he prefers a bilingual dictionary.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:40.664
This podcast could go on for hours, days, even if I went through all of the arguments for and

00:06:40.664 --> 00:06:47.504
against bilingual or monolingual dictionaries, and at the end of the day, it just depends on what

00:06:47.504 --> 00:06:48.914
you're most comfortable with.

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:53.309
It also doesn't have to be an either or situation.

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:01.709
You can use both, and given that there are so many fantastic free dictionaries available online, you

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:03.299
will find out what works for you.

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:12.757
All of the definitions in the key vocabulary for the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast, as

00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:20.167
you will know, are given in English, as we want to be an intensive English only resource.

00:07:20.737 --> 00:07:26.827
However, of course, you can make up your own list in your own language or look up any word in a

00:07:26.827 --> 00:07:32.527
bilingual dictionary if the definition provided in English isn't sufficiently clear.

00:07:33.838 --> 00:07:40.811
And naturally as your English level improves and your vocabulary increases, you'll find it easier

00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:44.321
and easier to use a monolingual dictionary if you so choose.

00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:54.701
Okay, so the choice of what type of dictionary to use, either monolingual or bilingual is up to you.

00:07:56.231 --> 00:08:02.921
How you actually use a dictionary though is something that lots of people don't get right, meaning

00:08:02.921 --> 00:08:09.291
that they end up looking up the meaning of a particular word there and then, but then they don't

00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:14.781
really do anything more to try to actually cement that word in their memory.

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:22.931
Meaning that when they come across the word later on, whether that's a day, a week, or a month

00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:26.511
later, they really struggle to recall what it means.

00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:33.711
So what they do is they just look it up, they solve the immediate problem, but there's no long-term

00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:37.701
strategy around how to actually remember that word.

00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:45.010
And this is where a few of the techniques that I'm going to share with you today can really help.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.270
So let's give ourselves a real life example.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:56.422
Let's say I come across the word 'sufficiently', which we actually had thirty seconds back.

00:08:57.757 --> 00:09:04.447
One mistake that people make related to looking up vocabulary in a dictionary is to immediately

00:09:04.447 --> 00:09:10.874
reach for the dictionary as soon as they find a word they don't know, and this is actually a big

00:09:10.874 --> 00:09:11.534
mistake.

00:09:11.924 --> 00:09:18.974
The dictionary should be your last resort only if you can't understand the word through context.

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:26.819
There's a lot of academic research that suggests that you are more likely to remember a word if

00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:33.059
you've understood the definition through context instead of just immediately looking it up in a

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:33.629
dictionary.

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:41.939
So what you should do is wait until the rest of the sentence or just give it a bit more time and

00:09:41.939 --> 00:09:46.109
then you may well be able to understand the meaning of the word contextually.

00:09:47.474 --> 00:09:54.734
Learning to use context to understand words is also a big, big skill in itself, and this probably

00:09:54.734 --> 00:09:58.484
calls for a standalone podcast on the topic.

00:09:59.774 --> 00:10:06.519
You'll know that lots of polyglots and people who are able to speak multiple languages learn

00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:12.549
languages faster than people who can't, and one of the reasons for this is that they are very good

00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:15.069
at understanding meanings contextually.

00:10:16.056 --> 00:10:21.906
And yes, learning to use context to understand words is this huge skill, so I think we will probably

00:10:21.906 --> 00:10:24.396
do a podcast on that later on.

00:10:25.674 --> 00:10:33.573
However, you can't understand everything through context and if you've tried but haven't managed,

00:10:33.993 --> 00:10:36.603
here's where our dictionary comes into play.

00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:45.613
So I could just look up the word in a dictionary, either a monolingual or bilingual one and find out

00:10:45.613 --> 00:10:46.153
the meaning.

00:10:46.783 --> 00:10:48.163
And that's what most people do.

00:10:48.928 --> 00:10:50.788
For most people, it stops there.

00:10:51.298 --> 00:10:58.738
They do nothing more than just solve the problem of not understanding that word there and then and

00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:02.068
they don't do anything more to try and remember the word.

00:11:03.612 --> 00:11:11.172
Just finding the meaning of a word so that you can move on and understand the rest of the article,

00:11:11.172 --> 00:11:17.382
chapter or podcast is an okay strategy if you're just rushing through it.

00:11:17.772 --> 00:11:24.552
But if your objective is to actually continually build your vocabulary and improve your lexicon,

00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:31.272
then there are a few things that you really need to be doing with the dictionary in order to

00:11:31.272 --> 00:11:34.782
maximise your chances of remembering that word.

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:42.008
Assuming that you don't have a photographic memory, then you probably won't be able to recall that

00:11:42.008 --> 00:11:45.998
word that you've just taken the time to look up in a few weeks' time.

00:11:47.048 --> 00:11:50.228
So here are a few things you can do.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:59.032
Firstly, you should write the word down, of course, and write down the definition, either in your

00:11:59.032 --> 00:12:05.092
own language or in English or both, if you're feeling particularly, particularly studious.

00:12:06.432 --> 00:12:12.702
I've said elsewhere that every serious language student needs to have their own little black book,

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:17.712
their own little dictionary, and so you need to be constantly adding new words to it.

00:12:18.952 --> 00:12:24.975
So when you find a new word, you should reach for your little black book and add that new word to

00:12:24.975 --> 00:12:25.245
it.

00:12:26.087 --> 00:12:32.207
But it doesn't just end here, you don't just write down the word, write down the definition, there

00:12:32.207 --> 00:12:37.367
are quite a few more things that you should be doing to give yourself the best possible chance at

00:12:37.727 --> 00:12:39.077
remembering that word.

00:12:40.207 --> 00:12:47.257
So write down the word in context - write it down first in the context of how you came across it,

00:12:48.007 --> 00:12:50.527
and then write it down in another context.

00:12:52.177 --> 00:12:58.897
Good dictionaries will often have these other contexts and other examples that you can just jot

00:12:58.897 --> 00:13:05.467
down, but you should also think about it yourself, create a sentence yourself and write that down.

00:13:07.027 --> 00:13:07.537
Why?

00:13:08.047 --> 00:13:14.827
Well because it's only through contextual repetition that you will give yourself the best chance of

00:13:15.217 --> 00:13:17.167
remembering that particular word.

00:13:18.726 --> 00:13:25.867
Some of us, and I'm certainly in this category, have very visual memories too, so to remember the

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:30.217
word you need to see it written down or you need to write it yourself.

00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:37.942
My wife, for example, whenever she comes across a new word in English, she asks for it to be spelled

00:13:37.942 --> 00:13:41.002
out for her as that's the way her brain works.

00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:48.441
So you need to write it down, and write down the definition, and write down some sentences in

00:13:48.441 --> 00:13:49.131
context.

00:13:49.503 --> 00:13:54.558
But you should also practice saying it out loud and if you're comfortable with the phonetic

00:13:54.558 --> 00:13:58.008
alphabet, write it down in IPA as well.

00:13:59.193 --> 00:13:59.703
Why?

00:14:00.093 --> 00:14:05.913
Well, for most people, they want to be able to recognise words when they are spoken and to be able

00:14:05.913 --> 00:14:08.073
to pronounce them in the correct way.

00:14:08.883 --> 00:14:13.893
They don't just need to be able to recognise them written down or to be able to write them.

00:14:14.163 --> 00:14:17.403
We're not talking about reading and writing Latin here.

00:14:18.843 --> 00:14:24.273
With all of these activities that you're doing as you're looking up these words in the dictionary,

00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:30.453
the amazing thing that's happening is that you are actually just creating your own dictionary.

00:14:31.473 --> 00:14:37.683
You are creating a dictionary of words that you have come across through being in contact with

00:14:37.683 --> 00:14:44.253
English, a dictionary that you can revisit at any time, packed full of words that you can now

00:14:44.253 --> 00:14:48.888
concentrate on memorising, or rather concentrate on not forgetting.

00:14:50.118 --> 00:14:57.558
And words that are actually relevant to you, and they're relevant because you've come across them

00:14:57.588 --> 00:15:03.738
naturally through coming into contact with English in your day-to-day life.

00:15:04.218 --> 00:15:10.008
They are relevant to things that you are interested in to your life and to the kind of language that

00:15:10.008 --> 00:15:11.778
you want to use to communicate.

00:15:12.528 --> 00:15:17.928
So they're more relevant, you'll use them more frequently and therefore you're more likely to

00:15:17.928 --> 00:15:18.378
remember them.

00:15:20.208 --> 00:15:27.498
The title of this podcast is actually how to use a dictionary to learn English, but this is perhaps

00:15:27.498 --> 00:15:28.488
a little deceptive.

00:15:28.938 --> 00:15:34.398
The answer really is to use the dictionary to create your own mini dictionary.

00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:41.971
One other dictionary that is certainly worth talking about is something that is both amazing and

00:15:41.971 --> 00:15:49.692
terrible at the same time, and I guess a lot of you probably use it on a daily basis, and that is

00:15:49.692 --> 00:15:50.802
Google Translate.

00:15:51.852 --> 00:15:58.602
Google Translate is both the English learner's best friend and the English learner's worst enemy.

00:15:59.612 --> 00:16:07.232
It's incredibly powerful and the translations of sentences and entire pieces of text can actually be

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:07.922
pretty good.

00:16:09.213 --> 00:16:15.063
The Leonardo English blog, which I definitely recommend you checking out if you haven't already, has

00:16:15.093 --> 00:16:20.373
a Spanish version that's powered entirely by Google Translate.

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:27.963
We're going to be adding more languages shortly, but at the moment, so that's as of January the 31st

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:29.823
there's just a Spanish one.

00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:38.418
Google Translate also has some really cool functionality that I guess some of you will already be

00:16:38.418 --> 00:16:43.668
familiar with, so things like you can take pictures of words with your phone and it will

00:16:43.668 --> 00:16:50.118
automatically translate them, you can do handwriting, voice recognition, and all sorts of great

00:16:50.118 --> 00:16:50.628
stuff.

00:16:51.588 --> 00:16:57.078
If you're using Chrome on your mobile, you can even highlight a word and press translate to get it

00:16:57.108 --> 00:16:58.078
Google Translated.

00:16:58.878 --> 00:17:06.228
And every word has a speak out loud button, which is really handy for understanding how to pronounce

00:17:06.228 --> 00:17:07.068
tricky words.

00:17:08.238 --> 00:17:17.748
So don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic tool for lots and lots of use cases, but, and this is a big

00:17:17.748 --> 00:17:26.373
but, Google Translate is no substitute for a dictionary, and when looking up single words, not in

00:17:26.373 --> 00:17:29.103
context, it often falls short.

00:17:29.643 --> 00:17:34.923
It often gives definitions that aren't correct in the context of a sentence.

00:17:36.843 --> 00:17:43.623
English is a particularly difficult language for words that have multiple meanings based on the

00:17:43.623 --> 00:17:49.518
context that they're in, and if you're looking up the definition of a word, Google Translate will

00:17:49.518 --> 00:17:54.468
often provide a translation which is incorrect in the context of the word.

00:17:55.758 --> 00:18:01.098
So long story short, don't use Google Translate as a bilingual dictionary.

00:18:02.688 --> 00:18:09.648
My personal preference, and this works for English to the majority of the language pairs where

00:18:09.648 --> 00:18:13.368
people are listening to this podcast is Word Reference.

00:18:15.288 --> 00:18:20.088
I imagine some of you might use Word Reference already, but for those of you who don't, I'll just

00:18:20.088 --> 00:18:23.388
explain exactly why I think it is the one to use.

00:18:24.228 --> 00:18:30.378
So with Word Reference, you get a monolingual dictionary and a bilingual dictionary in one.

00:18:31.158 --> 00:18:38.358
You can see the definition in English and your own language, plus you get several examples of the

00:18:38.358 --> 00:18:42.378
word in context and synonyms in both languages.

00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:50.028
So if you're looking for a dictionary that you can get online or as an app, Word Reference is

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:55.908
definitely an excellent option, although there are, of course, many others that do a pretty similar

00:18:55.908 --> 00:18:56.208
thing.

00:18:57.188 --> 00:19:05.139
So as I said, this podcast didn't have a huge list of dictionaries to buy or apps to download, but I

00:19:05.139 --> 00:19:10.779
hope it has helped give you an idea of the kinds of things that you should be doing to use a

00:19:10.779 --> 00:19:12.669
dictionary to its fullest potential.

00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:21.399
And as with any advice on this podcast and any advice you get from anyone, you should always take it

00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:22.449
with a pinch of salt.

00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:28.431
You need to find out what works for you, and every language learner is different.

00:19:29.841 --> 00:19:35.841
What I hope you have learned though, is that the dictionary can be a lot more powerful than just

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.641
telling you the meaning of a word.

00:19:38.459 --> 00:19:45.684
A dictionary holds the keys to the building blocks of any language, and if you get into good habits

00:19:45.744 --> 00:19:52.404
of using them in the most effective ways, you'll find yourself progressing far more quickly than if

00:19:52.404 --> 00:19:56.574
you're just using them to quickly look up the meanings of words and move on.

00:19:58.299 --> 00:20:04.869
So give it a go if you are not doing this already, trying looking words up in a dictionary in the

00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:11.834
way that I suggested, test it out for a good chunk of time, at least two weeks, then let me know how

00:20:11.834 --> 00:20:12.404
you get on.

00:20:12.734 --> 00:20:13.724
I'd love to hear it.

00:20:15.224 --> 00:20:20.024
I'll be doing exactly the same as I'm learning Spanish this year.

00:20:20.414 --> 00:20:26.174
I didn't speak a word of Spanish at the start of 2020 and I'm making it my mission to learn it to at

00:20:26.174 --> 00:20:35.384
least a B2 standard using only language acquisition tools so podcasts, reading articles, that kind

00:20:35.384 --> 00:20:35.864
of stuff.

00:20:36.344 --> 00:20:40.844
And of course I'll be using a dictionary in exactly the way that I've just spoken about.

00:20:42.498 --> 00:20:50.169
Okay, that is it for today's inaugural English Learning for Curious Minds members-only podcast.

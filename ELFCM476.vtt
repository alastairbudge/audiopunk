Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.060
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.019
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.850
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about ice cream.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.230
But today’s story isn’t really about ice cream, it’s about murder, police corruption,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.050
drugs, prison, Glasgow, Buckingham Palace, and a two-decade-long fight for justice.

00:00:39.128 --> 00:00:45.008
Ok then, let’s get right into it and talk about the Glasgow Ice Cream Wars.

00:00:46.938 --> 00:00:52.228
I imagine that many of you might have memories of your childhood that include ice cream.

00:00:52.998 --> 00:00:57.948
Maybe that’s eating ice cream at the beach, perhaps it’s being allowed to go down to the ice

00:00:57.948 --> 00:01:04.048
cream shop on a Saturday afternoon, maybe it’s being taken to your favourite ice cream shop by a

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:10.298
grandparent and being able to choose an extra scoop, or a flavour that you weren’t normally allowed.

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:12.428
The U.K.

00:01:12.908 --> 00:01:17.168
isn't a part of the world that is particularly associated with ice cream.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:24.198
Sure, there are some ice cream shops, but the fact that it is cold and wet for

00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:28.868
a lot of the year probably means that there aren’t as many days when people feel

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:33.708
like a cold, refreshing ice cream as there are in Italy or Spain, let’s say.

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:38.438
What every British person of a certain generation will

00:01:38.438 --> 00:01:42.812
recognise, however, is the sound of the ice cream van.

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:50.725
Children would hear this tell-tale jingle, plead with

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:54.325
their parents for some coins, and rush towards the van.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:00.685
These kinds of vans were popular all over the country, and were in

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:06.005
particularly high demand in areas without easy access to ice cream.

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:13.415
This was, really, most of the country, as ice cream shops aren’t so common in the UK, but there

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:19.965
was one area in particular where the residents cheered in ecstasy when they heard this sound.

00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:27.035
Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland, had been an economic and industrial

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:33.175
powerhouse in the 19th and early 20th century, but by the 1960s, with

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:38.355
many of the major industries closing, the city was in a downward spiral.

00:02:39.645 --> 00:02:43.975
The centre of the city was crowded and unsanitary, people

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:48.205
crammed into small apartments, often without their own toilet.

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:54.105
There was a mass project to move people out from the centre to

00:02:54.105 --> 00:02:58.755
new so-called “schemes”, housing developments outside the city.

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:05.275
The apartments would be fit for purpose, they would be practical, they would have

00:03:05.295 --> 00:03:11.155
proper bathrooms and toilets, it would be a big step up from the previous situation.

00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:17.815
As this took place, there was a mass mobilisation of people out from the centre.

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:21.865
It was, in many ways, a big improvement.

00:03:22.315 --> 00:03:26.275
Better housing, green fields to play in, and fresh air.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:32.693
The major problem was that the planners and architects hadn’t thought of everything.

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:38.443
Public transport options were limited, and there weren’t enough shops.

00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:46.523
Soon enough, entrepreneurial Glaswegians, people from Glasgow, stepped up to plug the gap.

00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:51.743
There would be grocery vans, fishmongers, and people selling fresh

00:03:51.743 --> 00:03:56.213
vegetables who would drive up to the schemes, make their presence known,

00:03:56.733 --> 00:04:01.483
and would find that they were flooded with potential customers in no time.

00:04:02.963 --> 00:04:08.823
And for the kids, ice cream vans soon started to pull up to the estates,

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:13.253
their trademark music playing, and they would find that kids were

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:18.333
excitedly chasing after them and that there was a queue around the block.

00:04:19.213 --> 00:04:23.293
Or perhaps more realistically, as we are talking about kids here, their

00:04:23.293 --> 00:04:27.773
vans were surrounded by crowds of children thrusting coins in the general

00:04:27.773 --> 00:04:32.763
direction of the van and arguing amongst themselves about who was there first.

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:38.873
Now, ice cream was a relatively profitable thing to sell: high

00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:43.453
margins, customers who want it every day, and pretty easy to make.

00:04:44.663 --> 00:04:49.983
And ice cream van drivers became quite possessive over territory.

00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:56.303
Some routes and locations were more lucrative than others, and ice cream

00:04:56.303 --> 00:05:00.973
van drivers would resort to intimidation and violence to protect their

00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:06.013
territory, to make sure that nobody else sold ice cream to their customers.

00:05:07.413 --> 00:05:12.853
At the beginning it might be something relatively harmless, a rival driver

00:05:13.053 --> 00:05:18.053
squirting sticky raspberry ice cream sauce all over the windscreens, so that the

00:05:18.053 --> 00:05:21.753
other driver would have to spend hours getting it off because it was so sticky.

00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:26.233
But often it was more violent than that.

00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:32.563
Rivals would use baseball bats to smash windows, tyres

00:05:32.563 --> 00:05:36.343
would be slashed, vans would be put out of action.

00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:42.953
And this all took place in an area of the city without much of a police

00:05:42.993 --> 00:05:48.553
presence, a deprived area that was characterised by street gangs and petty crime.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:55.113
And before long, organised criminals started to enter the ice cream market.

00:05:55.973 --> 00:06:01.703
They bought up vans and got into the legitimate ice cream business, but they would also

00:06:01.703 --> 00:06:07.763
use ice cream vans to sell products that were not as frozen or innocent as ice cream.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.953
First it might be alcohol, cigarettes and tobacco.

00:06:13.513 --> 00:06:18.783
It might even be stolen goods, which criminals could take in a robbery during

00:06:18.793 --> 00:06:24.443
the night, load up into an ice cream van and sell by midday the following day.

00:06:25.663 --> 00:06:31.953
Others went a step further still, selling hard drugs, in particular, heroin.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.723
Since the 1980s, Scotland has been battling a serious

00:06:37.793 --> 00:06:40.953
problem with drugs, and especially with heroin.

00:06:41.923 --> 00:06:48.923
Even today, Scotland has 5 times more drug-related deaths than England on a per capita basis.

00:06:49.963 --> 00:06:53.753
And back in the 1980s, in these economically deprived

00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:57.573
areas of Glasgow, heroin was a serious problem.

00:06:58.703 --> 00:07:04.443
For heroin users in these areas, the drug wasn’t particularly easy to get hold of,

00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:09.753
given that these areas were far out of the city centre and poorly connected by bus.

00:07:10.923 --> 00:07:17.463
Ice cream vans were the perfect vehicle, literally and figuratively, for selling heroin.

00:07:18.843 --> 00:07:24.773
Naturally they were on the go, they would travel from place to place, and there was nothing

00:07:24.813 --> 00:07:30.933
unusual about someone approaching a van and handing over money and being given something in return.

00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:35.773
There were already clear territories, and the ice cream

00:07:35.773 --> 00:07:39.993
trade was already characterised by violence and rivalry.

00:07:41.403 --> 00:07:48.833
As you might imagine, as the value of the goods sold from the trucks increased, so did the violence.

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:54.843
Gangs and drivers would go to extreme lengths to protect their most valuable routes,

00:07:55.243 --> 00:08:00.403
seizing territory from others through a mixture of intimidation and real violence.

00:08:01.373 --> 00:08:04.903
If an ice cream truck ventured into the wrong zone, it

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:09.263
would soon find its windows were smashed and tyres slashed.

00:08:10.183 --> 00:08:14.303
It was a period of intense violence, with anyone who didn’t

00:08:14.323 --> 00:08:18.093
comply falling victim to beatings and vicious attacks.

00:08:19.503 --> 00:08:25.553
Understandably, many complied, they went along out of fear of what would happen if they didn’t.

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:28.343
Many, but not all.

00:08:29.873 --> 00:08:35.883
One person who was not going to play by these rules, he was not going to sell drugs, and he wasn’t

00:08:35.893 --> 00:08:41.803
going to avoid an area just because some gang member told him to, was a man called Andrew Doyle.

00:08:43.263 --> 00:08:48.103
His nickname, which probably wouldn't be quite so acceptable today, was

00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:52.993
“Fatboy”, which seems a little unfair as he wasn’t even particularly fat.

00:08:54.013 --> 00:09:00.633
Anyway, Andrew Doyle was only 18 years old, but he was a good, upstanding citizen.

00:09:01.283 --> 00:09:05.253
He drove an ice cream truck, he wasn’t a drug dealer, and he wouldn’t

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:10.453
be intimidated into becoming one, or playing by the rules of the gangs.

00:09:11.473 --> 00:09:15.843
He would go where he wanted, if kids wanted ice cream, he would drive to

00:09:15.843 --> 00:09:20.083
sell it to them, he had no intention of playing by other people’s rules.

00:09:21.243 --> 00:09:27.093
But if you know anything about Scottish drug dealers, or perhaps we should say drug dealers in

00:09:27.103 --> 00:09:32.823
general, it is that they aren’t the sort of people to say “ok, no worries, have a good day!”

00:09:34.363 --> 00:09:39.243
After numerous threats, one day Doyle found two masked

00:09:39.253 --> 00:09:42.123
men in front of his ice cream truck with a shotgun.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:49.373
They fired a shot through the window, not aiming at him, but to the passenger side.

00:09:50.913 --> 00:09:53.613
The objective was clearly to frighten him.

00:09:54.483 --> 00:09:56.853
Next time we’ll point it at you.

00:09:58.323 --> 00:09:59.823
But Doyle wouldn’t budge.

00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:02.663
He wasn’t prepared to compromise his morals.

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:08.433
In April of 1984, the gang members decided that

00:10:08.453 --> 00:10:12.253
Doyle needed another frightening, or something worse.

00:10:12.943 --> 00:10:17.143
If a shotgun through the windscreen didn’t do it, he needed reminding

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:21.443
that they knew where he lived, and they could hurt him and his family.

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:27.903
In the early hours of the 16th of April 1984, a group of men

00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:32.053
approached Doyle’s apartment, where he and his family were sleeping.

00:10:33.253 --> 00:10:39.413
They poured petrol on the front door, lit a match, and ran off into the night.

00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:46.183
Black smoke gushed into the apartment, and the fire continued to spread.

00:10:47.353 --> 00:10:50.523
The fire brigade was called, but it was too late.

00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:56.733
Of the 9 people inside the apartment, 6 were killed.

00:10:58.183 --> 00:11:06.723
Andrew Doyle died, as did his father, two of his brothers, his sister, and her 18-month-old baby.

00:11:08.203 --> 00:11:12.083
His mother survived, but she would end up burying her

00:11:12.123 --> 00:11:17.333
husband, her daughter, three sons and her baby grandson.

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:24.453
It was all over the national news, a sign of the lawlessness of these housing schemes

00:11:24.553 --> 00:11:30.233
and the inability of the Glasgow police to do its job and enforce law and order.

00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:36.513
There was a huge investigation, but nobody was willing to speak to the police.

00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:37.723
Nothing.

00:11:38.253 --> 00:11:39.233
Not a word.

00:11:40.773 --> 00:11:43.613
Then, the police revealed a breakthrough.

00:11:44.983 --> 00:11:49.843
A man named William Love was willing to go on record and say that

00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:54.483
he had heard a group of men plotting in a pub about how they were

00:11:54.483 --> 00:11:59.253
going to set Doyle’s apartment on fire in a bid to intimidate him.

00:12:00.713 --> 00:12:06.593
This witness, William Love, was a petty criminal, and at the time that

00:12:06.603 --> 00:12:11.693
he gave this statement he was in jail awaiting trial for armed robbery.

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:19.853
The names that he gave the police were Thomas “TC” Campbell and Joe Steele.

00:12:21.393 --> 00:12:26.903
Now, these men, TC Campbell and Joe Steele, were no angels.

00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:30.973
TC Campbell was well-known to the police.

00:12:31.613 --> 00:12:37.163
He also had an ice cream van, registered in his wife’s name, and there had been reports

00:12:37.163 --> 00:12:42.693
that he had been intimidating people for years, including other ice cream van drivers

00:12:42.883 --> 00:12:47.983
in a bid to protect his most profitable routes, from which he would sell stolen goods.

00:12:48.843 --> 00:12:50.783
He was arrested shortly afterwards.

00:12:51.943 --> 00:12:55.683
When the police searched his house, they reported that

00:12:55.683 --> 00:12:59.553
they found a street map with Doyle’s apartment circled out.

00:13:00.573 --> 00:13:05.183
The police also claimed that TC Campbell confessed his involvement,

00:13:05.583 --> 00:13:09.753
even though TC Campbell denies ever having made any such confession.

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:17.353
The police also had another witness, another petty criminal who was in jail at the time.

00:13:18.443 --> 00:13:25.023
His name was Joseph Grainger, and he was willing to go on record saying that he was there at

00:13:25.023 --> 00:13:32.153
the scene of the crime, but it wasn’t him who lit the match: it was TC Campbell and Joe Steele.

00:13:33.363 --> 00:13:37.643
But TC Campbell and Joe Steele maintained their innocence.

00:13:38.573 --> 00:13:43.423
Sure, they might have done other things they regretted, but this wasn’t them.

00:13:43.753 --> 00:13:44.863
They were innocent.

00:13:46.363 --> 00:13:53.083
There was a trial, and the prosecution’s argument rested on four things: the testimony

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:58.283
of the first petty criminal, William Love, who said that he had overheard a plot

00:13:58.483 --> 00:14:04.193
being made at a pub, the other petty criminal Joseph Grainger, who said that it was TC

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:10.553
Campbell and Joe Steele, the map found in TC Campbell’s house, and the police statements.

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:16.643
The problem was, when Joseph Grainger was questioned, he broke down.

00:14:17.243 --> 00:14:22.603
He admitted that he had made it up, he wasn’t there and had never said he was,

00:14:23.103 --> 00:14:27.563
but the police had pressured him into signing this statement because they had

00:14:27.593 --> 00:14:33.663
told him that if he collaborated he would get off the other, unrelated charges.

00:14:35.033 --> 00:14:38.993
And then there was the question of the map found at TC Campbell’s house.

00:14:40.363 --> 00:14:46.713
It seemed odd, unusual, for someone who was a career criminal to leave such

00:14:46.713 --> 00:14:51.103
an obviously incriminating piece of evidence visible to anyone who would come

00:14:51.103 --> 00:14:56.183
into the house, especially as, if he really did commit the crime, he would

00:14:56.183 --> 00:14:59.953
presumably have thought that the police might come knocking on his door.

00:15:01.213 --> 00:15:05.773
All throughout, he protested his innocence, saying that the map must have

00:15:05.773 --> 00:15:11.493
been planted by the police, placed there in a bid to frame him for the crime.

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:17.363
Despite all of this, the jury was unanimous in its decision.

00:15:18.553 --> 00:15:24.793
The two men were guilty, and were each sentenced to life, at least 20 years in prison.

00:15:25.963 --> 00:15:30.333
The public was sick to death of the violence that had plagued the city,

00:15:30.633 --> 00:15:36.133
and horrified by the fact that an entire innocent law-abiding family,

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:40.893
including an 18-month-old baby, had been murdered in their sleep.

00:15:42.263 --> 00:15:48.993
The jury no doubt saw these two men who were well-known violent criminals and thought, well,

00:15:49.373 --> 00:15:54.963
perhaps the evidence is a bit flimsy, but the city will be safer if they are behind bars.

00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:59.453
They were duly sent to prison, but constantly appealed.

00:15:59.683 --> 00:16:03.433
It wasn’t us, they said, you have the wrong people.

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:08.893
Campbell went on hunger strike in a bid to try to get a retrial.

00:16:10.163 --> 00:16:13.663
Steele, on the other hand, had a different approach.

00:16:14.653 --> 00:16:18.053
He escaped from prison, doing so three times.

00:16:18.863 --> 00:16:23.253
And every time he escaped, he did some kind of publicity

00:16:23.253 --> 00:16:26.363
stunt to try to draw attention to his situation.

00:16:27.493 --> 00:16:32.103
The first time he climbed onto the roof of his mother’s house and shouted

00:16:32.113 --> 00:16:36.933
down his defence, but the following time he went one step further.

00:16:37.943 --> 00:16:43.463
He travelled to London, leaving Scotland for the first time in his life, and glued

00:16:43.673 --> 00:16:49.273
and handcuffed himself to the gates of Buckingham Palace, the royal residence,

00:16:49.493 --> 00:16:54.333
in a bid to speak to the journalists who descended to cover this unusual story.

00:16:55.363 --> 00:17:02.663
And it was…unusual, to go to all of the effort of escaping but to do something that would mean you

00:17:02.663 --> 00:17:08.553
would immediately be arrested, only to draw attention to the fact that you said you were innocent.

00:17:09.343 --> 00:17:12.883
It didn’t necessarily look like the actions of a guilty man.

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:15.663
But it didn’t work.

00:17:16.353 --> 00:17:21.843
Steele was immediately put back in prison, and his request for an appeal denied.

00:17:23.263 --> 00:17:27.633
Fast forward a few years, and in 1992 there was a breakthrough.

00:17:28.913 --> 00:17:33.503
The case’s supposed “star witness”, William Love, admitted

00:17:33.513 --> 00:17:37.733
to journalists that he too had made the entire thing up.

00:17:38.593 --> 00:17:43.973
He said that police had encouraged him to testify against TC Campbell and Joe Steele, and

00:17:44.133 --> 00:17:49.003
he had gone along with it because he thought that they would let him off the other charges.

00:17:50.273 --> 00:17:54.133
But this was a private conversation between Love and

00:17:54.143 --> 00:17:57.863
journalists, it wasn’t evidence in a Scottish court of law.

00:17:59.103 --> 00:18:02.793
Still, it was a strong sign that the men were not

00:18:02.823 --> 00:18:06.333
guilty, or at least, that the case should be revisited.

00:18:07.283 --> 00:18:11.573
So, in 1996, pending the appeal, the two men were

00:18:11.573 --> 00:18:15.443
released on bail, 12 years after being sent to prison.

00:18:16.013 --> 00:18:17.823
They were free, finally.

00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:22.453
Two years later, they had their day in court, the case

00:18:22.453 --> 00:18:25.693
was duly referred to the Scottish Courts of Appeal.

00:18:26.915 --> 00:18:31.333
But, to their horror, their appeal was refused.

00:18:32.173 --> 00:18:36.913
Even though William Love had said that his testimony was a lie, meaning that

00:18:36.913 --> 00:18:41.163
there were now no witnesses putting them at the scene of the crime, there

00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:45.273
were still the statements from police officers saying that the two men had

00:18:45.273 --> 00:18:50.693
confessed, statements that the two men vehemently deny ever having made.

00:18:52.128 --> 00:18:57.068
Still the judge’s verdict stood; after living for two years as

00:18:57.068 --> 00:19:01.358
free men, TC Campbell and Joe Steele were sent back to prison.

00:19:02.888 --> 00:19:09.708
It wouldn’t be until 2004, 20 years after the crime, that the case was referred again,

00:19:10.278 --> 00:19:15.038
and a committee decided that the evidence of the police officers was not reliable.

00:19:16.308 --> 00:19:20.468
In other words, the police officers lied about Campbell and

00:19:20.468 --> 00:19:24.608
Steele’s confessions in a bid to frame them for the crime.

00:19:25.708 --> 00:19:31.608
The pair were officially declared innocent, and they were allowed to walk free after

00:19:31.608 --> 00:19:36.808
two decades of being thought of as the men who burned an innocent family to death.

00:19:37.858 --> 00:19:42.268
And the people who really committed the crime, if we are to presume

00:19:42.268 --> 00:19:46.878
that TC Campbell and Joe Steele are innocent, the guilty parties

00:19:47.078 --> 00:19:51.658
have never been found, nobody else has been convicted for the crime.

00:19:53.008 --> 00:19:58.423
In an interview from 2019, Joe Steele told a Scottish newspaper that it

00:19:58.428 --> 00:20:02.668
was another local criminal called Tam McGraw who was behind the murder.

00:20:03.978 --> 00:20:09.168
He was, according to Steele, a close friend of the police, and that’s why the

00:20:09.178 --> 00:20:13.798
law enforcement officers tried so hard to pin the crime on TC Campbell and Joe

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:18.338
Steele, so that their friend and associate wouldn’t have to pay for what he did.

00:20:19.658 --> 00:20:24.718
Tam McGraw was asked about the murder, but he always denied it, and if

00:20:24.718 --> 00:20:29.928
it really was him, he took the truth to the grave, as he died in 2007.

00:20:30.968 --> 00:20:36.318
Now, there’s an urban legend that ice cream trucks are banned in Glasgow because of

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:41.308
the city’s history with them being used by criminals to sell drugs and stolen goods.

00:20:42.288 --> 00:20:47.078
It isn’t quite correct to say that, but several housing schemes have banned them.

00:20:48.278 --> 00:20:53.318
It’s more from a public health point of view, to curb Scottish obesity rates,

00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:58.368
but certainly for many Glasgow residents who were alive during this period,

00:20:58.778 --> 00:21:03.338
the noise of an ice cream van brings back memories they would prefer to forget.

00:21:05.938 --> 00:21:10.398
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the Glasgow Ice Cream Wars.

00:21:10.758 --> 00:21:13.438
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

Have you been to Glasgow?

00:21:15.388 --> 00:21:16.998
Have you heard of this story before?

00:21:17.388 --> 00:21:19.978
What other similar stories are there from your country?

00:21:20.368 --> 00:21:21.398

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:15.777
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:19.817
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:25.567
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part mini-series.

00:00:26.157 --> 00:00:30.337
This one is going to be about “controversial sportspeople”, talented

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:34.647
men and women from the world of sport who left a complicated legacy.

00:00:35.177 --> 00:00:39.287
Part one, today’s episode, is going to be about a man many consider

00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:43.537
to be the most naturally gifted footballer in history, George Best.

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.757
Part two is going to be on the American figure skater, Tonya Harding, who

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:52.527
got embroiled in one of the greatest controversies in skating history.

00:00:53.327 --> 00:00:56.757
And part three is going to be on Lance Armstrong, the

00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.437
record-breaking cancer-surviving cyclist who lost it all.

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:07.518
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the wild life of George Best.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.598
There are few more divisive questions to ask a group of

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:17.828
football fans than “who is the greatest footballer of all time”.

00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:21.208
Pele, Maradona, Johan Cruyff.

00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:28.038
Or more recently, you might find names like Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi thrown in the hat.

00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:33.728
In most of these cases, certainly with the more recent 21st-century

00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:37.208
footballers, they were incredibly disciplined, treating their

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:42.528
bodies as tools, temples even, to be attended to and cared for.

00:01:43.148 --> 00:01:46.838
They were professional athletes, football was their world.

00:01:47.778 --> 00:01:55.148
And they also had and have vast teams of people supporting them: nutritionists, physiotherapists,

00:01:55.568 --> 00:02:02.318
agents and managers, people whose entire job it is to ensure that they are in peak physical

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:07.318
and mental condition and are able to perform at the top of their game on the pitch.

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:13.378
The subject of today's episode, George Best, was not in this category.

00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:19.308
If you have heard of George Best, and especially for those of you who are not

00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:24.318
die-hard football fans, you will probably associate him with other things.

00:02:25.408 --> 00:02:28.938
Alcohol, womanising, and an early grave.

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:33.777
In fact, it is quite the miracle that George Best is even

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:37.607
mentioned in the same breath as people like Ronaldo and Messi.

00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:43.627
People like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have both been playing professionally

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:48.947
for over 20 years and are still doing so as they approach their 40th birthday.

00:02:49.577 --> 00:02:54.107
They have long and storied careers, have won dozens of trophies at

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:58.877
club and national level, and scored going on 1,000 professional goals.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:05.415
The career of George Best, on the other hand, peaked when he was 22.

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:12.307
He is remembered as a legend in Manchester United history, one of the club’s greatest players,

00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:20.007
but he was pushed out when he was 27 and spent the rest of his career playing for clubs so

00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:25.277
obscure that I imagine even the most passionate of football fans won’t have heard of all of them.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:31.447
Unlike Messi or Ronaldo, or in fact any of those players I mentioned at the start,

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:36.627
he didn’t get anywhere near a World Cup final; he didn’t even play at the World Cup.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:42.487
He was perhaps the ultimate example of a player who could have had it all, a

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:47.317
sportsman so naturally talented that he might just have been the undisputed

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:53.067
greatest player of all time, but he let his smorgasbord of vices get in the way.

00:03:54.517 --> 00:04:01.347
He was born in 1946 in a working-class area of Belfast, the capital city of Northern Ireland.

00:04:02.247 --> 00:04:06.277
He was a talented boy, both academically and sportingly.

00:04:06.867 --> 00:04:13.627
He was smart, funny and witty, but it would be his footballing talents that were first noticed.

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:20.567
He was playing for a local youth club when he was noticed by a scout for Manchester United.

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:28.117
The scout saw the then 15-year-old Best playing and immediately knew he had found something special.

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:34.267
He sent a telegram straight away to Matt Busby, the Manchester United

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:40.357
manager, which legend has it read "I think I've found you a genius."

00:04:41.816 --> 00:04:48.076
Best was given a trial and promptly signed up for the Manchester United youth team, but

00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:53.576
he was a shy, quiet boy who had never travelled more than 10 kilometres away from home.

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:59.916
He was a Belfast boy, and there he was in Manchester, away from his family,

00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:04.616
in a strange unknown city where people looked and spoke differently.

00:05:06.026 --> 00:05:12.846
He only lasted two days before getting so homesick that he got on the next boat back to Belfast.

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:18.896
He was persuaded to return to Manchester, and ended up training with the Manchester

00:05:18.896 --> 00:05:24.316
United youth team for a couple of years before making his official debut when he was 17.

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:31.476
This was in 1963, so only a few years after the Munich Air Disaster which

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:35.506
killed eight Manchester United players and seriously injured six more.

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:41.026
The Manchester United manager, Matt Busby, was one of the few

00:05:41.056 --> 00:05:45.126
survivors of the crash, and was trying to rebuild his squad.

00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:53.326
And after Best’s first team debut in 1963, the squad came to be moulded around him.

00:05:54.596 --> 00:05:58.726
Now, I don’t want to talk too much about the football of George

00:05:58.726 --> 00:06:02.356
Best in this episode, but we clearly have to do some of this.

00:06:03.656 --> 00:06:06.736
The first thing to note is that he was very small.

00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:13.752
When he was first “discovered”, he was 160 cm tall and weighed

00:06:13.752 --> 00:06:19.786
47 kilos, and even as a full-grown man he was only 1 metre 75.

00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:27.336
He was much smaller than everyone else on the pitch, and in fact plenty of other scouts had

00:06:27.336 --> 00:06:33.786
come to see him before the Manchester United one, but decided that he was simply too small.

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:39.476
He was tiny with legs like matchsticks; he wouldn’t last a minute professionally.

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:42.216
Of course, they were wrong.

00:06:42.656 --> 00:06:47.986
He was incredibly fast, he was skilful, he was equally comfortable with his right

00:06:47.986 --> 00:06:53.406
foot as with his left, and he could dribble the ball past his opponents with ease.

00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:58.326
This meant that he was typically man-marked, there would be someone on the

00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:03.196
opposition team who was on his back at all times, and opposition players would

00:07:03.206 --> 00:07:08.386
be very physically aggressive towards him, but somehow he managed to evade them.

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:14.606
By 1964, when he was only 18, he was a first-team regular.

00:07:15.776 --> 00:07:22.316
He soon became a fans' favourite, and in March of 1966, he was catapulted to

00:07:22.336 --> 00:07:27.996
global, or at least European fame, when he scored two goals and dominated the

00:07:27.996 --> 00:07:32.576
match in the European Cup quarter-final against the Portuguese side, Benfica.

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:38.936
But it wasn’t just his footballing abilities that caught people’s attention.

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:44.056
He was incredibly handsome and he had long, wavy, hair,

00:07:44.416 --> 00:07:46.826
which was a rarity for football players at the time.

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:49.466
Most kept it cut very short.

00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:55.456
He looked more like he should be on stage or on a film set than on a football pitch.

00:07:56.636 --> 00:08:01.016
Indeed, after that quarter-final match in Portugal, he was dubbed

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:04.906
“The Fifth Beatle”, because that’s what people thought he looked like.

00:08:06.376 --> 00:08:11.986
And alongside his glittering career on the pitch, which included winning the league with Manchester

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:19.036
United and then winning European Player of the Year in 1968, he had quite a busy life off the pitch.

00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:25.046
He was a famous womaniser, and could be seen in the nightclubs of Manchester

00:08:25.056 --> 00:08:29.376
or the fashionable streets of London with a different woman on his arm.

00:08:30.283 --> 00:08:34.681
He was also one of the first football players, in the UK at least,

00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:39.141
to tap into his celebrity to supplement his footballing income.

00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:47.601
He promoted everything from sausages to cigarettes, he did cameos for movies, and he said that

00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:54.721
by 1969 his income from outside football was greater than what he was paid by Manchester United.

00:08:56.221 --> 00:09:01.221
This did make him a rich man by anyone’s standards, but two things.

00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:08.881
Firstly, he was incredibly generous, and would reportedly give £10 notes to homeless people.

00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:15.761
£10 is just under €12 today, it might sound like a pretty generous amount of money

00:09:16.001 --> 00:09:21.345
to give to a stranger, but back then it was the equivalent of something like €150.

00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:26.971
And secondly, footballers back then, even megastars like George

00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:30.711
Best, were really not paid very much by modern standards.

00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:39.031
George Best made history in 1969 when he became the first footballer to earn £1,000 a week.

00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:47.761
That’s about €16,000 a week in inflation-adjusted terms, something like €830,000 a year.

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:53.771
Sure, it is a lot of money, but it is a pittance, it is nothing,

00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:56.721
compared to what the footballing stars of today are paid.

00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:03.289
And what’s more, this was in the era of tax rates that went up to 90%

00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:07.261
for the highest earners, a rate so high that it would even result in

00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:11.721
The Beatles releasing a song in protest, appropriately called “Taxman”.

00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:17.131
The point is, yes George Best was a highly-paid celebrity and football

00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:22.081
player, but compared to modern players this was a very different league.

00:10:23.261 --> 00:10:29.921
And his expenses were significant, the money seemed to go out just as quickly as it came in.

00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:36.071
He was a funny and witty man throughout his life, and one of his most famous

00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:40.631
quotes was in response to a journalist who asked him where all of his money went.

00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:45.661
Before I tell you what he said, I’ll just explain a few words.

00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:50.591
Booze is slang for alcohol, an informal term for alcohol.

00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:57.451
Birds is a slang term for women, one that is certainly less acceptable now than it was at the time.

00:10:58.286 --> 00:11:05.563
And to squander means to waste something, normally money, on something stupid or foolish.

00:11:06.503 --> 00:11:11.753
So, to a journalist who asked him where all of his money went, he thought for

00:11:11.753 --> 00:11:18.223
a moment and then said “I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars.

00:11:18.763 --> 00:11:20.683
The rest I just squandered."

00:11:22.363 --> 00:11:27.713
Now, you might laugh, you might find this to be a witty response, but beneath

00:11:27.713 --> 00:11:33.383
it is a sad truth, and a truth that Best was clearly acutely aware of.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:36.513
He was a raging alcoholic.

00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:41.843
Alcohol destroyed his life, two marriages, his playing

00:11:41.843 --> 00:11:45.803
career, and eventually killed him at the age of 59.

00:11:47.323 --> 00:11:51.673
While many of his Manchester United teammates would go out for a big night

00:11:51.673 --> 00:11:55.563
out after a game on a Saturday, or they would have a few beers in the

00:11:55.563 --> 00:12:01.657
evening, by his mid-20s George Best found that alcohol controlled him.

00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:08.993
There are all sorts of theories about why he succumbed to alcoholism and failed to control

00:12:08.993 --> 00:12:15.161
himself, while others managed to maintain a healthier, non-destructive, relationship with alcohol.

00:12:16.708 --> 00:12:21.458
One is that alcoholism ran in his family; his mother was

00:12:21.458 --> 00:12:25.348
an alcoholic and also died from alcoholism when she was 55.

00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:30.428
He was genetically predisposed to alcoholism, so while other players

00:12:30.428 --> 00:12:34.368
could manage to drink in moderation, he simply couldn’t help himself.

00:12:35.798 --> 00:12:41.158
Another was that there was simply so much pressure on him to succeed, so much

00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:47.088
pressure from fans, teammates and his manager to lift up Manchester United that

00:12:47.088 --> 00:12:52.678
when the team stopped winning, he sought solace, some kind of escape, with drink.

00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:59.361
Another is that he was such a celebrity that this was his way of escaping the real world.

00:12:59.781 --> 00:13:04.301
He was hounded by the press, he simply couldn’t go out and live

00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:08.271
a normal life, so he retreated into the world of drunkenness.

00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:13.741
Another was that he was a shy and reserved person by nature, and

00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:18.271
that alcohol gave him the confidence to be the outgoing playboy-type

00:13:18.281 --> 00:13:21.511
character that the tabloid newspapers were making him out to be.

00:13:22.691 --> 00:13:27.071
It gave him the confidence to talk to women, and to be the rock star

00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:31.021
that people thought he was, but that didn’t come naturally to him.

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:36.401
Whatever the reasons, it was something that he was unable to control.

00:13:37.891 --> 00:13:41.681
By the time he was 25, he was missing training sessions,

00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:45.581
his fitness got worse, everything deteriorated.

00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:51.731
I mean, alcoholism can take over anyone’s life, but it is certainly

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:56.176
completely incompatible with a career as a professional footballer.

00:13:57.111 --> 00:14:03.171
He was pushed out of Manchester United when he was 27, and he went on to play for 12

00:14:03.211 --> 00:14:09.321
different teams everywhere from South Africa to the United States, Australia to Ireland.

00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:15.991
He still had the star power, and whenever a club announced that they had signed the

00:14:15.991 --> 00:14:21.681
legend that was George Best, he would pull in the crowds, ticket sales would increase.

00:14:23.041 --> 00:14:29.201
And even as he got older and less fit, he was still capable of some electric football.

00:14:30.251 --> 00:14:35.891
If you watch videos on YouTube from his time in the United States, for example, there are amazing

00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:42.011
clips of him running around defenders as if they were little children and scoring fantastic goals.

00:14:43.001 --> 00:14:48.021
Despite the demons off the pitch, the natural talent was there for all to see.

00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:53.258
But his alcoholism went from bad to worse.

00:14:53.898 --> 00:14:57.518
He would go on huge drinking sessions, days at a time,

00:14:57.928 --> 00:15:01.958
unable to be located by friends, family, or his teammates.

00:15:03.218 --> 00:15:09.308
By 1984, after wandering from club to club for 10 years after leaving Manchester

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:14.718
United, he hung up his boots for good, retiring as a professional football player.

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:21.458
After retiring, he tried his hand at several different things: being a football

00:15:21.498 --> 00:15:26.968
pundit and becoming involved in various business ventures, but nothing really stuck.

00:15:28.408 --> 00:15:32.488
His life was, unfortunately, dominated by alcohol.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:39.938
By the year 2000, his body was giving up, and he needed to have a liver transplant.

00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:45.628
He was told in no uncertain terms by doctors, “if you

00:15:45.628 --> 00:15:49.648
keep drinking it will kill you”, but he couldn’t stop.

00:15:51.108 --> 00:15:57.538
In November of 2005, at his request, the British News of the World tabloid newspaper

00:15:57.928 --> 00:16:04.368
published a particularly sad photo of him in hospital with the headline "Don't die like me".

00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:10.928
The picture shows the former footballing legend and heart-throb as an old man

00:16:10.928 --> 00:16:16.938
with red eyes and yellow, jaundiced skin, oxygen being pumped in through his nose.

00:16:17.608 --> 00:16:22.468
He weighed barely 40 kilogrammes, he was a shadow of his former self.

00:16:24.238 --> 00:16:28.738
Less than a week later, he was dead, at the age of 59.

00:16:30.178 --> 00:16:33.848
It was an ignominious end for one of the greatest footballers in

00:16:33.848 --> 00:16:39.188
history, and a man whose playing career only really lasted for 5 years.

00:16:40.598 --> 00:16:45.378
As you might imagine, in the months and years after his death, friends,

00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:49.868
former teammates and commentators have asked themselves “what went wrong?”

00:16:51.138 --> 00:16:56.588
He arrived in Manchester as a shy, quiet boy, and by the time

00:16:56.588 --> 00:17:00.868
he left, he was a raging alcoholic on a self-destructive path.

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:03.218
Was it the pressure?

00:17:04.168 --> 00:17:09.168
From the age of 15, he had this “genius” tag hung around his neck.

00:17:09.768 --> 00:17:15.068
He was incredibly talented, the crowds loved him, he was cheered by the opposition too.

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:20.728
He was fiendishly handsome, and soon found that women would throw themselves at him.

00:17:21.828 --> 00:17:24.658
According to one report, he tried to name all of his

00:17:24.658 --> 00:17:28.788
former lovers but decided to give up after he got to 1,000.

00:17:29.878 --> 00:17:34.948
He married twice, but both ended in divorce, with his second wife claiming

00:17:34.948 --> 00:17:38.878
that he had hit her multiple times, once punching her in the face.

00:17:39.728 --> 00:17:44.638
He was not only a drunk, but a violent one at that, and one that

00:17:44.638 --> 00:17:48.408
did mental and physical damage to everyone who tried to help him.

00:17:49.848 --> 00:17:55.218
And to his critics, he had the choice to drink; alcoholism might be

00:17:55.218 --> 00:17:59.618
a disease but every time he decided to buy another bottle of vodka or

00:17:59.878 --> 00:18:04.008
stay at the pub for another double whisky, he was choosing destruction.

00:18:05.398 --> 00:18:11.928
But to others, this was his escape, or at least it started out as a way of escaping what

00:18:11.938 --> 00:18:16.958
must have been a completely surreal world for a shy young boy from Northern Ireland.

00:18:18.288 --> 00:18:22.278
He thought it was just a few innocent beers to “take the edge off”,

00:18:22.488 --> 00:18:26.828
to give him some confidence and help him relax after a tough match.

00:18:27.848 --> 00:18:31.128
But little did he know it would destroy everything.

00:18:32.628 --> 00:18:37.418
Now, that’s a sad note to end on, so let me end with a little language

00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:41.808
lesson on the theme of religion, Northern Ireland and George Best.

00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:48.278
As you heard, George Best was one of those rare footballing talents who was just as

00:18:48.278 --> 00:18:54.818
comfortable with his left foot as with his right, he was both a right-footer and a left-footer.

00:18:56.138 --> 00:19:01.818
There are some jokes about this, because in English “left-footer” is somewhat

00:19:01.848 --> 00:19:07.408
derogatory slang for Catholic and “right-footer” is slang for Protestant.

00:19:08.768 --> 00:19:13.258
And, as you’ll remember, George Best came from Belfast in Northern Ireland,

00:19:13.538 --> 00:19:18.888
an area of intense tension and rivalry between Catholics and Protestants.

00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:25.858
But the thing about George Best was that he was someone who seemed to transcend all of that.

00:19:26.818 --> 00:19:31.808
He was Protestant by birth, but he was loved by Protestants and Catholics

00:19:31.808 --> 00:19:36.988
alike, a footballer who truly played with and played for both feet.

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:43.378
So, to wrap things up, George Best must surely go down in history as

00:19:43.378 --> 00:19:48.618
one of the greatest wasted talents in sporting history, a man who had

00:19:48.618 --> 00:19:53.898
it all, who could have had even more, but let his demons get in the way.

00:19:55.688 --> 00:20:00.978
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the wild and sad life of George Best.

00:20:01.318 --> 00:20:04.438
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:05.188 --> 00:20:10.747
As a reminder, this is part one of a three-part mini-series on controversial sportspeople.

00:20:11.158 --> 00:20:15.198
Next up is going to be Tonya Harding, the figure skating would-be

00:20:15.198 --> 00:20:19.888
champion, and after that will be Lance Armstrong, the champion cyclist.

00:20:20.516 --> 00:20:24.916
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:25.376 --> 00:20:30.436
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:09.904
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:12.024
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:13.894
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:16.324
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:18.424
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:20.714
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.244 --> 00:00:23.574
I'm Alastair Budge, and today it

00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:25.734
is part three of our three-part

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.594
mini-series on European dictators.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:30.934
In part one it was the

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.704
Grey Blur, Joseph Stalin.

00:00:33.214 --> 00:00:34.824
In part two, it was Il

00:00:34.844 --> 00:00:36.539
Duce, Benito Mussolini.

00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:39.404
And in part three, well you

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:40.754
could probably guess, it is

00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:42.644
the most infamous of them all.

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:44.454
The man most synonymous with

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:46.624
fascism, and the fascist with the

00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:48.860
most warped of all the worldviews.

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:52.044
A man who almost conquered Europe, and

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:55.274
whose genocidal rage left millions dead.

00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.484
The Führer - Adolf Hitler, a man

00:00:58.594 --> 00:01:01.024
whose name alone is enough to send

00:01:01.024 --> 00:01:03.304
shudders down the spines of hundreds

00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:05.244
of millions of people around the world.

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:08.164
Now, obviously it would be incredibly

00:01:08.164 --> 00:01:10.354
difficult to give a thorough account of

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:13.034
Hitler’s entire life, and it certainly

00:01:13.144 --> 00:01:14.654
wouldn't be possible in this episode.

00:01:15.044 --> 00:01:17.164
So today, I'm not going to be going

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.194
into detail with a blow-by-blow

00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:21.044
account of the Second World War,

00:01:21.044 --> 00:01:22.994
or the horrors of the Holocaust.

00:01:23.214 --> 00:01:25.374
I’ll give a broad overview of Hitler,

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.264
focusing on his rise and the key events

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:30.734
in his life, but also some insight

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:33.344
into the lesser known stuff - who

00:01:33.584 --> 00:01:35.874
Hitler really was as a man, and some

00:01:35.964 --> 00:01:37.764
of the more unusual things about him.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:40.794
OK then, let’s get right into

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:43.134
it and talk about Adolf Hitler.

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:47.524
On the 30th of April, 1945, the

00:01:47.534 --> 00:01:49.864
Third Reich was in its final hours.

00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:54.154
Gunfire and explosions filled the air.

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:56.794
Berlin was burning, the

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.384
streets a battlezone.

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:01.784
Waves of Soviet Red Army

00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:04.084
soldiers poured into the city.

00:02:04.884 --> 00:02:07.254
But they weren't hoping just to deliver

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:10.284
the decisive blow and finally end the

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:12.854
war that had destroyed Europe for five

00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:14.904
years - they were looking for someone.

00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:19.024
Nazi Germany’s leader, the Führer, Adolf

00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:22.434
Hitler, hid in a secret underground bunker

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:25.564
16 metres beneath the German chancellery.

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:27.694
The Führerbunker, as

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:28.584
it was known in German.

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:31.744
Actually, it wasn’t a bunker so much

00:02:31.914 --> 00:02:34.854
as it was a complex that contained 18

00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:37.684
rooms and was fully self-sufficient,

00:02:37.814 --> 00:02:40.364
with its own water and electrical supply.

00:02:41.414 --> 00:02:43.294
As the Soviets advanced through

00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:45.864
Berlin street by street, getting

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.244
closer to the Führerbunker, Hitler

00:02:48.394 --> 00:02:50.584
continued to give orders and hold

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:52.864
meetings with high-ranking Nazis.

00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:56.774
The day before, on April the 29th, he

00:02:56.774 --> 00:02:58.664
had married his long-time mistress,

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:01.284
Eva Braun, and put together his will

00:03:01.284 --> 00:03:04.374
and political testament outlining who

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.414
he wanted to take over when he died.

00:03:07.284 --> 00:03:09.674
But when, and how, would that be?

00:03:10.274 --> 00:03:11.804
Was he sure that the Soviets would

00:03:11.994 --> 00:03:14.344
capture, and likely torture and kill him?

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:17.144
Or was it the news of his ally

00:03:17.144 --> 00:03:18.774
Benito Mussolini’s gruesome

00:03:18.774 --> 00:03:20.654
death just hours before that

00:03:20.774 --> 00:03:22.524
convinced him to do something else?

00:03:24.074 --> 00:03:25.854
After putting his affairs in order,

00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:28.924
on the afternoon of the 30th, Hitler

00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:32.254
enjoyed his last lunch, shook hands with

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:34.944
his staff, and retired to his private

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:37.274
quarters of the complex with Eva Braun.

00:03:38.674 --> 00:03:41.094
Sometime that afternoon, Adolf Hitler,

00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:43.664
the man who destroyed mainland Europe

00:03:43.764 --> 00:03:46.264
and organised the slaughter of millions

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:49.074
of Jews, sat down on his sofa with his

00:03:49.074 --> 00:03:51.884
new wife and swallowed a cyanide capsule.

00:03:52.874 --> 00:03:55.454
To make sure, he shot himself in the head.

00:03:56.314 --> 00:03:57.624
The Führer was dead.

00:03:58.514 --> 00:04:00.603
As the Red Army closed in, Hitler

00:04:00.603 --> 00:04:02.074
and Braun’s bodies were quickly

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:04.514
cremated, or burned, in the garden.

00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:07.724
And just eight days later, on the 8th

00:04:07.864 --> 00:04:11.214
of May, 1945, the Germans surrendered.

00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:14.814
Much like the subjects of part

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:16.754
one and two of this mini-series,

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:18.474
it didn’t have to be this way.

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:21.484
Adolf Hitler was born on the 20th

00:04:21.684 --> 00:04:25.464
of April, 1889, in Braunau am Inn, a

00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:28.554
small town in modern day Austria, then

00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:30.444
part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.354
He was the fourth of six children born

00:04:33.354 --> 00:04:36.624
to Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl, though

00:04:36.764 --> 00:04:39.424
three of his siblings died in infancy.

00:04:40.254 --> 00:04:42.594
Both his parents came from poor

00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:44.664
peasant backgrounds, but by the

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:46.254
time they were married and had

00:04:46.254 --> 00:04:47.904
started a family, they lived a

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.424
comfortable middle class existence.

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.189
His father Alois was a customs official,

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.619
a civil servant, and his mother,

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.709
Klara, a housewife and devout Catholic.

00:05:00.739 --> 00:05:02.869
His father was said to be harsh and

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:05.029
distant with the children, but his

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.109
mother was more loving towards them.

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:10.699
When Hitler was just three years old,

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:13.269
the family moved to Passau, in Germany,

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:15.509
and it is thought that Hitler picked up

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:18.089
his distinctive Bavarian dialect there.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.149
The family returned to Austria in

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:24.709
1894, and Hitler attended Volksschule,

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.749
a state-funded primary school.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.199
Though the young Hitler was clearly

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:32.829
able, or intelligent, he showed

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:35.319
little interest in education and left

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.639
school with a poor academic record.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.599
He had a tense, difficult,

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:41.889
relationship with his father,

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:44.239
who wanted him to follow in his

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:46.729
footsteps and become a civil servant.

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:50.499
In fact, Alois Hitler was a violent man

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:53.549
who beat his children, and Hitler’s mother

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:56.009
often intervened to try and protect them.

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:00.339
In 1900 his younger brother Edmund

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:02.929
died from measles, and his brother, the

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:05.849
11-year-old Adolf, became an increasingly

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.479
quiet, detached boy who got into

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:10.379
conflicts with his father and teachers.

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:14.049
But when his father died suddenly on

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:17.199
the 3rd of January in 1903, when Hitler

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.239
was 13 years old, his mother allowed

00:06:20.239 --> 00:06:22.489
him to change schools and forget

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.549
about a career in the civil service.

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:27.509
The young Hitler was able to study

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:30.099
what he really wanted to, art, and

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:32.509
he moved to art school and began to

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:34.709
think of himself as a bit of an artist.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:38.939
In 1907, when he was 18 years old, he

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:41.439
moved to Vienna, filled with dreams

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:43.439
of winning a place at the Vienna

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:45.949
Academy of Art, but he was rejected.

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.969
Traditionally, historical accounts

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.369
of Hitler’s time in Vienna depict him

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:54.429
as a struggling artist with no income

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:56.609
that moved from hostel to hostel.

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:58.429
But the truth wasn’t

00:06:58.529 --> 00:06:59.649
quite as simple as that.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.069
After all, his father had been a civil

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.549
servant, he came from a middle-class

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:08.649
family, and so he was by no means poor.

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:11.469
It’s thought that he blew through, he

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:14.079
got through, quite a large inheritance

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.759
while he tried to make it as an artist.

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:20.219
By the end of 1909, however, he

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.339
was genuinely running out of money.

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.989
He sold postcards and drawings to survive,

00:07:26.209 --> 00:07:29.289
but even then, one of his aunts introduced

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.519
him to a wealthy business partner and

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:34.159
he was paid to paint watercolour scenes.

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:37.279
Now, believe it or not, one of Hitler’s

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:41.109
watercolours sold for €130,000 at an

00:07:41.239 --> 00:07:43.959
auction in Nuremberg back in 2014.

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:48.219
The price tag, it has to be said, comes

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:50.559
from the subsequent reputation of the

00:07:50.559 --> 00:07:52.459
man who held the paintbrush rather than

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:54.829
the artistic quality of the canvas.

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:58.289
And back in Vienna his paintings

00:07:58.459 --> 00:08:00.119
weren’t worth quite that much,

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:02.549
but the watercolours earned Hitler

00:08:02.679 --> 00:08:04.969
enough money to live, to survive.

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:08.089
Like many young Austrians at the time,

00:08:08.369 --> 00:08:10.619
Hitler identified strongly with a sense

00:08:10.619 --> 00:08:13.129
of German identity and he likely shared

00:08:13.199 --> 00:08:15.589
the “casual” anti-semitism that was

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:17.729
common to middle-class German nationalism.

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:20.929
However, Hitler probably had business

00:08:20.929 --> 00:08:23.589
and personal relationships with Jews

00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:26.299
in Vienna, and his anti-semitism in

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:29.209
those early days was likely a reflection

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:32.079
of the general anti-semitism common

00:08:32.249 --> 00:08:34.409
in society at the time - that is to

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.019
say, still completely unacceptable by

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:39.359
any standards, but nothing like the

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.119
genocidal anti-semitic ideology he

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:43.895
developed after the First World War.

00:08:45.475 --> 00:08:48.809
And in 1913 he moved to Munich, in

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:51.069
southern Germany, to avoid military

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:52.889
service for the Habsburg Empire.

00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:56.079
This was made possible due to another

00:08:56.099 --> 00:08:58.769
inheritance from his father’s estate, and

00:08:58.949 --> 00:09:01.549
in Munich Hitler’s life largely continued

00:09:01.709 --> 00:09:04.269
as it had in Vienna - drifting around,

00:09:04.499 --> 00:09:07.219
surviving on paintings and postcards.

00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:10.029
That is, of course, until the following

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:13.773
year, 1914, when world events changed

00:09:13.873 --> 00:09:15.633
not only Hitler’s life but the

00:09:15.633 --> 00:09:17.793
direction of European history forever.

00:09:18.813 --> 00:09:20.463
When the First World War began,

00:09:20.773 --> 00:09:22.623
Hitler volunteered for service

00:09:22.633 --> 00:09:24.673
in the German army and joined the

00:09:24.673 --> 00:09:27.443
16th Bavarian Infantry Regiment.

00:09:28.183 --> 00:09:30.453
He served as a runner on the Western

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.143
Front - a particularly dangerous job

00:09:33.243 --> 00:09:35.543
that involved passing messages between

00:09:35.543 --> 00:09:37.313
different army units on the front

00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:40.783
line - and he was awarded an Iron Cross.

00:09:41.973 --> 00:09:44.063
At the time of the armistice, when

00:09:44.063 --> 00:09:46.393
the First World War officially ended,

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:48.803
Hitler was in hospital with temporary

00:09:48.813 --> 00:09:51.633
blindness caused by a British gas attack.

00:09:52.853 --> 00:09:55.703
Keen to stay in the army even after

00:09:55.703 --> 00:09:57.603
the war had ended, Hitler joined the

00:09:57.613 --> 00:09:59.583
Intelligence and Propaganda section

00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:01.813
where he had his first political

00:10:01.813 --> 00:10:05.103
training, and became an army informer,

00:10:05.453 --> 00:10:08.113
spying on smaller political parties.

00:10:08.913 --> 00:10:10.673
He made speeches to the troops

00:10:10.873 --> 00:10:13.193
championing German nationalism and

00:10:13.443 --> 00:10:15.753
anti-Socialism, and developed his

00:10:15.935 --> 00:10:18.293
oratory, his public speaking, skills.

00:10:19.343 --> 00:10:22.423
In 1919 he also joined the German

00:10:22.433 --> 00:10:24.663
Workers’ Party, a far-right,

00:10:24.863 --> 00:10:27.573
anti-semitic, anti-communist organisation.

00:10:28.813 --> 00:10:31.853
When he left the army in 1920, he took

00:10:31.873 --> 00:10:34.423
over the publicity and propaganda for the

00:10:34.483 --> 00:10:37.113
German Workers’ Party and he changed the

00:10:37.113 --> 00:10:39.983
party’s name to the National Socialist

00:10:40.103 --> 00:10:42.653
German Workers Party - Nazi for short.

00:10:44.003 --> 00:10:48.103
A year later, in 1921, he challenged Anton

00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:50.133
Drexler for the leadership of the Nazi

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:53.003
party, and eventually Drexler agreed.

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.399
A couple of years later, on the 8th

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.929
of November 1923, Hitler and the Nazis

00:10:59.949 --> 00:11:01.769
attempted to overthrow the Bavarian

00:11:01.789 --> 00:11:03.919
government in a coup d'état that

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:06.295
became known as the Beer Hall Putsch.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.799
After being inspired by Benito Mussolini’s

00:11:09.809 --> 00:11:12.579
‘March on Rome’ the year before, Hitler

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:15.689
and 2,000 Nazis marched through Munich

00:11:15.749 --> 00:11:17.959
to the Beer Hall, determind to take

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.799
over a meeting chaired by important

00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:21.949
figures in Bavarian politics and

00:11:22.219 --> 00:11:24.609
ultimately to overthrow the government.

00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:28.709
However, unlike Mussolini, who was one

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:31.179
of his early political heroes and the

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:33.599
man many consider to be the father of

00:11:33.599 --> 00:11:36.138
fascism, Hitler’s coup didn’t work.

00:11:37.219 --> 00:11:39.729
The next day as Nazis marched in

00:11:39.729 --> 00:11:41.759
the streets, police open fire.

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:45.509
Hitler managed to escape but was captured

00:11:45.599 --> 00:11:48.389
and served 9 months in Landsberg prison.

00:11:49.489 --> 00:11:51.759
Now, while in prison, he wrote

00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:53.659
his famous autobiographical

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:56.119
book of political ideology, Mein

00:11:56.119 --> 00:11:58.349
Kampf - or my struggle, in English.

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:01.649
But what many people don’t know is

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:03.869
that Hitler didn’t actually write

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:05.979
the book himself, or at least he

00:12:05.979 --> 00:12:08.599
wasn’t sitting down at a desk writing

00:12:08.599 --> 00:12:10.779
it down on endless sheets of paper.

00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:13.929
Rather, he paced around his cell

00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:16.289
and dictated it - meaning, he said

00:12:16.289 --> 00:12:18.979
it out loud - to Rudolf Hess, the

00:12:19.099 --> 00:12:21.489
man who would later rise the Nazi

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:23.949
ranks to become the Deputy Führer.

00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:28.239
As you probably know, in Mein Kampf Hitler

00:12:28.519 --> 00:12:31.699
expanded on, or explained, his twisted

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:35.069
theories on race and ethnic “purity”

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:38.099
- that there was a racial hierarchy and

00:12:38.099 --> 00:12:40.979
the so-called “Aryan race” was superior.

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:44.969
In order for the Aryan race to fulfil

00:12:44.969 --> 00:12:47.679
its destiny, Hitler’s logic went, they

00:12:47.679 --> 00:12:50.295
would need Lebensraum [or living space].

00:12:51.365 --> 00:12:53.785
Germany must, he wrote, invade the

00:12:53.785 --> 00:12:55.955
land to the east occupied by the

00:12:56.305 --> 00:12:59.121
“inferior” Slavic peoples including the

00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:01.435
Sudetenland [or the Czech Republic as

00:13:01.435 --> 00:13:03.535
it’s now called], Poland and Russia.

00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:07.145
By the time Hitler was released from

00:13:07.145 --> 00:13:09.735
prison, the German economy had picked

00:13:09.735 --> 00:13:12.355
up, or improved a little, after a

00:13:12.355 --> 00:13:14.505
period of terrible economic growth

00:13:14.555 --> 00:13:17.075
and hyperinflation, and support

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:19.475
for more extreme right-wing groups

00:13:19.515 --> 00:13:21.725
like the Nazis began to die down.

00:13:22.925 --> 00:13:25.255
As Germans began to trust the

00:13:25.255 --> 00:13:27.515
Weimar Republic again, Hitler got

00:13:27.545 --> 00:13:29.975
to work reorganising the Nazi Party.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:34.535
In 1925 he established the Hitler Youth

00:13:34.645 --> 00:13:37.315
to organise youngsters, and created

00:13:37.315 --> 00:13:40.395
the Schutzstaffel - known as the SS,

00:13:40.395 --> 00:13:42.735
his own paramilitary organisation.

00:13:44.205 --> 00:13:47.435
Members of the SS wore black uniforms

00:13:47.585 --> 00:13:50.105
- which was likely inspired by Mussolini’s

00:13:50.105 --> 00:13:52.245
blackshirts - and they swore a

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:54.585
personal oath of loyalty to Hitler.

00:13:55.825 --> 00:13:58.095
Over the next couple of years the Nazi

00:13:58.095 --> 00:14:00.585
party was banned several times, but

00:14:00.755 --> 00:14:03.845
continued to ramp up, to increase its

00:14:04.065 --> 00:14:06.785
anti-semitic and anti-communist rhetoric.

00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:09.905
After the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the

00:14:10.075 --> 00:14:12.825
Nazi party would, Hitler promised, win

00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:15.595
power through democratic means, and in the

00:14:15.595 --> 00:14:18.835
late-1920s the Nazi party began building

00:14:18.835 --> 00:14:21.535
up its propaganda machine and tried to

00:14:21.535 --> 00:14:23.665
establish a base in northern Germany.

00:14:24.725 --> 00:14:26.845
Now, it’s around this time that things

00:14:26.855 --> 00:14:28.885
start to get a little strange in

00:14:28.905 --> 00:14:30.855
Hitler’s personal life, and there’s

00:14:30.855 --> 00:14:32.785
even a hint of murder mystery.

00:14:34.239 --> 00:14:37.399
In 1928, Hitler’s half-sister,

00:14:37.809 --> 00:14:39.919
Angela Raubal, and her daughter

00:14:40.119 --> 00:14:42.429
Geli, moved into Hitler's home.

00:14:43.419 --> 00:14:45.876
Hitler, who was 19 years older than

00:14:45.876 --> 00:14:48.526
his half-niece, developed something of

00:14:49.116 --> 00:14:51.126
an obsessive relationship with Geli.

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.356
He was so obsessive that historians have

00:14:54.356 --> 00:14:56.816
debated for decades, and it has been

00:14:56.926 --> 00:14:59.526
strongly implied, or suggested, that

00:14:59.696 --> 00:15:02.076
their relationship was a romantic one.

00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:05.566
Whatever the truth, historians

00:15:05.566 --> 00:15:07.476
have described Geli as “the only

00:15:07.536 --> 00:15:09.506
true deep love affair of his life.”

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:12.386
And as if that wasn’t strange

00:15:12.386 --> 00:15:14.806
enough, Hitler’s obsessiveness had

00:15:14.966 --> 00:15:17.356
tragic, and deadly consequences.

00:15:18.486 --> 00:15:21.026
On the 18th of September, 1931,

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.876
at the age of 23, Geli was

00:15:23.876 --> 00:15:25.966
found dead in the apartment she

00:15:25.966 --> 00:15:27.536
shared with Hitler in Munich.

00:15:28.686 --> 00:15:30.636
By her side was Hitler’s pistol.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.076
But what had happened?

00:15:33.466 --> 00:15:35.996
Well, the official version of events

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:38.816
was that Hitler and Geli had argued

00:15:38.966 --> 00:15:41.186
over her plans to go to Vienna, and

00:15:41.346 --> 00:15:43.636
that after Hitler had refused to let

00:15:43.636 --> 00:15:45.836
her leave, she committed suicide.

00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:48.226
But it’s a little more

00:15:48.396 --> 00:15:49.436
mysterious than that.

00:15:50.306 --> 00:15:53.076
At the time, the Munich press reported

00:15:53.076 --> 00:15:55.516
that Geli’s nose was shattered, and

00:15:55.676 --> 00:15:57.796
that she had other injuries to her body.

00:15:58.596 --> 00:16:00.196
Had he killed the young girl?

00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:04.396
Now, we must remember that in 1931 Hitler

00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:06.836
was on the cusp of political power.

00:16:07.486 --> 00:16:09.486
The 1929 Wall St.

00:16:09.486 --> 00:16:12.676
Crash had plunged the Weimar economy back

00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:15.406
into crisis, and the political landscape

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:19.096
was ripe, it was ready, for extreme views.

00:16:19.766 --> 00:16:22.206
Hitler wanted to take advantage of this,

00:16:22.376 --> 00:16:24.896
and a murder scandal would have likely

00:16:24.906 --> 00:16:27.456
ruined his career and rise to power.

00:16:28.536 --> 00:16:31.056
In fact, we now know that Nazi officials

00:16:31.306 --> 00:16:33.926
even discussed a replacement for Hitler,

00:16:34.086 --> 00:16:36.256
should the scandal get out of hand.

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:39.136
So it’s little surprise, therefore,

00:16:39.356 --> 00:16:41.896
that the Nazi party pressued

00:16:41.896 --> 00:16:43.976
the public prosecutor not to

00:16:43.976 --> 00:16:46.096
investigate, and that Geli’s body

00:16:46.096 --> 00:16:48.036
was given a very quick post-mortem.

00:16:49.066 --> 00:16:50.956
The incident was quickly ruled

00:16:51.336 --> 00:16:53.776
suicide, and Geli’s body was taken

00:16:53.786 --> 00:16:55.516
down the back stairs of the police

00:16:55.516 --> 00:16:57.846
station and taken to Vienna to be

00:16:57.846 --> 00:16:59.956
buried before the press even got wind

00:16:59.956 --> 00:17:01.706
of it, before they heard the news.

00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:05.446
Very mysterious indeed - and one can’t

00:17:05.456 --> 00:17:07.736
help but wonder how different Hitler’s

00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:10.486
career and German and European history

00:17:10.756 --> 00:17:12.536
would have been if there had been a proper

00:17:12.546 --> 00:17:14.809
investigation into Geli Raubal’s death.

00:17:15.899 --> 00:17:18.156
Now, regardless of what happened, the

00:17:18.336 --> 00:17:21.076
incident sent Hitler into a depression

00:17:21.076 --> 00:17:23.056
so bad that one historian believes

00:17:23.106 --> 00:17:25.256
that “With the exception of his

00:17:25.256 --> 00:17:27.836
mother’s death… no other event in his

00:17:27.836 --> 00:17:29.736
personal life had hit him so hard.”

00:17:30.986 --> 00:17:33.206
Clearly, it’s hard to have any compassion

00:17:33.206 --> 00:17:35.416
for the man, when one knows what he would

00:17:35.416 --> 00:17:37.996
go on to do, and this event wouldn’t have

00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:40.876
any effect on his political career, as his

00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:43.416
Nazi party continued its rise to power.

00:17:44.956 --> 00:17:46.756
Around a year before Geli’s death,

00:17:46.906 --> 00:17:50.366
in September of 1930, the Nazi party

00:17:50.496 --> 00:17:53.046
had enjoyed large electoral gains and

00:17:53.156 --> 00:17:54.966
increased its number of representatives

00:17:54.966 --> 00:17:58.426
in parliament from 14 to 107, making

00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:00.246
Hitler the leader of the second

00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:02.106
biggest political party in Germany.

00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:06.266
In 1932 Hitler came second in the

00:18:06.506 --> 00:18:08.406
presidential elections, and the

00:18:08.406 --> 00:18:10.646
Nazis were firmly established in the

00:18:10.646 --> 00:18:12.536
political mainstream - benefitting

00:18:12.536 --> 00:18:15.166
from political instability and another

00:18:15.176 --> 00:18:17.726
spike, or increase, in unemployment.

00:18:18.496 --> 00:18:20.926
In July of that year the Nazis became the

00:18:21.076 --> 00:18:23.966
largest party in the Reichstag, and after

00:18:24.086 --> 00:18:26.296
political negotiating and maneuvering

00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:28.926
throughout the rest of 1932, Hitler

00:18:29.126 --> 00:18:32.836
emerged as Chancellor in January of 1933.

00:18:34.156 --> 00:18:36.876
The Nazis now had a third of the seats

00:18:36.906 --> 00:18:39.206
in the Reichstag, and with more elections

00:18:39.226 --> 00:18:42.126
coming up in Feburary of 1933, the

00:18:42.146 --> 00:18:44.956
German Reichstag was destroyed by a fire.

00:18:46.186 --> 00:18:48.556
Now, historians are almost certain that

00:18:48.556 --> 00:18:51.266
the Nazis organised the blaze, but the

00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.636
fire allowed them to blame the Communists

00:18:53.636 --> 00:18:55.726
and tighten their grip on power.

00:18:57.104 --> 00:18:59.544
And Hitler wasted no time.

00:19:00.164 --> 00:19:02.674
The Enabling Act, which was passed in

00:19:02.784 --> 00:19:06.254
March 1933, effectively made Hitler

00:19:06.374 --> 00:19:08.854
a dictator, and all other political

00:19:08.854 --> 00:19:11.084
parties and trade unions were banned.

00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:14.374
Adolf Hitler, the shy Austrian

00:19:14.374 --> 00:19:15.864
boy who painted watercolours,

00:19:16.014 --> 00:19:18.184
had risen to the very top of

00:19:18.184 --> 00:19:20.224
German politics and stolen power.

00:19:21.044 --> 00:19:23.824
And he had ambitious, deadly plans.

00:19:25.304 --> 00:19:28.854
Now, clearly the 1930s and lead up

00:19:28.924 --> 00:19:30.844
to the Second World War was a period

00:19:30.844 --> 00:19:33.214
of intense activity, far too much

00:19:33.384 --> 00:19:35.844
to do justice to here, so we are

00:19:35.844 --> 00:19:37.944
going to skip over the key events.

00:19:38.524 --> 00:19:40.324
Instead, we’ll deal with a couple

00:19:40.324 --> 00:19:41.954
of interesting points about

00:19:42.044 --> 00:19:43.964
Hitler the man from this period.

00:19:44.604 --> 00:19:47.534
One is an assassination attempt, and the

00:19:47.534 --> 00:19:50.254
other a theory about Hitler’s drug use.

00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:54.304
The most important thing to underline

00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:56.064
about Hitler’s foreign policy during

00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:58.794
the 1930s was that he was immediately

00:19:58.894 --> 00:20:01.164
on a war footing - that is to say,

00:20:01.164 --> 00:20:03.304
he was preparing Germany for war.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:08.114
In October of 1933 Hitler withdrew

00:20:08.124 --> 00:20:09.744
Germany from the League of Nations

00:20:09.844 --> 00:20:12.444
and cast aside, or ignored, the

00:20:12.444 --> 00:20:14.154
restrictions placed on the German

00:20:14.154 --> 00:20:15.834
military by the Treaty of Versailles

00:20:16.254 --> 00:20:18.444
and he tripled the size of the army.

00:20:19.194 --> 00:20:22.804
In June of 1934, he further tightened his

00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:25.754
grip on the Nazi party and eliminated his

00:20:25.754 --> 00:20:28.214
remaining enemies with a move that became

00:20:28.214 --> 00:20:30.604
known as the Night of the Long Knives.

00:20:32.075 --> 00:20:36.125
In 1935 he began rearming Germany and

00:20:36.295 --> 00:20:38.415
military conscription was introduced.

00:20:39.225 --> 00:20:41.495
Hitler, it became clear to everyone

00:20:41.525 --> 00:20:43.675
across Europe, was ready for war.

00:20:44.935 --> 00:20:47.385
Domestically, he was also setting the

00:20:47.385 --> 00:20:50.055
wheels in motion for his mass-persecution

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:52.885
of Jews, homosexuals, Roma, and

00:20:53.065 --> 00:20:55.255
anyone who didn’t fit into his idea

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:57.685
of the perfect “Aryan” society.

00:20:58.495 --> 00:21:01.805
In November of 1938, the infamous

00:21:02.005 --> 00:21:04.515
Kristallnacht took place across Germany.

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:08.125
Jewish shops and synagogues were burnt

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:11.975
down, and 30,000 Jewish men were rounded

00:21:11.975 --> 00:21:14.315
up and taken to concentration camps.

00:21:15.385 --> 00:21:17.235
This was just the start of what would

00:21:17.235 --> 00:21:19.135
have become known as the the Holocaust,

00:21:19.325 --> 00:21:21.485
which is clearly far too important

00:21:21.485 --> 00:21:23.695
a subject to try to do justice to

00:21:23.835 --> 00:21:25.995
in a short section of this episode.

00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:29.995
Internationally, he was itching for war.

00:21:30.985 --> 00:21:33.045
Despite signing agreements not

00:21:33.055 --> 00:21:34.955
to, he sent his army abroad.

00:21:35.665 --> 00:21:37.555
Nazi forces occupied part

00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:39.155
of modern day Czech Republic

00:21:39.215 --> 00:21:41.765
called the Sudetenland, in 1938.

00:21:42.425 --> 00:21:45.715
And then in September 1939 Germany

00:21:45.755 --> 00:21:48.155
invaded Poland, which resulted in

00:21:48.155 --> 00:21:50.345
a full declaration of war between

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:52.325
the UK and France on Germany.

00:21:53.715 --> 00:21:56.685
The Nazis went on to occupy Denmark,

00:21:56.835 --> 00:21:59.305
Norway, Holland, Belgium, France,

00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:03.225
Romania and Yugoslavia, and in 1941

00:22:03.305 --> 00:22:06.265
they invaded Russia - a mistake that

00:22:06.265 --> 00:22:08.045
would prove to be the beginning of

00:22:08.045 --> 00:22:10.135
the end for the Nazis, and Hitler.

00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:13.735
Now, as we heard in part one, on Stalin,

00:22:14.075 --> 00:22:16.765
after sacrificing as many as a million men

00:22:16.945 --> 00:22:19.605
at the Battle of Stalingrad, the Soviets

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:22.025
pushed the Germans all the way back to

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:25.285
Berlin and the Führerbunker in 1945.

00:22:26.555 --> 00:22:29.288
Now, the details of the war and the

00:22:29.288 --> 00:22:31.768
Holocaust are well-known, but I want

00:22:31.778 --> 00:22:33.618
to touch on two elements of life

00:22:33.778 --> 00:22:35.738
within Hitler’s personal circle.

00:22:36.828 --> 00:22:39.648
As Hitler’s genocidal rage wreaked havoc

00:22:39.738 --> 00:22:41.818
across Europe, killing millions and

00:22:41.938 --> 00:22:45.018
slaughtering Jews, some in the Nazi party

00:22:45.028 --> 00:22:47.458
thoughts things - and Hitler specifically

00:22:47.598 --> 00:22:49.738
- were getting a bit out of control.

00:22:50.978 --> 00:22:54.908
That’s why, in July of 1944, a German

00:22:54.978 --> 00:22:57.748
Army officer named Claus Von Stauffenberg

00:22:57.758 --> 00:23:00.118
placed a bomb in a briefcase under a

00:23:00.118 --> 00:23:02.338
table in Hitler’s headquarters, with the

00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:05.188
aim of blowing the man to smithereens.

00:23:06.248 --> 00:23:08.188
During a meeting between Hitler and

00:23:08.188 --> 00:23:11.408
top Nazis, the bomb exploded, killing

00:23:11.408 --> 00:23:13.938
one person, but Hitler survived.

00:23:15.308 --> 00:23:17.868
As you might expect, Hitler purged

00:23:17.878 --> 00:23:20.138
the party of anyone even remotely

00:23:20.138 --> 00:23:21.558
suspected of being involved.

00:23:22.798 --> 00:23:24.978
Though the assassination attempt, which

00:23:25.088 --> 00:23:27.238
became known as Operation Valkyrie,

00:23:27.438 --> 00:23:29.408
wasn’t successful, it highlights the

00:23:29.408 --> 00:23:31.358
fact that there were those in the Nazi

00:23:31.358 --> 00:23:34.368
party that felt Hitler had lost control.

00:23:35.778 --> 00:23:37.748
Now, why might that be?

00:23:38.168 --> 00:23:40.098
Well, the obvious answer is that

00:23:40.108 --> 00:23:42.328
he was clearly a brutal genocidal

00:23:42.328 --> 00:23:45.108
maniac, but in recent years another

00:23:45.158 --> 00:23:47.038
interesting theory about Hitler has

00:23:47.038 --> 00:23:50.068
emerged, and it concerns his drug use.

00:23:50.678 --> 00:23:52.718
Was the Führer a drug addict?

00:23:53.708 --> 00:23:58.242
In autumn of 1941 as the war began to turn

00:23:58.242 --> 00:24:01.068
against the Nazis, Hitler had fallen ill.

00:24:01.728 --> 00:24:04.328
He was so ill, in fact, that he couldn't

00:24:04.338 --> 00:24:06.428
go to a military briefing - this

00:24:06.428 --> 00:24:08.118
was something that never happened.

00:24:09.248 --> 00:24:11.308
That day, his doctor gave

00:24:11.308 --> 00:24:13.048
him an opiate and a hormone

00:24:13.048 --> 00:24:14.648
injection for the first time.

00:24:15.818 --> 00:24:18.278
Unsurprisingly, Hitler felt much better

00:24:18.578 --> 00:24:21.038
and he was able to attend the briefing.

00:24:21.898 --> 00:24:23.768
And he was very impressed by

00:24:23.768 --> 00:24:26.458
this magical recovery drug, which

00:24:26.458 --> 00:24:27.915
was an opiate called Dolantin.

00:24:29.235 --> 00:24:31.785
From then on, Hitler asked his doctor

00:24:31.785 --> 00:24:34.845
for more and more of it, and between

00:24:34.845 --> 00:24:39.005
1941 and the winter of 1944 Hitler's

00:24:39.185 --> 00:24:41.705
drug abuse increased massively,

00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:43.905
with him reportedly relying on a

00:24:43.945 --> 00:24:46.265
cocktail of opiates and cocaine.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.635
His dependence got so bad, in fact, that

00:24:49.635 --> 00:24:52.775
he developed a severe tremor, or shake.

00:24:53.405 --> 00:24:55.405
You can actually see this if you look at

00:24:55.405 --> 00:24:58.335
footage of Hitler in the latter stages of

00:24:58.335 --> 00:25:01.375
the war, where his hands and entire body

00:25:01.425 --> 00:25:04.325
are shaking so violently that even the

00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:06.645
Nazi propaganda machine couldn’t hide it.

00:25:08.225 --> 00:25:10.025
Some historians believe that Hitler

00:25:10.215 --> 00:25:11.915
could have been suffering from

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:14.755
Parkinson's disease, but severe tremors

00:25:14.755 --> 00:25:16.945
are also a symptom of drug withdrawal.

00:25:18.015 --> 00:25:20.485
We already know that some Nazis felt

00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:22.765
Hitler was out of control, but was

00:25:22.765 --> 00:25:24.925
this partly down to drug addiction?

00:25:25.355 --> 00:25:27.655
Was he making war decisions while

00:25:27.835 --> 00:25:29.715
high on cocaine and opiates?

00:25:30.435 --> 00:25:32.695
It’s certainly an interesting theory,

00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:35.455
and could partly explain Hitler’s

00:25:35.625 --> 00:25:38.105
manic behaviour and refusal to stop the

00:25:38.105 --> 00:25:40.105
war until the last moment, preferring

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:42.625
to destroy Europe than make peace.

00:25:43.465 --> 00:25:45.115
There are clearly many other reasons

00:25:45.125 --> 00:25:47.745
for his behaviour and downfall, and

00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:49.645
one that I should mention is his

00:25:49.775 --> 00:25:52.495
extreme paranoia and his refusal to

00:25:52.515 --> 00:25:54.575
trust his generals to make military

00:25:54.575 --> 00:25:56.655
decisions without consulting him first.

00:25:57.365 --> 00:25:59.825
When you are fighting literally a world

00:25:59.825 --> 00:26:02.245
war, you can’t do everything yourself, and

00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:04.765
this is believed to be a major reason why

00:26:04.765 --> 00:26:06.995
the German army was eventually defeated.

00:26:07.985 --> 00:26:10.265
So, all of this takes us

00:26:10.265 --> 00:26:12.765
back to Berlin, in 1945.

00:26:13.595 --> 00:26:16.195
In January the Soviets began

00:26:16.195 --> 00:26:18.335
their assault on Germany, and

00:26:18.465 --> 00:26:20.225
by April they reached Berlin.

00:26:21.395 --> 00:26:23.265
As we know from the start of this

00:26:23.275 --> 00:26:25.735
episode, Hitler stayed in the

00:26:25.735 --> 00:26:27.505
Führerbunker until the very end.

00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:29.925
After hearing of Mussolini’s

00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:32.015
gruesome end, with the Soviets

00:26:32.185 --> 00:26:34.485
just streets away, Hitler committed

00:26:34.485 --> 00:26:37.707
suicide on the 30th of April, 1945.

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:41.505
Adolf Hitler, the man whose name has

00:26:41.505 --> 00:26:44.405
become synonymous with evil, was dead.

00:26:45.575 --> 00:26:47.705
Unlike the subjects of parts one

00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:50.195
and two of this mini-series, Stalin

00:26:50.195 --> 00:26:52.985
and Mussolini, the death of Hitler

00:26:53.275 --> 00:26:56.005
offered more of a clean break with

00:26:56.005 --> 00:26:58.315
the past, an acknowledgment of the

00:26:58.435 --> 00:27:00.625
horrors that had been committed under

00:27:00.625 --> 00:27:03.115
his command, and a shared resolve

00:27:03.135 --> 00:27:05.175
to never allow them to happen again.

00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:10.202
Clearly, as with any warped belief, there

00:27:10.202 --> 00:27:12.102
are still those who look back on this

00:27:12.102 --> 00:27:15.012
man’s life with some form of admiration,

00:27:15.462 --> 00:27:18.662
but for the vast majority of mankind, the

00:27:18.852 --> 00:27:21.122
life of Adolf Hitler is looked back on

00:27:21.122 --> 00:27:24.412
with utter repulsion, hate and disgust.

00:27:25.122 --> 00:27:27.702
He is a man who organised the industrial

00:27:27.702 --> 00:27:30.212
slaughter of at least six million

00:27:30.212 --> 00:27:33.092
Jews, oversaw the deaths of millions of

00:27:33.092 --> 00:27:35.322
soldiers and civilians across Europe,

00:27:35.632 --> 00:27:38.432
and left a deep scar on world history.

00:27:39.162 --> 00:27:42.552
It is a truly vile legacy indeed.

00:27:45.152 --> 00:27:48.132
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on

00:27:48.212 --> 00:27:50.802
Adolf Hitler, and with that comes the end

00:27:50.812 --> 00:27:53.622
of our mini-series on European dictators.

00:27:53.892 --> 00:27:55.212
I hope it was an interesting one,

00:27:55.352 --> 00:27:57.042
and whether you knew a lot about

00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:59.542
Hitler, Stalin or Mussolini, or

00:27:59.642 --> 00:28:01.282
this was the first time you’d really

00:28:01.392 --> 00:28:03.532
dived into their backstories, well

00:28:03.642 --> 00:28:04.832
I hope you learned something new

00:28:05.672 --> 00:28:07.452
As always, I would love to know

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:08.912
what you thought about this episode.

00:28:09.282 --> 00:28:11.302
What particular set of circumstances

00:28:11.512 --> 00:28:13.052
allowed Hitler to come to power?

00:28:13.512 --> 00:28:15.422
Do you think a Hitler-like figure

00:28:15.442 --> 00:28:17.032
could ever come to power again?

00:28:17.812 --> 00:28:20.162
Of the three dictators we’ve discussed

00:28:20.262 --> 00:28:22.022
in our mini-series, who would you say

00:28:22.022 --> 00:28:24.622
was the ‘worst’ or most consequential?

00:28:25.222 --> 00:28:27.162
I would love to know, so let’s

00:28:27.162 --> 00:28:28.582
get this discussion started.

00:28:29.052 --> 00:28:30.042
You can head right into our

00:28:30.042 --> 00:28:31.522
community forum, which is at

00:28:31.522 --> 00:28:34.062
community.leonardoenglish.com and get

00:28:34.062 --> 00:28:36.202
chatting away to other curious minds.

00:28:37.042 --> 00:28:38.742

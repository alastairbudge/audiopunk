Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious

00:00:08.472 --> 00:00:13.572
Minds by Leonardo English, the show where you can learn fascinating things about the

00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:19.662
world and listen to interesting stories at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:21.642
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:26.652
Today we are going to be talking about Fox News.

00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:31.062
It is one of the most powerful TV channels in the

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:36.342
United States and the preferred TV channel of the current US president.

00:00:37.046 --> 00:00:41.666
And it's like Marmite, people either love it or they hate it.

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:46.029
Indeed, four out of 10 Americans say they

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:50.109
trust it and about the same say that they distrust it.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.488
So today we are going to talk about how it all works, who is behind

00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:04.268
Fox News, what their motives may be, how Fox News really makes money and what the

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:10.808
implications of this might be for the future of Fox News and how we think about the media.

00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:13.044
It's going to be quite an exciting one.

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:13.554
I think.

00:01:14.714 --> 00:01:18.931
Before we get into all that though, let me just take a minute to remind

00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:24.961
you that you can get a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this episode and

00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.891
all the other episodes for that matter over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:34.891
The transcript and key vocabulary is super helpful for following along

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.301
with the podcast and means that you can understand every word and

00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:43.471
build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.471
So that's definitely worth checking out if you haven't done so already.

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:52.014
The link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:56.824
Okay then let's talk about Fox News.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.157
For those of you that don't know much about

00:02:01.157 --> 00:02:05.297
it, Fox News is an American conservative news channel.

00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:10.757
It's actually America's most watched network on basic cable with

00:02:10.757 --> 00:02:14.807
an average of 3.5 million prime time viewers.

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:19.897
And it has been getting more and more popular over the past few years.

00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:22.144
Why is this?

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:27.524
Well, there are a few theories, but the obvious one might be that

00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:32.774
Fox News has a very, very cosy relationship with President Trump.

00:02:33.994 --> 00:02:39.124
From an early stage in the Trump presidency, and even beforehand, during his

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:46.829
candidacy, Fox News decided it was going to be almost unwaveringly loyal to the president.

00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:52.712
And its loyalty has been repaid by Trump frequently re-tweeting

00:02:52.712 --> 00:02:58.712
clips, telling people to watch Fox News and appearing on the new shows.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.590
And no matter what you might think

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.580
of Donald Trump, he certainly does bring in viewers.

00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:11.875
For those of you who are unfamiliar with Fox News and

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:17.935
haven't ever watched any of the clips of Fox News, you might think, hang

00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:23.905
on, if it's just the news, why is one particular channel so popular?

00:03:24.905 --> 00:03:28.625
Isn't the news or pretty much the same nowadays?

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:31.535
Don't they just report what has happened?

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:37.305
Well, despite being called Fox News, the majority of the

00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:43.095
content that is actually on Fox News is more opinion than news.

00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:51.621
The typical format is one of their star hosts, their star presenters will

00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:58.501
talk about something that has happened, but will give a very strong opinion on the event

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:05.241
and on the implications for Fox News viewers, for ordinary Americans, as they would say.

00:04:06.807 --> 00:04:10.625
And when it comes to Trump, which it almost always does

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:15.506
with Fox News, the default position of almost every

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:21.416
anchor, almost every presenter on Fox News, is to staunchly defend him.

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:28.621
So it's not so much news, but rather a constant stream of opinion.

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:36.761
If you switch on Fox News looking for a balanced and objective view of

00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:41.381
the day's events, well, I think you will end up slightly disappointed.

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:50.429
But the thing here is that opinion sells, opinion is what draws in the viewers.

00:04:51.594 --> 00:04:56.436
In the era of information being so easy to distribute,

00:04:56.436 --> 00:05:03.396
the value of actually being on the ground and reporting news has reduced.

00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:13.266
When news can be reported by anyone with a Twitter account, the value of just being there and saying

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:18.820
what happened is much less today then it was even 10 years ago.

00:05:20.408 --> 00:05:22.369
And Fox News knows this.

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:28.054
Out of the top 15 cable shows in America, Fox News has

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:32.034
13 of them, and they all do a pretty similar thing.

00:05:32.544 --> 00:05:37.464
It's a strong conservative opinion that is almost universally

00:05:37.464 --> 00:05:41.664
based on defending or complimenting President Trump.

00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:48.571
And this, for a country with a theoretically free media that

00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:54.181
talks so strongly about the power of free speech, this can seem just mad.

00:05:55.418 --> 00:06:01.478
Lou Dobbs, who is a Fox News host and an incredibly loyal Trump supporter,

00:06:02.018 --> 00:06:09.063
recently asked his viewers to rate President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:12.443
Viewers were given three options.

00:06:13.403 --> 00:06:17.183
Very good, excellent, and superb.

00:06:18.683 --> 00:06:25.523
Right, that seems to be reaching some North Korean levels of obsession with one's dear leader.

00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:28.595
And despite the rest of the world.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.670
I think we can safely say not putting Trump's performance on coronavirus in any of those three

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:43.620
categories, those three categories do strangely enough, seem appropriate for the Fox audience.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.060
63% of Fox News viewers did rate his performance as excellent.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.400
Well, I guess at least most of them didn't rate it as superb as that

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.245
really would make you think of it being like a Pyongyang type situation.

00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:08.245
So from an outsider's perspective, as a non-American, it's just mad

00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:13.675
to think that this is what millions of people are actually consuming every evening.

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:18.748
While it might be mad on some levels, Fox

00:07:18.748 --> 00:07:22.648
News certainly knows its audience and it knows what they want.

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:30.209
It knows that Trump sells, it knows the buttons to press to ignite its audience,

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:35.692
and it doesn't shy away from controversy, it doesn't avoid controversy.

00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:45.922
And because of its outspoken views on certain topics, Fox News has got into some hot water, it

00:07:45.922 --> 00:07:53.797
has got into quite a lot of trouble with the advertisers that pay to show adverts on its shows.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:59.833
Lots of the bigger shows have lost a load of their advertisers.

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:07.243
There have been big social media campaigns where customers try to get companies to stop advertising

00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:13.363
on Fox News saying that they will boycott, they will stop shopping with them, if they don't.

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:20.335
On one level, these petitions have worked, they have served their purpose.

00:08:21.025 --> 00:08:26.065
Lots of advertisers have indeed pulled their adverts from Fox News.

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:31.782
One show, the Tucker Carlson show, has lost dozens of

00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:36.977
advertisers, and it's estimated that advertising revenue, the money they

00:08:36.977 --> 00:08:41.837
have made from advertising, has fallen by tens of millions of dollars.

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:49.567
Brands just don't want to be featured alongside programmes with views that their

00:08:49.597 --> 00:08:55.357
customers might find offensive, so they've just stopped showing ads on Fox News.

00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:59.701
But, and here is where it gets really interesting,

00:09:00.411 --> 00:09:06.021
even with no advertising money Fox News is still a very profitable

00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:10.545
organisation and it manages to make a vast amount of money.

00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:14.851
How this actually works is fascinating.

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:21.101
So there are TV channels, cable companies, and customers, the viewers.

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:27.251
Customers generally subscribe to a cable company

00:09:27.251 --> 00:09:30.641
which provides them with a series of different TV channels.

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:37.486
The TV channels charge the cable networks a fee for each customer,

00:09:38.026 --> 00:09:42.136
no matter whether that customer ever actually watches the channel.

00:09:43.505 --> 00:09:48.471
And Fox News charges a huge amount to the

00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:52.701
cable companies, which they then pass on to the customers.

00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:59.931
So to give you an example, while a network like MSNBC charges

00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:06.642
about 33 cents for each customer, CNN charges between 70

00:10:06.642 --> 00:10:12.612
and 90 cents per customer, Fox News charges around $2 for each customer.

00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:18.838
It can afford to charge so much, firstly because it brings in

00:10:18.898 --> 00:10:23.578
lots of viewers, the cable companies know that if they don't offer

00:10:23.608 --> 00:10:30.598
Fox News, they will lose subscribers, and $2 to pass onto a customer isn't that

00:10:30.598 --> 00:10:36.808
much when the majority of American cable subscribers are paying over $75 a month.

00:10:38.873 --> 00:10:43.523
These fees that Fox gets from the cable companies and

00:10:43.523 --> 00:10:48.413
ultimately from the customers are worth 1.8 billion a year.

00:10:49.913 --> 00:10:56.663
So just to reiterate on that, even if you don't watch Fox News, if you have a cable

00:10:56.663 --> 00:11:03.113
subscription with Fox News in it, you're still paying about $2 a month for Fox News.

00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:09.396
Secondly, which I think is also pretty interesting, Fox News does

00:11:09.396 --> 00:11:16.326
an excellent job at presenting itself as the voice of the underdog, the voice

00:11:16.326 --> 00:11:23.316
of the true real American, and anyone who tries to silence it is an enemy of the

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:28.266
people, an enemy of free speech, an enemy of American freedoms.

00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:36.171
So why I mentioned this is that Fox News hosts frequently talk about the fact that

00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:41.511
cable companies are looking to remove Fox News from their packages,

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:48.278
and it asks, or rather encourages its viewers to complain, telling

00:11:48.278 --> 00:11:53.558
them that their cable company is trying to silence them, is trying to silence Fox News.

00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:58.541
Understandably, this means that there's pressure from the

00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:03.559
cable companies not to drop Fox News and means that Fox News

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:08.779
can charge larger and larger amounts of money to the cable companies.

00:12:09.283 --> 00:12:11.563
They are basically holding them hostage,

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:14.023
using their viewers as hostages.

00:12:15.253 --> 00:12:21.733
So even without advertisers, Fox News can still survive and even flourish.

00:12:22.393 --> 00:12:27.283
Such is the power of its community, of presenting itself as the

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.620
voice of the underdog, of the underrepresented American.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.910
The thing that I find particularly funny about this, or maybe it's

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:43.190
not even that funny at all, is that Fox News isn't even that American.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:48.680
It was created by an Australian, the media mogul, Rupert Murdoch.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:55.200
Now, the empire of Rupert Murdoch is too wide and far reaching to

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:02.340
explain just as a small section in a podcast, but he is the boss of NewsCorp, a huge

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:07.950
media conglomerate that spans newspapers and TV across the world.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:15.820
And whatever Murdoch's personal opinions may be, he is evidently incredibly

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:21.910
savvy, very smart, and knows what makes people want to read or watch something.

00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:29.739
And from early on it was clear that he had an idea about what people wanted.

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:38.842
Here's a quote from him in 1996 when Fox News launched, he said, "the appetite

00:13:38.842 --> 00:13:46.642
for news, particularly news that explains to people how it affects them is expanding enormously".

00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:52.530
Whether news that explains to people how it affects them is still

00:13:52.530 --> 00:14:00.270
true is slightly dubious, but 25 years ago, Murdoch saw that people wanted opinion.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.670
Opinion is what sells, opinion is what brings people together.

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:12.975
And if you can make people think that their views are being aired, that they are being supported,

00:14:13.455 --> 00:14:19.065
then they will feel more and more loyal to the network that they feel is supporting them.

00:14:21.435 --> 00:14:24.675
So who are these people that are watching Fox News?

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:28.545
Who are these 3.5 million people who are watching it every day?

00:14:29.115 --> 00:14:33.045
Well, I guess this might not come as a huge surprise to you.

00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:39.645
Firstly, it's mainly conservatives, the programming is all pretty conservative.

00:14:40.035 --> 00:14:46.095
And while Democrats tend to be split between a few different channels,

00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:51.465
there isn't really anything in America that unites conservatives

00:14:51.675 --> 00:14:56.085
and those on the right, in terms of news channels, like Fox News.

00:14:57.795 --> 00:15:00.585
The viewers are also in general, older.

00:15:01.185 --> 00:15:06.045
The median age is 68, and nine out of 10 are white.

00:15:07.885 --> 00:15:12.685
So you can, I guess, see why the Trump message resonates with

00:15:12.685 --> 00:15:18.025
this group of predominantly older, conservative, white Americans.

00:15:19.013 --> 00:15:23.566
It's about making America great again, going back to some idyllic

00:15:23.566 --> 00:15:30.921
time that people like Fox News viewers imagine as preferable to a modern globalised world.

00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:36.071
There is one interesting development though, relating to the Fox News

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:43.421
audience that could end up being the undoing of Fox News, the downfall of the channel.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:50.709
At the start of the Coronavirus outbreak, Fox News downplayed the impact

00:15:50.709 --> 00:15:57.879
of the virus, with one host even calling it another attempt to impeach the president.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:05.709
Despite the fact that Fox News has now completely reversed its position, has changed

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:11.649
its opinion, even saying that it always said that the Coronavirus was an important thing to take

00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:17.844
seriously, there are countless times in its programmes where it certainly minimised the threat.

00:16:19.724 --> 00:16:26.174
And of course its viewers are loyal and likely to believe what their favourite hosts tell them.

00:16:27.624 --> 00:16:31.734
Now, the current view is that the older you are, the more liable

00:16:31.734 --> 00:16:35.934
you are to have health problems and even die from the coronavirus.

00:16:36.534 --> 00:16:42.099
And the Fox News viewers who had been told that the coronavirus wasn't

00:16:42.099 --> 00:16:47.139
anything to worry about, well, they are considerably older than the average.

00:16:48.489 --> 00:16:54.609
So there is a big fear at the moment that there will be some kind of huge lawsuit

00:16:54.879 --> 00:17:00.729
from the families of Fox News viewers who died from the coronavirus saying that

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:05.589
the network minimised the risk, and so their viewers didn't take it seriously.

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:12.156
Fox News is at the moment, very busy preparing itself for

00:17:12.156 --> 00:17:16.758
this as it could end up being an incredibly expensive case.

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:22.966
Who knows what will happen, but it would be slightly ironic if

00:17:22.996 --> 00:17:27.856
something that the hosts had spent weeks calling a hoax and nothing to worry

00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:33.586
about was the thing that finally did for this network that has made billions

00:17:33.586 --> 00:17:39.466
of dollars through having a pretty fast and loose relationship with the truth.

00:17:41.716 --> 00:17:46.396
Okay then that is it for today's episode on Fox News.

00:17:47.026 --> 00:17:50.956
As I said, I'm not an American, as you can tell from my accent, but

00:17:51.016 --> 00:17:56.356
it is pretty fascinating for an outsider to think that this network really is so

00:17:56.356 --> 00:18:02.686
popular with so many Americans, and that shows that you and I might watch clips of

00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:08.776
and almost laugh at, are actually, some of the most popular news shows in America.

00:18:10.036 --> 00:18:12.316
Fascinating, but also pretty scary.

00:18:14.109 --> 00:18:17.259
So for our listeners who do live in America,

00:18:17.259 --> 00:18:21.099
as there are actually quite a few of you, I'd love to hear from you.

00:18:21.609 --> 00:18:23.619
What do you think about Fox News?

00:18:23.859 --> 00:18:27.159

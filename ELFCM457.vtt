Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.149
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:19.019
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.489
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.239
about Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy magazine.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:31.409
To some, he was a visionary leader of the sexual revolution, to others

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.389
he was a creepy misogynist who made millions by exploiting women.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:40.139
He is nothing if not controversial, so let’s not waste a

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.009
minute and find out about the life and times of Hugh Hefner.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.909
In life, we all have experiences that change us.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.169
Something happens to us, we experience something unexpected,

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:57.369
and it causes us to reassess our priorities and life choices.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.599
Perhaps you are thinking of something right now in your life.

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:06.769
Perhaps there has never been anything that has caused a huge, seismic change.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.339
Or perhaps there has been.

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:16.249
Perhaps you have completely done a u-turn, and you were going down one path, and then something

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:21.409
happened, so you are now doing something that you and your family never thought you would do.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.319
Hugh Hefner was in that second category.

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:32.639
He was born in 1926, to a very traditional conservative family in the American midwest.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.939
His parents were devout methodists, and home life was strict.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:45.639
As a young man growing up in the 1930s, he found this a little stifling, a little difficult to deal

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:51.759
with, but there was not much of an alternative - this was early 20th century America, after all.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.929
He did the traditional thing: enlisted in the army, went to college, and proposed

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.494
to his college sweetheart, with the hope to get married as soon as they graduated.

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:09.409
His girlfriend, now fiancée I should say, accepted, and it looked like Hugh Hefner

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.289
would lead a similar life to the millions of other American men of his generation:

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.609
a family, a house in the suburbs, a car, kids, movies on the weekends, and so on.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.539
But, between the time that he proposed in December and the time that they got married the following

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.449
June, Hefner’s fiancée told him that she had been having an affair, she had been cheating on him.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.559
In his own words, it devastated him, he was crushed.

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.309
But, he was a traditional guy, at least at that point.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.859
The marriage went ahead, and the pair went on to have two kids.

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:55.732
He got a job in publishing, at Esquire magazine, and by all accounts was doing well in his career.

00:02:57.192 --> 00:03:00.342
But after his wife had told him that she had been unfaithful,

00:03:00.802 --> 00:03:04.382
something had changed, something had stirred in Hugh Hefner.

00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:11.932
He was unhappy: unhappy at home, unhappy in his job, yearning for something different.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:18.152
In a candid interview when he was in his 80s, he recounted one time when he stood

00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:23.872
on the side of a bridge and just cried, thinking “is this all there is to life?”

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:30.322
And while some people might just suck it up and deal with it, this was

00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:35.302
one of those moments in Hugh Hefner’s life when he did a complete u-turn.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:41.642
He quit his job and decided to start his own what he called “men’s magazine”.

00:03:42.372 --> 00:03:45.512
It would be a new kind of magazine for men, not talking

00:03:45.512 --> 00:03:50.882
about adventure and sports, but music, film and women.

00:03:52.122 --> 00:03:55.792
He didn’t have money of his own, and when he went to ask his father

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:59.052
for a loan to get the business off the ground, he was turned down.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:05.092
After all, his father was a devout Methodist, he thought it was

00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:09.412
immoral and what’s more, he thought it made bad business sense.

00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:15.253
Surprisingly enough, Hefner would have more luck with his mother, who took her

00:04:15.293 --> 00:04:19.233
son to one side one evening and revealed that she had some savings of her own.

00:04:20.183 --> 00:04:25.683
She gave him a $1,000 loan, which would be about $11,000 in today’s money.

00:04:27.203 --> 00:04:31.473
Hefner took the money, along with another $7,000 that he had managed

00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:35.873
to cobble together, and launched what would become Playboy Magazine.

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:42.673
Now, when you think of the words “Playboy Magazine” now, I imagine certain things

00:04:42.673 --> 00:04:47.703
come to mind, most probably women with blonde hair not wearing many clothes.

00:04:49.223 --> 00:04:55.403
When the first Playboy Magazine was launched, in December of 1953, it wasn’t all too different.

00:04:56.773 --> 00:05:02.083
And it launched with a splash, with perhaps the most famous blonde woman

00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:06.513
in the United States, even the world, at that time: Marilyn Monroe.

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:11.443
On the front cover of the first ever Playboy magazine was a picture of

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:15.943
a young Marilyn Monroe, with the headline on the front cover promising

00:05:15.943 --> 00:05:21.633
to reveal the first ever full nude photo in colour of Marilyn Monroe.

00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:28.453
Now, you might be thinking, why on Earth did Marilyn Monroe agree to pose naked for

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:33.793
a then unknown men’s magazine, or perhaps why did she agree to pose naked at all?

00:05:35.283 --> 00:05:37.783
The short answer is…she didn’t.

00:05:38.913 --> 00:05:42.983
These photos were taken of Marilyn Monroe several years beforehand,

00:05:43.173 --> 00:05:47.143
when she had posed naked for a photographer for a measly $50.

00:05:48.453 --> 00:05:53.673
This was in 1949, and Marilyn Monroe was far from a star.

00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:59.583
She needed to make a payment on her car, and this seemed like an easy way to do it.

00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:06.283
Clearly, it was a last resort for the then 23 year old Monroe, as she

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:10.333
had asked the photographer to make her look unrecognisable in the photos.

00:06:11.783 --> 00:06:15.343
Shortly after this photoshoot, her career had started to

00:06:15.343 --> 00:06:18.843
take off, and the photos became increasingly valuable.

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:25.683
Hefner had developed something of a fixation for Marilyn Monroe, and he managed

00:06:25.683 --> 00:06:30.233
to buy the photo rights from another man, not from the movie star herself.

00:06:31.793 --> 00:06:38.553
And so it was that in December 1953, Marilyn Monroe, America’s biggest star,

00:06:39.053 --> 00:06:44.523
found that her nude photos were available for all to see, that was, if they

00:06:44.523 --> 00:06:48.693
were prepared to pay the 50 cents price for a copy of Playboy Magazine.

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:57.443
Perhaps unsurprisingly, 50,000 people were, and the magazine was a hit from its very first edition.

00:06:58.703 --> 00:07:02.313
By its fifth anniversary it was selling over a million copies a

00:07:02.313 --> 00:07:08.663
month, and by 1971 this had increased to 7 million copies every month.

00:07:09.983 --> 00:07:14.843
Now, on one level, you might be thinking “of course it was a successful magazine,

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:19.463
Hefner paid women to take off their clothes and men are filthy animals and

00:07:19.463 --> 00:07:22.813
will obviously pay money to see pictures of women not wearing any clothes”.

00:07:24.203 --> 00:07:31.043
Hugh Hefner, for better or for worse, rightly or wrongly, saw himself as doing something different.

00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:37.673
He saw himself not as a mere salesman of vice, but as someone who was

00:07:37.713 --> 00:07:42.083
pushing the boundaries of acceptability, as someone who challenged the

00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:47.413
status quo and was on the forefront of the American sexual revolution.

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:53.183
Now, as a reminder, the magazine was launched in the early 1950s.

00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:58.248
Any kind of sexual relations outside of a marriage between a man and a woman

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:03.508
were somewhat frowned upon, and certainly not talked about in magazines.

00:08:05.128 --> 00:08:07.568
Playboy was the antithesis of this.

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.918
But it wasn’t just nude pictures of women.

00:08:11.628 --> 00:08:16.398
It was also a serious magazine, or at least had columns written by people

00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:21.626
we now regard as serious journalists and authors: people like John le Carré,

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:27.218
Kurt Vonnegut, Gabriel García Márquez, Vladimir Nabokov, and even Roald Dahl.

00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:32.668
There were interviews with figures such as Martin Luther King Junior, Malcolm X,

00:08:32.968 --> 00:08:38.878
Salvador Dalí and Jean-Paul Sartre, later on even the former president Jimmy Carter.

00:08:40.098 --> 00:08:45.078
I mean, if you read a list of the people who have either been interviewed by or

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:49.738
written for Playboy Magazine and you were asked to guess the magazine they’ve

00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:54.448
all been in, I imagine that Playboy wouldn’t be the first name that came to mind.

00:08:55.788 --> 00:09:02.018
For all of the pictures of scantily-clad women, it was also a magazine with some serious writing.

00:09:03.508 --> 00:09:06.608
And at the centre of it all was Hugh Hefner.

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:13.488
He wasn’t just the owner of the magazine or the editor, he was the embodiment of the Playboy ethos.

00:09:14.558 --> 00:09:20.348
He had divorced his wife in 1959, after having had two children, and was keen to

00:09:20.348 --> 00:09:26.328
portray himself as the living manifestation of his creation: the ultimate playboy.

00:09:27.508 --> 00:09:32.628
He launched a TV show where he would record his parties at his penthouse, which would be full of

00:09:32.628 --> 00:09:39.908
alcohol, raunchy music, beautiful women, and controversially at the time, people of all races.

00:09:41.068 --> 00:09:44.938
For all of his many faults, which we will talk about more in a few

00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:49.448
moments, Hefner showed a remarkable tolerance in certain areas.

00:09:50.228 --> 00:09:51.538
Race was one of them.

00:09:52.778 --> 00:09:57.258
In an era when there was still racial segregation laws in the south of the United

00:09:57.348 --> 00:10:03.008
States, Hugh Hefner featured black artists and writers when other magazines wouldn’t.

00:10:04.258 --> 00:10:06.088
Similarly, with gay rights.

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:11.978
In 1955, two years after the launch of Playboy, he made the decision to publish

00:10:11.998 --> 00:10:16.768
a short story called “The Crooked Man”, by an author called Charles Beaumont.

00:10:17.858 --> 00:10:23.068
Beaumont had offered the story to Hefner’s previous employer, to Esquire

00:10:23.068 --> 00:10:27.588
magazine, but it had been rejected on the grounds that it was inappropriate.

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:32.768
The story, see, was about a future in which homosexuality

00:10:32.898 --> 00:10:36.618
was the norm and heterosexual men were persecuted.

00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:40.688
I read it, and it’s actually quite a good story, if you’re interested.

00:10:42.088 --> 00:10:45.198
The point is, it was highly controversial at the time,

00:10:45.588 --> 00:10:49.828
and the Playboy offices were inundated by angry letters.

00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:57.758
Hefner defended his decision to publish the story, and the message of the story, saying "If it

00:10:57.758 --> 00:11:03.528
was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society then the reverse was wrong, too."

00:11:04.918 --> 00:11:11.148
Of course, this was the point the story was trying to make, but it took some bravery for someone

00:11:11.158 --> 00:11:18.418
to say it in 1955, when homosexual sex was still a criminal activity in much of the United States.

00:11:19.508 --> 00:11:26.688
So, in some respects, Hefner clearly had some progressive, admirable views we might even say.

00:11:28.138 --> 00:11:33.528
But when it came to his views towards women, the situation is more complicated.

00:11:34.198 --> 00:11:39.078
Or perhaps it’s less complicated, depending on your opinion of Hefner and Playboy magazine.

00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:44.888
According to Hefner, he was an advocate for women to take control of their

00:11:44.888 --> 00:11:50.348
sexuality, to embrace their femininity and innately human attraction.

00:11:51.478 --> 00:11:55.568
Women were under no obligation to pose for his magazines, he

00:11:55.568 --> 00:11:59.548
said, no one was forcing anybody to do anything they didn’t want.

00:12:00.858 --> 00:12:05.318
What’s more, 1 in 4 readers of Playboy Magazine were women.

00:12:06.668 --> 00:12:11.468
But according to his critics, he was a vile misogynist.

00:12:11.828 --> 00:12:16.688
He objectified women in his magazines, and in his private life, which was not really at all

00:12:16.698 --> 00:12:23.758
separate from his public life, he treated women merely as objects to satisfy his own sexual desire.

00:12:24.448 --> 00:12:29.098
Now, in case you didn't know much about Hugh Hefner before this, in his latter years,

00:12:29.378 --> 00:12:34.548
so let’s say from the 1990s onwards, he would be pictured with an array of different

00:12:34.558 --> 00:12:40.668
girlfriends, all significantly younger than him, and almost all of them being Playboy models.

00:12:41.858 --> 00:12:47.558
He was there, in his 60s, 70s and then 80s, with his arm around a woman in her

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:52.748
early 20s, and he would boast that this was just one of his many girlfriends.

00:12:53.808 --> 00:12:59.388
At one point he claimed that he had 7 girlfriends at the same time, which he then trimmed

00:12:59.398 --> 00:13:07.418
down to four, before marrying a third time in 2012, when he was 86 and his wife was 26.

00:13:08.668 --> 00:13:13.808
Naturally, his bride was a Playboy model, and looked eerily similar

00:13:13.998 --> 00:13:17.248
to most of the other women who had graced the pages of the magazine.

00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:24.548
He died in September 2017, at the age of 91, leaving his 31-year old widow.

00:13:25.748 --> 00:13:31.888
And after his death, all sorts of nasty stories started to come out from under the woodwork.

00:13:33.058 --> 00:13:37.918
Former girlfriends spoke about how he had encouraged them to use drugs before having sex

00:13:37.918 --> 00:13:43.708
with him, how he would give each girlfriend $1,000 every week as pocket money, how there

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:48.858
were strict curfews at the Playboy mansions where he lived with his girlfriends, how he

00:13:48.858 --> 00:13:53.348
had incredibly strict standards of physical appearance that he expected his girlfriends

00:13:53.348 --> 00:13:59.558
to uphold, how he encouraged infighting and rivalry between his girlfriends, and how to

00:13:59.558 --> 00:14:05.038
some it had felt like an almost prison-like atmosphere from which there was no escape.

00:14:06.268 --> 00:14:13.218
This was obviously unpleasant stuff, but it came as a surprise to few, especially to his critics.

00:14:14.048 --> 00:14:19.378
After all, he had built his career on the nude bodies of women, he had positioned himself

00:14:19.538 --> 00:14:24.515
as a philanderer and a sort of Cassanova-type figure, I don’t think many people were

00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:29.885
surprised to hear that in the privacy of his own home, surrounded by hordes of women

00:14:30.175 --> 00:14:35.825
60 years his junior, he viewed himself in this way, and had behaved in such a manner.

00:14:37.155 --> 00:14:41.905
Since his death, a bunch of different girlfriends and indeed his widow, his

00:14:42.045 --> 00:14:46.715
wife when he died, have announced book deals and TV series where they have

00:14:46.905 --> 00:14:51.145
“revealed all” about what happened behind closed doors at the Playboy Mansions,

00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:56.195
and told all sorts of deep dark secrets about the man at the centre of it all.

00:14:57.095 --> 00:15:03.156
It all sounds pretty vile, and was a dark stain on the personal legacy of Hugh Hefner.

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:11.096
And in terms of the wider impact of the man and his magazine, well, he fought conservative critics

00:15:11.146 --> 00:15:19.076
during his lifetime, and after his death in 2017 his legacy has come under even greater scrutiny.

00:15:20.616 --> 00:15:25.926
He once boasted that he was “a feminist”, arguing that he was allowing women

00:15:25.926 --> 00:15:31.166
to embrace their sexuality, and that sex was simply a natural part of life.

00:15:32.596 --> 00:15:38.626
But to others, especially in the wake of the #MeToo movement, he was a misogynist, a

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:44.246
man who built an empire on the commodification of women’s bodies, someone who persuaded

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:50.646
hundreds of women that posing naked for the enjoyment of men was in some way “empowering”.

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:56.036
He is now buried in a cemetery in Hollywood, in the crypt

00:15:56.226 --> 00:15:59.776
right next to Marilyn Monroe, as per his dying wish.

00:16:01.296 --> 00:16:06.446
Despite the fact that it was Marilyn Monroe who launched Hefner’s career, when

00:16:06.656 --> 00:16:11.616
Hefner used her nude photo without her permission, the pair were not friends.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.826
They never actually even met.

00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:19.298
He had bought the burial spot right next to Marilyn Monroe in 1992.

00:16:20.596 --> 00:16:24.336
When he was asked why, he responded with, "Spending eternity

00:16:24.336 --> 00:16:28.006
next to Marilyn is an opportunity too sweet to pass up".

00:16:29.276 --> 00:16:34.196
One imagines that Marilyn Monroe might not feel exactly the same way…

00:16:36.086 --> 00:16:39.566
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Hugh

00:16:39.566 --> 00:16:42.936
Hefner, the controversial founder of Playboy magazine.

00:16:43.656 --> 00:16:49.066
We are actually going to be following up this episode with another one on the theme of 18+ rated

00:16:49.066 --> 00:16:54.646
content, and that will be on a website that launched a year after Hefner’s death: Onlyfans.

00:16:55.136 --> 00:16:57.856
So, keep a lookout for that one coming up this week.

00:16:58.756 --> 00:17:01.336
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:01.706 --> 00:17:04.066
What do you think about the legacy of Hugh Hefner?

00:17:04.436 --> 00:17:07.236
Is he nothing more than a dirty old man who exploited

00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:11.016
women, or do you think his legacy is more nuanced than that?

00:17:11.626 --> 00:17:15.916
The place for that is our community forum, which is at community.leonardoenglish.com.

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning For Curious Minds podcast

00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:08.837
by Leonardo English.

00:00:09.317 --> 00:00:14.957
I'm your host Alastair Budge, and it's time for the final part, part three of our three-part mini

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:18.587
series on who owns the sea, sky and space.

00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:24.947
And this means today we are talking about space, who owns it and why that matters.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:30.632
If you haven't already checked out parts one and two, which are who owns the sea and who owns the

00:00:30.632 --> 00:00:34.142
sky, then I'd really recommend listening to them first.

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:39.212
You can certainly listen to this podcast without having listened to the others, but you'll get a lot

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:44.372
more value if you've listened to the first two as they will help explain some of the things we'll be

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:45.452
talking about today,

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:51.842
And this is your customary reminder that you can grab a copy of the key vocabulary and transcripts

00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:55.827
for this podcast on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:56.927 --> 00:00:58.787
Okay then, let's get cracking.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:02.597
Space, the final frontier, the cosmos,

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:09.707
The moon, sun and stars have of course, captivated the minds of philosophers, scientists, and just

00:01:09.707 --> 00:01:17.045
about everyone since the beginning of time, but they were always so far away, so unreachable that

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:20.015
there was no need to think about ownership.

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:28.535
Of course, a large proportion of major religions and belief systems held the stars and space as the

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:31.835
realm of the gods, the afterlife, and so on.

00:01:32.135 --> 00:01:34.085
They belonged to the gods.

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:39.807
And even for those who might not believe in any kind of supernatural properties of the stars or

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:46.617
space, it seemed implausible, so unbelievable, impossible that anyone could actually get there.

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:51.897
So what was the point of deciding who would own it if they could?

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:58.100
Then in the latter half of the 20th century, everything changed.

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:05.614
Starting with Sputnik One, the first satellite to be sent into space in 1957, mankind had finally

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:07.474
sent something into orbit.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.976
And just four years later, in 1961 Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin became the first human to ever make it

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:16.726
into space.

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:24.046
It suddenly became clear that space wasn't beyond the realms of possibility, and there was a real

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:30.346
sense in the 1950s and 60s that space was going to be where the Cold War was fought.

00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:36.871
You only have to read some science fiction from the fifties and sixties to understand quite how real

00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:43.741
the belief was that space was the next logical frontier for the battle between East and West.

00:02:44.614 --> 00:02:50.901
Given that space was no longer beyond the reach of man, there needed to be agreement about who owned

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:53.361
it or rather who didn't own it.

00:02:54.561 --> 00:03:02.151
The rest of the earth, sea and sky was divided up, but space, well, that didn't really belong to

00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:02.601
anyone.

00:03:03.684 --> 00:03:11.648
Neil Armstrong famously placed an American flag on the moon in 1969 which may have implied some sort

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:13.958
of ownership, but this was just figurative.

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:16.268
It didn't actually mean anything.

00:03:16.568 --> 00:03:22.748
The fact that the Americans were the first people to set foot on the moon didn't mean that they

00:03:22.748 --> 00:03:25.328
owned the moon any more than you or I do.

00:03:26.348 --> 00:03:26.918
Why not?

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:28.178
I guess you might wondering.

00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:34.148
Well, in 1967 a treaty was formed documenting the laws of space.

00:03:35.228 --> 00:03:42.098
It is now called the Outer Space Treaty, but previously it went by the slightly less catchy Treaty

00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:47.258
On Principles Governing The Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space,

00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:49.298
Including The Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:53.078
So it seems like a sensible name change to have made.

00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:59.588
For those of you who remember part one of this series, you may recall the United Nations Convention

00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:03.908
on the Laws of the Sea, which was actually signed a little later, in 1982.

00:04:04.362 --> 00:04:08.613
The Outer Space Treaty is a similar kind of concept, but for space.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:14.272
From the point of view of ownership, it's actually far simpler than the Convention on the Law of the

00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:21.352
Sea because well, it states that no country can claim ownership over any part of space, that nobody

00:04:21.352 --> 00:04:21.802
owns it.

00:04:22.522 --> 00:04:28.642
It states that space exploration shall be free for all countries for the benefit of mankind.

00:04:29.782 --> 00:04:35.992
As a side note, the main purpose of the Outer Space Treaty wasn't actually to define ownership, it

00:04:35.992 --> 00:04:40.582
was to ban the use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction in space.

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:46.354
Remember, there was this very strong belief during the Cold War that there was this real

00:04:46.354 --> 00:04:52.654
possibility, and certainly in the West at least, that the Soviet Union could send nuclear bombs into

00:04:52.654 --> 00:04:57.184
space and then fire them back down on the US and of course vice-versa.

00:04:57.334 --> 00:05:00.394
The USSR believed that the US would do the same to them.

00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:04.889
So in terms of ownership of space, where does that leave us?

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.819
If nobody owns it, what does that actually mean from a practical point of view?

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:17.315
Are countries free to go to the moon, Mars and beyond, and not to have to worry about anything, as

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:18.775
it doesn't belong to anything?

00:05:19.525 --> 00:05:26.515
In a world, or should I say in a, in a universe where humans colonise Mars, who actually owns the

00:05:26.515 --> 00:05:28.135
land, what laws apply?

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.813
At the moment, some of these definitions are a little loose.

00:05:33.117 --> 00:05:39.837
For starters, the definition of space isn't clear, as we talked about in part two and there's

00:05:39.837 --> 00:05:43.707
currently a working group at the UN trying to tidy this up.

00:05:44.187 --> 00:05:49.817
It looks like the demarcation of space will be at the Karmen line, as listeners from part two of

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:54.399
this series will remember as the line a hundred kilometres up from the Earth's surface.

00:05:54.863 --> 00:05:59.363
At least the definition of where space ends on the other side is clear.

00:05:59.783 --> 00:06:01.913
On one level at least it never ends, right?

00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:04.763
It's everything beyond where it starts and it is expanding.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:12.357
And in terms of how countries or companies should interact within space, there also isn't a huge

00:06:12.357 --> 00:06:13.917
amount of clarity provided here.

00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:20.727
As the treaty was principally around ensuring that space remained a peaceful place, free of nuclear

00:06:20.727 --> 00:06:26.667
weapons, there isn't much provision made for commercial activity in space, be that space tourism or

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:29.307
the use of space for natural resource extraction.

00:06:29.736 --> 00:06:37.259
So the law is unclear on whether a private company can go to the moon, Mars, or beyond, mine natural

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.909
resources and bring them back to the Earth for profit.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:46.529
Of course, on the Earth's surface, if a company did this, then they would have to pay some sort of

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.779
fee to the country that owned the territory.

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.339
But in space, if nobody owns it, well who would they pay?

00:06:53.863 --> 00:06:55.483
This is the unclear part.

00:06:56.113 --> 00:07:01.603
There is a proliferation of companies that are trying to develop technology for a future where there

00:07:01.603 --> 00:07:08.653
is some level of colonisation of space, from Elon Musk to companies like Moon Express and Planetary

00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:12.763
Resources, but no clear legal framework for how they should all work.

00:07:13.603 --> 00:07:14.773
Why is this important?

00:07:15.343 --> 00:07:21.043
Well, the space industry is set to grow to $1 trillion by the year 2040.

00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:27.921
You don't have to hear it from me that the Earth is over-populated, with the global population

00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:35.505
predicted to hit 10 billion shortly after 2050 and of course, natural resources are finite and space

00:07:35.505 --> 00:07:39.645
entrepreneurs believe space to be an untapped source of resources.

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:44.016
Just Google Elon Musk colonise Mars if you want to learn more about this.

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:51.825
Another aspect of space ownership that isn't particularly clear is that although space itself isn't

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:59.175
owned by anyone, anything that goes into space is technically sovereign territory of the state from

00:07:59.175 --> 00:08:00.045
where it was launched.

00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:05.145
So a Russian spacecraft is technically in Russian territory when it's in space.

00:08:05.955 --> 00:08:11.625
Similar to the Convention on the Law of the Sea, ships have to obey the laws of the country where

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:12.255
they're registered.

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:14.325
This is a similar idea, but for space.

00:08:15.165 --> 00:08:22.153
This of course becomes all the more complicated in the event that the space shuttle, for example, is

00:08:22.153 --> 00:08:24.313
damaged and splits into lots of different pieces.

00:08:24.883 --> 00:08:30.973
If, for example, a Chinese launched satellite is damaged and splits into a thousand different

00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:36.043
pieces, a million different pieces, this could be interpreted to mean that there are a thousand, a

00:08:36.043 --> 00:08:39.493
million little pieces of Chinese territory orbiting the earth.

00:08:41.016 --> 00:08:46.738
Where almost everyone is in agreement is that ownership of outer space needs a lot more

00:08:46.738 --> 00:08:53.846
clarification and current global laws are not set up for a world of space mining, space travel and

00:08:54.073 --> 00:08:59.377
and large scale colonisation of other planets I don't think we're in any danger of that happening in

00:08:59.377 --> 00:09:05.032
the immediate future, although I guess people back in the 13th century looked up to the sky and

00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:09.292
said, we don't really need to worry about figuring out who owns that, there's no one will ever get

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:09.502
there.

00:09:09.922 --> 00:09:11.294
And then evidently they did.

00:09:12.308 --> 00:09:18.074
In terms of space entrepreneurs though, and ownership of space, it's not all scientists building

00:09:18.074 --> 00:09:19.374
rockets and space shuttles.

00:09:20.114 --> 00:09:25.994
Indeed, the lack of clarity on ownership of space hasn't stopped one American based entrepreneur

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:27.944
trying to sell the moon and Mars.

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:34.859
Dennis Hope of Nevada has been selling land on the moon and Mars since 1980.

00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:41.279
In fact, for less than $20 you can grab yourself an acre of the moon, perhaps a nice Christmas

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:41.489
present.

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:48.344
I should point out though, that the probability of this holding up in court is comparable to your

00:09:48.344 --> 00:09:53.774
probability of actually being able to get there, and so I'd hesitate before deciding to plough your

00:09:53.774 --> 00:09:57.554
life savings into becoming a lunar real estate tycoon.

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:02.473
Okay then, today we have covered who owned space.

00:10:02.893 --> 00:10:08.743
On one level, the answer is simple, nobody, and yet everybody.

00:10:09.733 --> 00:10:17.458
In 2019 this may not be a huge issue, but in a world or should I say universe where space becomes

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:23.308
more congested than it is today, then ownership is going to be a bit of a thorny issue and there

00:10:23.308 --> 00:10:29.428
certainly needs to be a lot more work done on clarification of how it actually works.

00:10:30.628 --> 00:10:36.328
I hope that you've enjoyed this podcast and this mini-series on who owns the sea, sky, and space.

00:10:36.738 --> 00:10:41.328
If you haven't listened to the first two parts yet, then they are well worth a listen, if I may say

00:10:41.328 --> 00:10:42.048
so myself.

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:45.408
Ownership of stuff is, well, it's complicated.

00:10:45.798 --> 00:10:50.508
It's not something that you think about every day, but I find this kind of stuff absolutely

00:10:50.508 --> 00:10:51.138
fascinating.

00:10:52.128 --> 00:10:54.498
Stay tuned for more mini-series like this.

00:10:54.498 --> 00:10:59.528
It's been a fun one to make and I hope that you've learned a lot about who owns what.

00:11:00.503 --> 00:11:03.563
As always, thank you very much for listening to the show.

00:11:03.923 --> 00:11:08.843
If you've enjoyed it, then do consider taking 20 seconds out of your day and leaving a review.

00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:15.743
Every review puts a smile on my face and tells people what the podcast is about, so those are two

00:11:15.743 --> 00:11:16.613
pretty good things.

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:22.433

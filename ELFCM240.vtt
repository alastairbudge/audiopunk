Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:17.867
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:22.167
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:30.047
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Rise And Fall of Boris Johnson.

00:00:30.717 --> 00:00:36.097
He is, as of the time this episode was recorded, the British Prime Minister.

00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:41.157
But, depending on when you listen to this episode, the correct verb

00:00:41.177 --> 00:00:45.177
tense to use will probably be “was the British Prime Minister”.

00:00:45.717 --> 00:00:51.597
His rise to power was long, indirect, and perhaps, unlikely.

00:00:52.012 --> 00:00:58.637
And his fall, even if he might not have completely fallen yet, was entirely predictable.

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:05.197
So, in this episode we’ll start by talking about Boris Johnson the man, his

00:01:05.487 --> 00:01:10.617
early life, how this shaped his personality, and how he rose to be the most

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:15.437
powerful politician in the country with the fifth largest economy in the world.

00:01:15.997 --> 00:01:20.617
On our journey, in his story, we will deal with affairs,

00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:24.627
privilege, comedy, ambition and broken promises.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.509
OK then, The Rise And Fall of Boris Johnson.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.289
Boris Johnson is often likened to Donald Trump.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.699
Both men came to political power on a nationalistic and anti-establishment message.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.103
They were both populists.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.449
They were both men with privileged upbringings, they had wealthy parents.

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:56.329
They both seemed to get in trouble for saying things they shouldn’t,

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:01.469
and no matter how many inappropriate things they said, or did,

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.319
no matter how much trouble they got into, they remained popular.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.109
There are plenty more comparisons - they have both been married

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:16.571
multiple times, they both have similar blonde hair, although Boris

00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:21.231
appears to pay significantly less attention to his than Trump does.

00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:25.971
But really, to say that Boris Johnson is a British

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:29.891
Donald Trump is a gross simplification of the truth.

00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:36.691
Although those comparisons are fair, Boris Johnson is a uniquely

00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:42.451
British, really actually a uniquely English phenomenon, and his life

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:47.301
probably has more differences than similarities to that of Donald Trump.

00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:53.031
From an early age, he always sensed he was destined for

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:57.911
greatness, and told his mother he wanted to be a “world king”.

00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:05.321
He was a talented schoolboy, and won a scholarship to the most prestigious private

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:11.371
school in the country, Eton, a school that has produced twenty prime ministers.

00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:16.871
But he was, by all reports, a lazy student.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:21.753
He knew that he was clever, he knew he could make his classmates

00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:26.765
and teachers laugh and he knew he didn’t have to work very hard.

00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:33.377
A report from his teacher at school read that Johnson thought he should be viewed

00:03:33.557 --> 00:03:39.587
as different, and not have the same obligations as other boys at the school.

00:03:40.827 --> 00:03:47.037
This is an important early sign, and is a characteristic that we’ll see throughout

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:52.647
his life and career - that of believing that different rules apply to him.

00:03:53.937 --> 00:03:57.547
He won a place at Oxford University, but his

00:03:57.897 --> 00:04:02.757
laissez-faire attitude to work, his laziness, continued.

00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:09.617
Now, this is by no means to suggest that every 19-year-old at university should

00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:16.257
be spending 12 hours a day at the library and having no fun, but Johnson was known

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:23.247
more for his partying and damaging fancy restaurants than for attending lectures.

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:32.067
After his graduation, he was briefly hired as a management consultant, a business consultant

00:04:32.147 --> 00:04:39.127
essentially, but he found the world of business, the corporate world incredibly dull.

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:45.207
He later said "Try as I might, I could not look at an overhead

00:04:45.207 --> 00:04:49.526
projection of a growth-profit matrix and stay conscious".

00:04:50.787 --> 00:04:57.837
He only lasted one week in the job before quitting, and being hired as a journalist.

00:04:58.457 --> 00:05:05.887
He was only 23 so, understandably, he was given relatively uninteresting stories to work on.

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:13.547
Desperate to try to do something more interesting, he completely invented a quote

00:05:13.737 --> 00:05:18.902
for one of his stories, to try to make it more interesting to the reader, and

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:25.812
when his lie was discovered he was promptly sacked from the job, he lost his job.

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:31.452
It doesn’t seem to have hurt his prospects though, and he spent the

00:05:31.452 --> 00:05:36.452
next 7 years as a journalist for the right-wing newspaper, The Daily

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:41.802
Telegraph, mainly writing negative stories about the European Union.

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:48.102
Now, those of you who might be thinking ahead and remembering that

00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:53.692
Boris Johnson later campaigned for Brexit might be thinking that this

00:05:53.732 --> 00:06:00.152
shows some deep integrity, because he had been anti-EU as a young man.

00:06:00.702 --> 00:06:03.772
This, unfortunately, simply isn’t true.

00:06:04.182 --> 00:06:10.362
The stories he wrote at this time were mainly gossip, myths about the

00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:14.762
European Union that he wrote because he knew they would appeal to the

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:19.972
mostly elderly, conservative middle class readers of The Daily Telegraph.

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:28.152
His journalistic career continued until 2001, when he first became a member of parliament

00:06:28.162 --> 00:06:34.732
for the very safe Conservative seat of Henley, an area just to the west of London.

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:39.872
Although he was now an MP, he was now a member of

00:06:39.872 --> 00:06:43.402
parliament, he never really stopped being a journalist.

00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:48.662
He was still the editor of a right-wing magazine called The Spectator, a

00:06:48.662 --> 00:06:54.812
position he had been given in 1999 on the explicit condition that he didn’t

00:06:54.862 --> 00:07:01.452
become a politician, a promise which he broke in 2001 when he did exactly that.

00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:08.002
He was also still a columnist for The Daily Telegraph, writing a weekly

00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:15.912
column and being paid £250,000 a year, so that's over €300,000, to do so.

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:23.512
The theme of being paid enough, of making enough money, will be a recurrent one throughout

00:07:23.562 --> 00:07:30.412
Johnson’s career because, despite coming from a wealthy family and earning what to

00:07:30.412 --> 00:07:36.452
most people would be significant amounts of money, for Johnson it was never enough.

00:07:36.912 --> 00:07:41.182
And this was mainly because he had a lot of expenses.

00:07:42.242 --> 00:07:47.112
By the mid 2000s Johnson was onto his second marriage,

00:07:47.222 --> 00:07:50.363
and had a growing number of children to support.

00:07:51.193 --> 00:07:58.003
He is now, by the way, onto his third marriage and has never actually publicly said how many

00:07:58.013 --> 00:08:03.663
children he has - there are now at least 7 and it’s believed that there are several more.

00:08:04.443 --> 00:08:10.713
So, supporting his family, providing them all with the kind of education that he got,

00:08:11.038 --> 00:08:17.763
which costs over €50,000 per year for every child, obviously was getting expensive.

00:08:18.373 --> 00:08:23.613
So Johnson needed to top up his MPs salary with other work,

00:08:23.993 --> 00:08:27.833
journalism, presenting TV programmes and writing books.

00:08:29.053 --> 00:08:33.663
He became particularly well-known as a frequent commentator on a

00:08:33.693 --> 00:08:38.483
satirical news programme called Have I Got News For You, which I

00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:42.393
would highly recommend to anyone interested in British political life.

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:48.153
But Boris Johnson wasn’t doing all of this just for the money.

00:08:49.233 --> 00:08:54.773
Like Donald Trump, he knew that if he wanted to stand a chance of rising to

00:08:54.773 --> 00:09:01.253
power, people needed to know him, and people needed to feel like they liked him.

00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:07.843
And he was, in the mid 2000s at least, a very popular individual.

00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:14.393
He was viewed as a bit of a clown, as someone not to take seriously,

00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:19.263
someone who would say ridiculous things and not really mean them.

00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:25.073
But because he was only an MP he didn’t really have all

00:09:25.103 --> 00:09:29.073
that much power, there was limited harm that he could do.

00:09:29.973 --> 00:09:34.183
He was popular with his chosen political party, the Conservative

00:09:34.183 --> 00:09:38.923
party, because he seemed approachable, and voters liked him.

00:09:39.953 --> 00:09:45.293
And so when the position of candidate for the mayor of London opened

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:51.723
up in 2007, he jumped at the opportunity, and was duly voted in.

00:09:52.733 --> 00:09:57.003
He was suddenly in charge of one of the most important cities on the

00:09:57.003 --> 00:10:03.163
planet, but that responsibility didn’t really seem to bother Boris Johnson.

00:10:03.613 --> 00:10:07.933
He didn’t change at all, he was still the same Boris Johnson

00:10:07.933 --> 00:10:11.473
who never brushed his hair and didn’t do his homework.

00:10:12.603 --> 00:10:18.883
Accounts from his time as mayor of London describe him as someone who loved big,

00:10:19.123 --> 00:10:26.393
symbolic plans and projects, but had no patience with any of the detail or execution.

00:10:27.453 --> 00:10:34.823
He was, at the heart of it, someone who loved doing speeches and making people laugh, but when

00:10:34.823 --> 00:10:41.913
it came down to the business of actually running the city day-to-day he was slightly bored of it.

00:10:43.273 --> 00:10:49.823
Now, there were some successes that happened under his leadership of London when he was mayor.

00:10:50.363 --> 00:10:56.533
The London Olympics was a resounding success, he implemented a cycle share

00:10:56.563 --> 00:11:02.323
scheme, the so-called “Boris Bikes”, so it was by no means a disaster.

00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:10.563
And it catapulted him to a new kind of fame, he became even more well known.

00:11:11.953 --> 00:11:19.883
He was mayor for two terms, serving from 2008 to 2016, but during the last

00:11:19.893 --> 00:11:26.103
year of being mayor he also got another job, again as a Member of Parliament.

00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:32.253
And this brings us to the next act of Johnson’s career: Brexit.

00:11:33.643 --> 00:11:40.783
Harking back to his training as a journalist, one evening Johnson wrote two newspaper columns.

00:11:41.823 --> 00:11:46.563
One supported the UK’s continued membership of the EU.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:50.413
The other supported leaving the EU.

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:57.753
Johnson wrestled with which one he should publish, with which position he should take.

00:11:58.593 --> 00:12:02.523
Should he be pro-Brexit or should he be anti-Brexit?

00:12:03.533 --> 00:12:08.733
In the end decided to publish the pro-Brexit column, he became

00:12:08.733 --> 00:12:14.403
the public face of Brexit, and the rest is, as they say, history.

00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:19.113
Now, what does this tell us about Boris Johnson?

00:12:19.643 --> 00:12:25.403
It certainly suggests that he could have gone either way, and if he had become the

00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:30.973
face of the Remain campaign perhaps things would have been different, who knows?

00:12:31.723 --> 00:12:35.543
It tells us that he is a gambler, a chancer.

00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:43.123
He wanted political power, and he thought that he had the best chance of it if he

00:12:43.443 --> 00:12:49.503
backed the “rebel” campaign, the campaign that promised to change the status quo.

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:55.643
If this “anti-establishment” campaign won and the country voted

00:12:55.783 --> 00:13:01.163
for Brexit, great, he would acquire significant political capital.

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:09.963
If it didn’t, well, Johnson’s career both as a journalist and as a politician had taught him that

00:13:10.183 --> 00:13:15.983
people quickly forget these sorts of things, and there would be other opportunities in the future.

00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:23.243
His best chance would be if he backed Brexit, and that was exactly what happened.

00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:29.073
When the country did vote for Brexit, in June of 2016,

00:13:29.363 --> 00:13:33.613
he was reportedly surprised, having not expected to win.

00:13:34.443 --> 00:13:40.353
And what did the leader of the Brexit campaign do the day after the Brexit result was announced?

00:13:40.753 --> 00:13:45.703
Did he gather his advisors and start figuring out a plan for what

00:13:45.703 --> 00:13:50.103
to do, or perhaps even what his next political move would be?

00:13:50.923 --> 00:13:51.293
No.

00:13:51.743 --> 00:13:56.203
Apparently, he actually spent the weekend at the ancestral

00:13:56.203 --> 00:14:00.753
home of Lady Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer, playing cricket.

00:14:02.043 --> 00:14:06.693
And Johnson’s failure to plan his next move was actually

00:14:06.873 --> 00:14:10.843
his downfall, or at least delayed his rise to power.

00:14:11.713 --> 00:14:18.093
He was betrayed by his friend, the Conservative Minister Michael Gove, who said he

00:14:18.103 --> 00:14:23.013
wouldn’t support Johnson’s candidacy for the leadership of the Conservative party.

00:14:24.473 --> 00:14:30.183
Johnson was relegated to the position of Foreign Secretary, and he had to

00:14:30.183 --> 00:14:36.203
wait until 2019 to become Prime Minister, taking over from Theresa May.

00:14:37.383 --> 00:14:41.443
Finally, at the age of 55, he had it.

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:48.703
Boris Johnson was the Prime Minister of the UK, he had achieved the pinnacle of political success.

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:55.943
But a Brexit deal was still to be done, and he had still not won a

00:14:55.943 --> 00:15:02.013
general election, and so in December of 2019 he decided to call a

00:15:02.013 --> 00:15:06.643
general election, in order to win a mandate to do what he wanted.

00:15:07.953 --> 00:15:11.873
He won with an overwhelming majority, the largest

00:15:11.903 --> 00:15:15.993
Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher in 1979.

00:15:16.483 --> 00:15:22.073
He had managed to do what no Conservative candidate had done before, and to win

00:15:22.253 --> 00:15:27.263
Conservative seats in the traditional Labour areas in the north of the country.

00:15:28.183 --> 00:15:34.403
Now, we aren’t going to discuss British politics in detail here, but let me just underline

00:15:34.573 --> 00:15:40.773
why this is important when it comes to understanding Boris Johnson’s rise and fall.

00:15:42.243 --> 00:15:49.253
People had seen Boris Johnson all over the TV and the newspapers for the past 15 years.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:56.100
He was a clown, he seemed to get in trouble, he had affairs, he had illegitimate children,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:03.831
his hair was messy, he was overweight, but he seemed, strangely, genuine, he seemed real.

00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:10.899
Unlike other politicians, he didn’t seem to be trying to be anything that he wasn’t, and this

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:18.119
was hugely appealing to people who were tired of what they believed to be “fake” politicians.

00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:25.599
He was also a master of clear, simple messages that he knew would appeal to people.

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:29.749
And his promise was to “Get Brexit Done”.

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:30.609
Simple.

00:16:31.489 --> 00:16:34.319
He did get a Brexit deal, at long last.

00:16:34.469 --> 00:16:37.279
He was popular with the people who had voted for

00:16:37.279 --> 00:16:41.449
him, and he seemed to be delivering on his promises.

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:49.159
Then COVID happened, and this takes us to the last chapter of the saga of Boris Johnson.

00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:54.669
As we have heard, Boris Johnson is not a serious man,

00:16:54.679 --> 00:16:57.509
he isn’t someone who wants to be taken seriously.

00:16:57.969 --> 00:17:05.019
He likes to make people laugh, he wants people to have a good time, he wants people to like him.

00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:12.949
He is also a man who was easily bored by details, a man who doesn't seem to like hard

00:17:13.169 --> 00:17:19.259
work, and preferred talking about what he wanted to do rather than actually doing it.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:25.559
So, not that any politician is ready and prepared to deal

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:29.689
with a pandemic, but Boris Johnson was particularly not so.

00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:34.349
Now, it seems too early to make great judgments on

00:17:34.547 --> 00:17:37.779
how different countries responded to the pandemic.

00:17:38.099 --> 00:17:43.709
But the response of the British government, led by Johnson, was utterly shambolic

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:49.129
to begin with, and the UK had one of the highest numbers of deaths in Europe.

00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:57.709
And it was the pandemic, or rather Johnson’s behaviour during the pandemic, that exposed to many

00:17:57.709 --> 00:18:05.689
people a side of him that they had not seen before, or perhaps had simply known about but ignored.

00:18:07.159 --> 00:18:13.256
Starting in early December of last year, of 2021, reports started to

00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:18.986
come out of parties that had been held at 10 Downing Street, at the Prime

00:18:18.986 --> 00:18:23.132
Minister’s house, while the rest of the country had been in lockdown.

00:18:24.552 --> 00:18:30.132
Johnson initially tried to deny that he had known about them, but when

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:35.762
more evidence started to come to light and even photos of him at these

00:18:35.762 --> 00:18:40.592
parties started to appear, he admitted that he did know about them.

00:18:42.142 --> 00:18:48.512
To make matters worse, one of the parties happened the evening before Prince Phillip’s

00:18:48.522 --> 00:18:55.312
funeral, where the queen was pictured sitting alone, in her mask, mourning her dead husband.

00:18:56.555 --> 00:19:02.842
Johnson tried to claim that they had been work parties, and therefore had technically not

00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:09.442
broken the COVID guidance because they were at work, but the public weren’t falling for it.

00:19:10.718 --> 00:19:16.992
Johnson’s popularity ratings started to slide, they started to go down significantly.

00:19:17.882 --> 00:19:22.602
He had literally made the rules, but he was trying to get around them.

00:19:23.772 --> 00:19:28.512
If you remember the words of his teacher, who said that when Johnson was a

00:19:28.572 --> 00:19:33.612
teenager he thought that the rules didn’t apply to him, it was clear that

00:19:33.612 --> 00:19:39.232
Boris Johnson, despite now being a grown man and Prime Minister of a country

00:19:39.722 --> 00:19:44.602
still thought that he didn’t need to obey the same rules as everyone else.

00:19:45.742 --> 00:19:51.482
This controversy is, as of the time of recording this episode, still ongoing.

00:19:52.372 --> 00:19:57.542
Senior Conservative politicians have called on Johnson to resign, there has

00:19:57.542 --> 00:20:02.812
been a full report into the parties at Downing Street, and Boris Johnson

00:20:03.002 --> 00:20:08.712
has even gone to apologise to the queen in person, like a naughty schoolboy.

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:16.232
He may well think that this scandal will blow over, that it will be yet another episode in

00:20:16.232 --> 00:20:22.822
his life that he is able to escape from, but it certainly seems that significant damage has

00:20:22.822 --> 00:20:29.342
been done, and it will be hard for him to ever be able to fully recover from this controversy.

00:20:30.332 --> 00:20:36.152
The Conservative Party, his political party, is notoriously ruthless.

00:20:36.422 --> 00:20:42.102
It elected him as leader because he was excellent at winning votes, he was popular.

00:20:42.802 --> 00:20:49.762
And he did just that - the Conservative Party won over a new bunch of voters, and this was

00:20:49.762 --> 00:20:57.142
in a large part due to the mass appeal of Boris Johnson as a slightly naughty, cheeky man.

00:20:58.162 --> 00:21:00.392
But now things have changed.

00:21:00.852 --> 00:21:06.342
At the last survey, 73% of the population think that he is doing

00:21:06.482 --> 00:21:12.352
a “bad” job, vs only 22% that say he is doing a “good” job.

00:21:13.112 --> 00:21:17.562
So it might not be today, it might not be tomorrow, it might not even

00:21:17.562 --> 00:21:22.972
be this year, but it is only a matter of time before the next chapter

00:21:23.202 --> 00:21:27.472
in the story of Boris Johnson, his fall as British Prime Minister.

00:21:28.772 --> 00:21:32.262
So that is a quick stroll through the life of Boris Johnson.

00:21:32.492 --> 00:21:35.382
Let’s just pause to assess what we have seen.

00:21:36.532 --> 00:21:43.642
Firstly, it is a life and career full of making stuff up to entertain people and win friends.

00:21:44.312 --> 00:21:49.222
From making up quotes as a journalist through to breaking promises

00:21:49.262 --> 00:21:53.372
about becoming an MP and then breaking the rules about COVID

00:21:53.382 --> 00:21:58.172
restrictions, Boris Johnson has a very loose relationship with the truth.

00:21:59.292 --> 00:22:03.822
This might not have mattered when he was in relatively unimportant

00:22:03.862 --> 00:22:09.282
positions, and people tended to forgive him for it, but it’s something that

00:22:09.282 --> 00:22:13.152
is unforgivable when you are Prime Minister in the middle of a pandemic.

00:22:14.742 --> 00:22:20.722
Secondly, it is that he seems to feel that he holds no responsibility for his actions.

00:22:21.302 --> 00:22:25.702
His father, Stanley Johnson, famously taught Boris that

00:22:26.072 --> 00:22:29.842
“nothing matters very much and most things don’t matter at all.”

00:22:31.012 --> 00:22:36.692
Boris seems to agree, whether it was deciding to be for or against Brexit,

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:42.882
his numerous affairs or even when he caused thousands of pounds of damage at a

00:22:42.892 --> 00:22:47.852
restaurant in Oxford as a student, his attitude is certainly that most things

00:22:47.852 --> 00:22:52.762
don’t matter at all, or at least they can be resolved with a joke and a smile.

00:22:53.962 --> 00:22:58.992
It seems though, with the revelations about the parties he held as the rest

00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:03.972
of the country was barely allowed out of their houses, that Johnson might have

00:23:03.972 --> 00:23:09.622
finally discovered that there are some things that do matter very much indeed.

00:23:12.152 --> 00:23:18.172
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Rise And Fall of Boris Johnson.

00:23:18.562 --> 00:23:23.912
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that this has helped shed a little light on the

00:23:23.912 --> 00:23:29.282
man with the blond hair who you might have wondered how did he ever manage to get to power.

00:23:30.392 --> 00:23:33.772
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:37.602
What do people think about Boris Johnson in your country?

00:23:38.002 --> 00:23:40.122
How has this changed over time?

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:44.292
Do you think he might be able to survive this recent controversy?

00:23:44.732 --> 00:23:48.522
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.050
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.619
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.120
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.360
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we
are going to be talking about a man

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.030
who climbed to the upper echelons
of the British establishment.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.550
A man whose face for decades beamed
into living rooms across Britain

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.960
during a successful television career.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.140
A man instantly recognisable for his
bleached-blonde hair, array of tracksuits

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.850
and jewellery, and the cigar almost
permanently hanging from his mouth.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.510
He was an acclaimed charity worker
and fundraiser who was widely

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.710
viewed as a ‘national treasure’.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.880
And a man who maintained personal
relationships with the British

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.050
Royal Family and the country’s
most powerful politicians.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.760
But, he was also a man
with a very dark side.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.730
A man who committed some of the
most heinous sex crimes in British

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.496
history, and used his influence
and status to avoid punishment.

00:01:18.937 --> 00:01:24.300
A man, or monster, who lived his
entire life hidden in plain sight.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.520
I am talking, of course,
about Jimmy Savile.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.740
So, let’s get right into it and
talk about Jimmy Savile, the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.680
man who tricked the country.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.420
On the 16th of April, 1990, King
Charles III - who was then just plain

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.080
old Prince Charles - wrote to Jimmy
Savile, asking for advice on a speech.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.330
“Can you cast an eye over this draft
and let me know how you think we can

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.030
best appeal to people on this score?”

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.970
“You are so good at understanding
what makes people operate,” the

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.770
King added, “and you're wonderfully
sceptical and practical."

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.500
The letter, it would be revealed many
years later, was just one of hundreds the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.860
future King exchanged with the former-DJ
and charity fundraiser over the years.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.930
But his influence didn’t stop there.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.670
Savile also cultivated close personal
relationships with politicians,

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.060
particularly the former Prime
Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.660
He reportedly celebrated New Year with the
Thatcher family at the Prime Minister’s

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.820
country estate, Chequers, and in the
1980s Thatcher even wrote to Savile to

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.100
reassure him that some of the changes
he wanted to charity funding rules were

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.240
getting her full and personal attention.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.730
Changes that were, in the end,
eventually included in one of

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.130
the British government’s budgets.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.177
This former DJ and nightclub manager
not only advised future kings, but had

00:03:01.177 --> 00:03:03.937
a hand in influencing government policy.

00:03:04.637 --> 00:03:06.407
But how did this happen?

00:03:06.657 --> 00:03:12.577
How did a former coal miner from Leeds, a
man that would later be revealed to be one

00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:18.597
of the worst sexual predators in British
history, rise to such power and influence?

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.760
How did he trick the nation?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.690
How did he get away with it for so long?

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.620
James Wilson Vincent Savile was
born on October the 31st, 1926,

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.600
in Leeds, in the West Riding of
Yorkshire, in northern England.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.100
He was the youngest of seven
children, born to Vincent Joseph

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.010
Savile, a bookmaker's clerk, and
his wife, Agnes Monica Kelly.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.090
Savile was from a working-class
background, in an already not

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.340
wealthy part of the country.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.210
His childhood was so poor, in fact,
that he later claimed that his Christmas

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.350
present was a trip to the shops to
look at toys through the window.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.379
His schooling was brief, ending
at the age of 15, when he left

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.299
to briefly work in an office.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.879
This was right in the middle of
the Second World War, and Savile

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.999
was conscripted to work in coal
mines to support the war effort.

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:23.519
It was dangerous work, and he
had a bad spinal injury, he

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:25.259
damaged the bones in his back.

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:31.929
The injury was so bad, in fact, that
it took him years to be properly back

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:35.829
on his feet, and he was told that
he would never walk properly again.

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:42.737
But recover he did, and once he had
recovered from his injuries Savile

00:04:42.927 --> 00:04:47.977
first became a scrap metal dealer,
before becoming a DJ, playing

00:04:47.977 --> 00:04:50.607
records in dance halls around Leeds.

00:04:51.977 --> 00:04:57.777
Playing the latest releases, and with the
country finally at peace again, Savile’s

00:04:57.787 --> 00:05:02.377
events became a hit and he quickly
started managing a large dance hall.

00:05:03.547 --> 00:05:09.077
By the late 1950s he was running the
entertainment at 45 ballrooms across

00:05:09.077 --> 00:05:14.497
the country, and though popular and
seen as a bit quirky, or a little

00:05:14.497 --> 00:05:19.847
strange, Savile’s no-nonsense approach
to troublemakers at his dance halls

00:05:19.897 --> 00:05:22.337
already revealed his darker side.

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:28.277
Drunks and troublemakers would be,
as Savile would later admit, tied up

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:30.987
in a boiler room and left for hours.

00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:36.927
And even back then, as early as
the 1950s, there were allegations

00:05:36.947 --> 00:05:41.227
about Savile’s behaviour,
particularly towards young girls.

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:46.967
A bouncer, or doorman, in one of
Savile’s Mecca dance halls recalled,

00:05:46.967 --> 00:05:52.827
many years later, that Savile was due
in court for, in his words, "messing

00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:54.537
about with a couple of girls".

00:05:55.657 --> 00:06:00.327
When the bouncer later asked what
happened, he was told: "It never got

00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:02.527
to court - they dropped the charges."

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.110
Asking how he managed to get away with
it, he was told Savile “did what he

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.270
did last time - he paid them off.'"

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.810
If you pay someone off, it means you
pay them money to stop doing something,

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.020
or to avoid talking about something.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:25.890
So, even back then, before his fame,
Savile was, the doorman said, "a very

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.030
powerful man with a lot of influence."

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.090
This influence would only grow when,
in 1958, he moved into radio and

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.500
became a DJ on Radio Luxembourg.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.160
If you’re thinking, hang on, “Radio
Luxembourg” that sounds like a

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.830
strange name, you’d be right.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:51.730
Radio Luxembourg was a radio station
based in Luxembourg, but at this time

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.640
it mainly broadcast to the UK due to a
British law that gave the BBC a monopoly.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.474
So, the point here is that Savile didn’t
suddenly turn into a Luxembourgish

00:07:03.474 --> 00:07:05.744
DJ, his listeners were in the UK.

00:07:07.014 --> 00:07:12.684
And he was soon one of the leading
British DJs on the radio, with 6

00:07:12.684 --> 00:07:18.284
shows a week and his Saturday show
attracting 6 million listeners, more

00:07:18.284 --> 00:07:20.684
than 10% of the country’s population.

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:25.146
But the radio was only the
start for Jimmy Savile.

00:07:25.774 --> 00:07:31.654
In 1960 Savile began working in
the latest media trend, television.

00:07:32.973 --> 00:07:38.195
On the 1st of January, 1964,
Savile presented the first episode

00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:40.575
of Top of the Pops, on the BBC.

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:45.535
If you haven’t heard of Top of the
Pops, it was a weekly show where the

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:47.615
country’s most famous bands would play.

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:52.565
Anyone who was anyone played Top of
the Pops: The Beatles, The Rolling

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:58.075
Stones, David Bowie, Beyonce, Madonna,
the Jackson 5, it was the most famous

00:07:58.265 --> 00:08:03.555
musical programme in the country and
was a pillar of British popular culture

00:08:04.605 --> 00:08:10.005
And Jimmy Saville presented it for
20 years, cementing his position

00:08:10.215 --> 00:08:14.745
as the country’s most famous, and
for some, most loved, TV presenter.

00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:21.355
As his fame grew, Savile began
cultivating his public persona and

00:08:21.585 --> 00:08:27.325
image, draping himself in jewellery
and tracksuits, and becoming known for

00:08:27.325 --> 00:08:30.615
his wacky, slightly strange demeanour.

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:35.415
Alongside this, he was one of
the country’s most notorious

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:41.405
charity fundraisers, doing runs,
setting up charities, and raising

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:45.965
an estimated £40 million pounds,
so almost €50 million Euros for

00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:47.825
charity over the course of his life.

00:08:49.215 --> 00:08:53.705
But as Savile rubbed shoulders with
some of pop music’s biggest stars and

00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:59.765
raised money for good causes, rumours
about his private life - in particular,

00:08:59.775 --> 00:09:04.895
his inappropriate behaviour towards
underage girls - began circulating.

00:09:06.655 --> 00:09:11.215
A man called Roger Holt, a music
industry insider who regularly

00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:15.825
visited the Radio 1 offices during
the 1960s, would later reveal that

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:18.055
everyone knew what Savile was doing.

00:09:19.305 --> 00:09:24.495
Savile, Holt claimed, would invite
“young girls into his Rolls Royce or the

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:26.585
caravan when he was travelling around.”

00:09:27.135 --> 00:09:31.155
It was, Holt said, “an open
secret in the record industry."

00:09:32.085 --> 00:09:38.755
In 1973, with the rumours becoming more
common, the BBC’s press team checked

00:09:38.815 --> 00:09:42.755
with British newspapers whether they were
planning to report on Savile’s behaviour.

00:09:43.705 --> 00:09:49.275
Incredibly, though many newspapers were
aware of the allegations they were not

00:09:49.285 --> 00:09:53.925
going to print them because Savile was
a loved public figure, who had been

00:09:53.925 --> 00:09:55.945
seen to raise so much money for charity.

00:09:56.745 --> 00:10:02.065
In fact, Savile used his charity work
as a means to manipulate the press

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:06.125
into not reporting the allegations
against him, suggesting that they

00:10:06.135 --> 00:10:10.175
would be responsible for the end of
his charity fundraising if they did.

00:10:11.525 --> 00:10:16.525
His quirky public persona combined
with his charity work allowed him

00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:21.975
to hide in plain sight, and his
fund-raising activities also gave

00:10:21.995 --> 00:10:27.965
him easy access to hospitals, schools
and prisons, institutions housing

00:10:27.965 --> 00:10:30.375
some of society’s most vulnerable

00:10:31.425 --> 00:10:36.505
He even had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville
hospital in Buckinghamshire, where his

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:42.362
charitable trust was headquartered, as
well as an office and bedroom at Broadmoor

00:10:42.362 --> 00:10:44.292
psychiatric hospital in Berkshire.

00:10:45.502 --> 00:10:50.092
After his death, it emerged that
both of these sites were where

00:10:50.102 --> 00:10:52.442
many of his crimes had taken place.

00:10:53.742 --> 00:11:00.332
Yet publicly Savile’s profile continued
to grow, and in 1975 he got the job

00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:05.932
that he would be most remembered for
and, sickeningly, would not only endear

00:11:05.932 --> 00:11:10.542
him to, but also give him access to
millions of children across Britain.

00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:16.323
This job was his own TV
show called ‘Jim’ll Fix It’.

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:21.688
It was a children’s TV show
that encouraged kids to write to

00:11:21.698 --> 00:11:25.388
Savile with a wish that would come
true at the end of each episode.

00:11:26.098 --> 00:11:30.018
Jim, Jimmy Savile, would literally
make their dreams come true.

00:11:31.258 --> 00:11:36.338
As you might imagine, kids loved
him, and a generation of young

00:11:36.348 --> 00:11:40.318
Brits grew up wishing for Jim
to make their dreams come true.

00:11:41.548 --> 00:11:46.228
Yet, as he established himself as the
nation’s most popular children’s TV

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:51.948
presenter and mingled with high-society
figures, the rumours of sexual abuse

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:55.258
showed no signs of abating, of dying down.

00:11:56.538 --> 00:12:02.318
Many began to question Savile’s private
life, wondering why such a rich,

00:12:02.518 --> 00:12:08.528
well-known and much-loved celebrity
had always been single and seemed to

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:13.368
prefer to spend his time with children
in hospitals, schools, and prisons.

00:12:14.818 --> 00:12:20.538
Unfortunately, his motives were
far from pure, and I’m sorry but

00:12:20.558 --> 00:12:23.858
this is where I have to go into
some uncomfortable territory.

00:12:25.058 --> 00:12:31.318
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Savile is
alleged to have sexually abused hundreds

00:12:31.338 --> 00:12:36.268
of people, many of them vulnerable
children, all while maintaining his

00:12:36.268 --> 00:12:41.688
public facade, or image, as a wacky
but kind-hearted charity fundraiser.

00:12:42.808 --> 00:12:47.228
There were even rumours of Savile
spending time in hospital mortuaries,

00:12:47.268 --> 00:12:52.138
where dead bodies are kept, and years
later evidence would emerge of his

00:12:52.158 --> 00:12:54.508
unhealthy interest in dead bodies.

00:12:55.318 --> 00:13:00.788
Yet, despite these absolutely vile
rumours and allegations, which were

00:13:00.788 --> 00:13:05.708
now so numerous that they should have
been taken seriously, his career and

00:13:05.728 --> 00:13:07.938
public profile continued to grow.

00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:15.548
In 1988, Savile was even appointed by
the Department of Health to a task force

00:13:15.768 --> 00:13:21.188
overseeing Broadmoor prison, a place where
he habitually abused vulnerable people.

00:13:21.998 --> 00:13:29.388
In 1990 Savile was knighted by the Queen
and made Sir Jimmy Savile for his charity

00:13:29.388 --> 00:13:34.828
work, and he was given a Papal Knighthood
by Pope John Paul II the same year.

00:13:35.698 --> 00:13:40.388
It would later transpire that his friend,
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, had

00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:45.528
repeatedly tried to get him knighted
back in the 1980s despite the widespread

00:13:45.528 --> 00:13:47.328
concerns about his private life.

00:13:48.508 --> 00:13:53.278
Some have speculated that Savile’s
endless charity work was a means of

00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:58.018
misdirection, of making people think
that he was doing all of this good work,

00:13:58.208 --> 00:14:02.878
raising all of this money for charity,
so surely he couldn’t be an evil man.

00:14:03.898 --> 00:14:08.418
His fundraising, some say, was done
with the aim of getting his knighthood

00:14:08.828 --> 00:14:13.548
- something Savile hoped would make him
untouchable, as it would have been so

00:14:13.588 --> 00:14:18.458
embarrassing for the British establishment
to admit that someone it had made a Sir

00:14:18.658 --> 00:14:20.948
would have committed such atrocious acts.

00:14:22.098 --> 00:14:27.748
Others have speculated that, given that
he was a devout Catholic, doing all of

00:14:27.748 --> 00:14:33.798
this “good work”, the charity work, was a
way of atoning for his sins, so that the

00:14:33.798 --> 00:14:36.708
good would counterbalance all of the evil.

00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:42.788
Whatever his motivations, it’s
clear that he was a monster hiding

00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:46.788
in plain sight, hiding on the
country's television screens.

00:14:47.738 --> 00:14:50.128
So, how did he get away with it?

00:14:50.698 --> 00:14:55.318
The warning signs were clearly there,
there were plenty of accusations,

00:14:55.498 --> 00:15:00.228
and he almost seemed to publicly
admit to it when he was asked, saying

00:15:00.238 --> 00:15:03.698
things like "I’m feared in every
girls' school in this country."

00:15:04.428 --> 00:15:08.968
He would almost shock people with
his responses that seemed so horrible

00:15:08.998 --> 00:15:11.908
they couldn’t be true, but they were.

00:15:13.238 --> 00:15:17.118
So, to go back to our earlier
question, how did he get away with it?

00:15:17.588 --> 00:15:22.978
Well, one theory is that he was
simply too famous, too loved.

00:15:23.918 --> 00:15:29.118
As a national treasure and a public
face of the BBC, even those who

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:33.618
knew or suspected what he was up
to were too afraid to speak out.

00:15:34.848 --> 00:15:39.388
In an inquiry released after his
death, it was concluded that BBC

00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:44.098
bosses were “more worried about their
reputation than the safety of children.”

00:15:45.218 --> 00:15:51.598
Yet, during the 2000s Savile’s reputation
began to change from oddball, or

00:15:51.718 --> 00:15:54.538
strange person, to creepy old man.

00:15:55.358 --> 00:16:00.468
Remember, he was born in 1926,
so he is almost in his 80s now.

00:16:01.748 --> 00:16:07.978
In a documentary made in the year 2000,
the filmmaker Louis Theroux visited

00:16:07.988 --> 00:16:12.258
one of Savile’s homes and discovered
his morbid obsession with his mother

00:16:12.568 --> 00:16:15.108
almost 30 years after she had died.

00:16:16.508 --> 00:16:21.248
Savile, it was revealed, still kept
his mother’s clothes in her wardrobe

00:16:21.398 --> 00:16:25.698
as they had been when she had died,
and had remained alone with her

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:28.268
dead body for 5 days after her death

00:16:29.508 --> 00:16:35.098
In the documentary, Theroux also directly
challenged Savile on the long-standing

00:16:35.128 --> 00:16:37.218
allegations of his paedophilia.

00:16:38.438 --> 00:16:40.658
“How do they know whether I am or not?"

00:16:41.048 --> 00:16:41.798
Savile responded.

00:16:42.058 --> 00:16:44.258
"How does anybody know whether I am?

00:16:44.538 --> 00:16:47.018
"Nobody knows,” he said,
“whether I am or not.”

00:16:48.428 --> 00:16:51.789
It certainly seems a strange way
of responding to the question,

00:16:51.939 --> 00:16:54.109
he never actually denied it.

00:16:55.499 --> 00:17:00.299
By this time though, the police
had sufficient evidence to bring

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:04.509
Savile to court, but no charges
were ever brought against him.

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:11.579
In 2008 Savile was named in a police
investigation into child abuse at a

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:17.276
children's home in Jersey, but…nothing
came of it, and in 2009 the Crown

00:17:17.306 --> 00:17:21.686
Prosecution Service investigated
four allegations against him from the

00:17:21.696 --> 00:17:25.016
1970s, but did not pursue the case.

00:17:25.816 --> 00:17:31.376
Savile was even interviewed under police
caution but claimed the victims invented

00:17:31.376 --> 00:17:33.166
the crimes to get money from him.

00:17:34.306 --> 00:17:38.896
As always, for one of the most
recognisable faces on British TV,

00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:41.086
the allegations had no impact.

00:17:41.916 --> 00:17:45.576
And they never would, at
least when he was alive.

00:17:46.906 --> 00:17:53.696
On the 29th of October, 2011, two
days before his 85th birthday, in his

00:17:53.706 --> 00:17:56.846
flat in Leeds, Savile was found dead.

00:17:58.096 --> 00:18:02.346
Almost immediately afterwards, a
flood of allegations emerged from

00:18:02.346 --> 00:18:06.696
victims who had been too scared to
come forward while Savile was alive.

00:18:07.806 --> 00:18:13.246
The details of their claims, as well
as the sheer number of them, rocked

00:18:13.436 --> 00:18:15.426
the British establishment to its core.

00:18:16.586 --> 00:18:23.196
By October of 2012, the police were
investigating 400 potential lines

00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:26.356
of inquiry with over 200 witnesses.

00:18:27.216 --> 00:18:32.566
The allegations against Savile, police
said, were "on an unprecedented scale".

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:38.176
There were far too many for there to be
any doubt that this man was one of the

00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:41.516
country’s most prolific sex offenders.

00:18:42.876 --> 00:18:48.916
By November, the number of alleged
victims had risen to 450, and the

00:18:48.936 --> 00:18:54.306
police were investigating 199 crimes
in 17 different parts of the country.

00:18:55.076 --> 00:18:58.666
And this is only people who have
come forward and said something

00:18:59.096 --> 00:19:03.856
- presumably for everyone who has come
forward and said they were abused by

00:19:03.856 --> 00:19:06.176
Savile, there are many, many more.

00:19:07.456 --> 00:19:12.386
Chillingly, 80 percent of the victims
were children or teenagers at the

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:16.976
time, and there are reports of
completely horrible things, including

00:19:17.386 --> 00:19:19.806
necrophilia, having sex with dead people.

00:19:20.736 --> 00:19:26.976
This clearly put the BBC, the national
broadcaster and an organisation that had

00:19:26.976 --> 00:19:32.616
employed and protected Savile for half
a century, in a complicated position.

00:19:33.686 --> 00:19:37.276
It shouldn’t have been complicated,
you could rightly say, and

00:19:37.446 --> 00:19:41.096
the behaviour of the BBC would
come to be deeply criticised.

00:19:42.166 --> 00:19:46.936
In the aftermath of his death,
journalists at the BBC began an

00:19:46.936 --> 00:19:53.666
investigation into how he was allowed
to go unchecked for so long, but instead

00:19:53.676 --> 00:19:59.026
of supporting this investigation,
BBC bosses ordered the journalists

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:01.256
to stop looking into the allegations.

00:20:02.106 --> 00:20:08.746
Instead, on the 11th of November the
BBC aired a tribute to Savile, and

00:20:08.796 --> 00:20:13.986
the BBC itself became the subject of
investigations by other media outlets.

00:20:14.486 --> 00:20:18.056
It turned out that the
BBC had protected Savile.

00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:24.476
Senior BBC staff knew what he was
doing, almost certainly, but stopped

00:20:24.526 --> 00:20:28.356
any investigations because they were
afraid of the reputational damage

00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:29.856
it could cause the institution.

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:36.146
As more and more allegations emerged,
BBC bosses were forced to step down,

00:20:36.216 --> 00:20:40.586
or resign, and police investigations
continued across the country.

00:20:41.206 --> 00:20:45.386
Questions were asked of top
politicians and the Royal Family.

00:20:45.726 --> 00:20:50.016
How was it possible that Savile
had moved in such powerful

00:20:50.026 --> 00:20:52.556
circles and nobody had known?

00:20:53.866 --> 00:20:57.986
Many in Britain simply refused
to believe it, did people

00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:59.586
really not suspect anything?

00:21:00.247 --> 00:21:05.367
There were calls for his knighthood to be
withdrawn, and episodes of Top of the Pops

00:21:05.417 --> 00:21:08.087
presented by Savile were taken off screen.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:13.937
Finally, after decades of sexual
abuse and peadophilia, the real

00:21:14.087 --> 00:21:15.697
Jimmy Savile had come to light.

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:21.397
He might have died before earthly
justice could be done, but after

00:21:21.397 --> 00:21:25.567
his death there could be no doubt
about the extent of his crimes.

00:21:25.987 --> 00:21:27.536
He could hide no more.

00:21:28.316 --> 00:21:33.446
The man who had tricked, or groomed,
an entire nation - including its royal

00:21:33.446 --> 00:21:38.196
family and political elites - had
been revealed for who he really was:

00:21:38.596 --> 00:21:41.786
a monster hiding in plain sight.

00:21:44.196 --> 00:21:48.736
OK Then, that is it for today’s
episode on Jimmy Savile, the

00:21:48.886 --> 00:21:50.346
man who tricked a nation.

00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:54.696
It's an uncomfortable subject, I
know, but it’s an important one.

00:21:55.226 --> 00:21:59.656
It’s also completely mad to think
how a man who was the most famous TV

00:21:59.656 --> 00:22:04.846
presenter in the country by a huge margin
was never truly brought to justice.

00:22:05.646 --> 00:22:08.756
As always, I would love to know
what you thought about this episode.

00:22:09.136 --> 00:22:10.926
Had you heard about Jimmy Savile before?

00:22:11.256 --> 00:22:15.156
Why do you think he never faced
any consequences for his actions,

00:22:15.326 --> 00:22:16.836
despite the rumours about him?

00:22:17.316 --> 00:22:20.786
And what do you think this
says about British society?

00:22:21.436 --> 00:22:24.566
I would love to know, so let’s
get this discussion started.

Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:17.346
English, the show where you can learn fascinating things about the world and listen to amazing

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:21.156
stories, at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:29.406
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the man who cracked the Nazis' code.

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:37.671
It is said that knowledge is power, and if you know what your enemy is planning to do, well, that's

00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:39.891
certainly a powerful thing indeed.

00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:48.471
So stay tuned, we are going to talk about the man who managed to decipher the encrypted messages of

00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:57.152
the German army, and according to some, was a big, albeit relatively unknown, factor in the allied

00:00:57.152 --> 00:00:58.832
victory in World War Two.

00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:06.677
Before we do that though, let me just take 30 seconds to remind you that you can get a copy of the

00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:12.917
transcript and key vocabulary for this episode and all the other episodes for that matter, over on

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:15.607
the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:23.237
The transcript is super helpful for following along, and the key vocabulary explains the harder

00:01:23.237 --> 00:01:29.537
words and means that you can build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:37.697
So if that sounds like a good idea, and it certainly does to me, then head to Leonardoenglish.com to

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:38.237
check it out.

00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:42.907
Okay then let's get back into it.

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:51.947
Centuries ago, when armies used to face each other on the battlefield, things were quite a bit

00:01:51.947 --> 00:01:52.487
simpler.

00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:59.882
Yes, there was obviously a lot of strategy and skill involved, but battles were normally

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:01.922
geographically quite contained.

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:09.602
They might stretch out over a few square miles, but generally not over hundreds of miles or

00:02:09.602 --> 00:02:10.772
thousands of miles.

00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:18.662
And if they did stretch out that far, getting information about your plans to your soldiers or to

00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:20.472
your allies, it took a while.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:29.671
A messenger had to physically travel there, and horses, well, they can only run so fast.

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:36.061
With the invention of radio, things became a little easier.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:43.815
You could pick up a radio and tell your fellow soldiers or your allies what your plans were.

00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:52.315
Great on one level, but it also meant that you could be overheard if someone else was listening in.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.210
And with the invention of things like aeroplanes, tanks and warships, battles were fought over even

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.350
larger distances.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.970
Knowing what your allies were up to and being able to communicate your plans to them, it was

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.230
absolutely vital.

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:22.354
The Germans at the start of the Second World War had developed a military tactic called Blitzkrieg.

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:27.844
It literally means "lightning war" or "lightning attack" in German.

00:03:29.153 --> 00:03:36.263
It involved a fast attack on the enemy with soldiers, tanks and air support.

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:44.730
Doing that effectively relied on good communication between all of the different parties involved.

00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:53.191
And of course there wasn't any WhatsApp, mobile phones or anything like that, this was the 1930s.

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:59.131
What there was, if you wanted instant communication, was radio.

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:07.621
But of course if you radio in to your colleagues, even if you are speaking a different language, you

00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:13.806
can bet your enemies will be listening in and trying to understand what you're saying, so that they

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:17.136
can be prepared for whatever you have in store.

00:04:18.637 --> 00:04:26.347
So the Germans needed a way of encrypting their messages, of making the actual meaning of what they

00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:33.737
were saying unknown for anyone who didn't have the key to unlock the meaning, to unlock the code.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:42.390
Luckily for them, a German company called Scherbius and Ritter had been working on a machine that

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.500
did exactly that.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:53.460
It was called the Enigma machine, and they had been working on it since shortly after the end of the

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.390
First World War.

00:04:56.107 --> 00:05:02.919
Without going into all of the details about how it worked, partly because they are incredibly

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:10.137
complicated and it would take a long time to explain, and also partly because I have to admit that

00:05:10.257 --> 00:05:16.244
even though I understand the principles, I don't fully understand everything I will just explain

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.254
briefly how the machine worked.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:24.879
The sender would write down the letters of the message that they wanted to send.

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:33.239
That message - the letters of that message - would then be passed to the operator of the Enigma

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:33.689
machine.

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:40.481
That operator would press in the letters from the message into the machine.

00:05:41.662 --> 00:05:50.207
Each time a letter was pressed a light would come on on the machine and this light would correspond

00:05:50.237 --> 00:05:51.617
to a different letter.

00:05:52.667 --> 00:06:01.517
For example, if I pressed the letter C, the light for A might come on, and then another operator

00:06:01.537 --> 00:06:03.527
would write down the letter A.

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:08.296
I guess you're thinking, well, that sounds quite easy actually.

00:06:08.626 --> 00:06:15.796
Surely, if you can just figure out which letter corresponds to which other letter, then anyone can

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:16.666
crack the code.

00:06:17.996 --> 00:06:19.796
Well, not so fast.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.341
Every time a letter was pressed, the pattern would change and the code would change.

00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:31.591
So if you pressed C again, it could be any other letter.

00:06:33.457 --> 00:06:40.723
After the entire message had been transformed into these new letters, the message with the new

00:06:40.723 --> 00:06:44.533
letters would be sent, normally by Morse code.

00:06:46.813 --> 00:06:54.643
And when the message was received, if the person had an Enigma machine with the identical settings,

00:06:55.183 --> 00:06:59.983
then they could type in the message and get the encrypted letters back out.

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:07.488
If you didn't have a machine, there was no way to guess, the message would just look like random

00:07:07.488 --> 00:07:07.908
letters.

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:16.394
And these settings would be changed frequently, so even if someone was listening in, which of course

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:19.865
they were, they wouldn't be able to easily see a pattern.

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:25.935
So obviously it was incredibly difficult to break.

00:07:27.124 --> 00:07:35.553
However, before the official outbreak of World War II, a group of brilliant Polish mathematicians

00:07:35.943 --> 00:07:39.393
had figured out how to read part of the machine.

00:07:39.843 --> 00:07:41.573
They had partly broken the code.

00:07:43.743 --> 00:07:51.609
When the Germans realised that this had happened, that their code had been semi-compromised, they

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:54.579
made the machine quite a lot more complicated.

00:07:55.479 --> 00:08:02.559
And so while the Poles had been able to read a large number of messages, they could now only read

00:08:02.559 --> 00:08:05.259
messages sent by the older machines.

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:07.929
So it wasn't nearly quite as effective.

00:08:09.116 --> 00:08:17.961
By the time it got to 1939 and it was clear that war was going to break out any minute, the Polish

00:08:17.961 --> 00:08:23.121
mathematicians decided to share their work with the British and French.

00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:30.651
They could see that they would only have a short window of time before Poland was completely

00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:36.651
occupied by the Germans, and then there would be no way to get the message out.

00:08:37.937 --> 00:08:42.917
So they shared their learnings with British and French codebreakers.

00:08:44.296 --> 00:08:50.625
And this work that they did, the work done by the Polish mathematicians, was incredibly important

00:08:50.775 --> 00:08:58.395
for understanding how the machines worked, and they even shared real copies that they had made of

00:08:58.395 --> 00:09:00.315
the machine with their new allies.

00:09:01.993 --> 00:09:10.973
And back in the UK, there was a top secret team assembled of scientists, mathematicians, and

00:09:10.973 --> 00:09:11.903
codebreakers.

00:09:14.023 --> 00:09:21.618
The focus was to break this code, to try and understand the system that the Nazis were using, so

00:09:21.618 --> 00:09:28.188
that the allied troops could be warned of an impending attack, so they could know their enemy's

00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:29.838
plans in advance.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:39.551
This secret group had its headquarters at a place called Bletchley Park to the northwest of London.

00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:49.081
And a key part of that group, the hero of today's episode, was a man called Alan Turing.

00:09:50.603 --> 00:09:57.020
cHe was born in 1912 and so was only in his late twenties when he joined Bletchley Park.

00:09:57.943 --> 00:10:03.143
Turing was an incredibly gifted individual, a very talented mathematician.

00:10:04.229 --> 00:10:10.614
He had studied at Cambridge and Princeton, and was considered by many to be one of the finest

00:10:10.614 --> 00:10:14.454
mathematicians and computer scientists of his era.

00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:18.414
He was also a very eccentric individual.

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:26.564
His office was in a place called Milton Keynes, which is about 40 miles or 60 kilometres from

00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:27.074
London.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:34.329
When he was occasionally called to meetings in London, he would run to London instead of taking the

00:10:34.329 --> 00:10:34.779
train.

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:37.929
That's like one and a half marathons.

00:10:39.111 --> 00:10:49.502
Also, reportedly, he used to attach his mug, his cup for tea, to a radiator with a chain in order to

00:10:49.502 --> 00:10:51.842
prevent it being used by his colleagues.

00:10:53.288 --> 00:11:01.795
In any case, while he was at Bletchley Park, his sole focus was on code breaking, on deciphering the

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:06.565
messages that were sent by the Germans through these Enigma machines.

00:11:07.999 --> 00:11:17.589
And by the time that Turing started in Bletchley Park, the German U-boats, the submarines, were

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:20.019
causing havoc in the Atlantic.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:30.539
They were sinking allied ships by the dozen and it was very difficult to resupply some of the troops

00:11:30.659 --> 00:11:31.829
in Western Europe.

00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:40.356
Being able to anticipate the movements of the U-boats and avoid them was crucial.

00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:48.412
Turing developed a series of machines that cracked this code using incredibly complicated

00:11:48.412 --> 00:11:57.086
mathematics and cryptography And the result was that they were able to decipher a large number of

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:59.396
the Nazis' encrypted messages.

00:12:00.572 --> 00:12:08.229
its of course, hard to say how many lives this saved, but it's acknowledged that the work of Turing

00:12:08.469 --> 00:12:16.599
and his team of codebreakers was incredibly important for winning the Battle of the Atlantic and for

00:12:16.599 --> 00:12:19.809
ensuring an eventual allied victory.

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:28.553
After the war, Turing moved to London and then took up a position at the University of Manchester

00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:31.583
where he worked on artificial intelligence.

00:12:33.943 --> 00:12:41.623
You might know artificial intelligence as a bit of a buzzword at the moment, but Turing was working

00:12:41.623 --> 00:12:44.023
on it over 70 years ago now.

00:12:45.853 --> 00:12:54.050
And if the name 'Turing' rings a bell, if you recognise the name, it may be from The Turing Test,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:01.190
the test used to define whether a machine is 'intelligent', in inverted commas.

00:13:02.145 --> 00:13:10.765
Essentially, if a human can tell a machine apart from a human, then it is deemed to be intelligent.

00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:19.246
But, and I'm afraid that there is a but here, the story of Alan Turing, the man who cracked the

00:13:19.246 --> 00:13:22.636
Nazis' code doesn't have a happy ending.

00:13:24.286 --> 00:13:29.871
He was gay and this was still a crime in Britain, even in 1950.

00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:38.289
After he admitted to the police that he was involved in a homosexual relationship, he was arrested

00:13:38.619 --> 00:13:49.635
for what's called gross indecency, and he was given a choice, either go to prison or agree to have

00:13:49.875 --> 00:13:51.315
chemical castration.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:14:01.140
Basically to be given oestrogen injections to reduce his libido, injections to try and stop him

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.810
having sexual desires towards men.

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:13.464
He accepted the chemical castration, and he predicted that, in his own words, he predicted that, "no

00:14:13.464 --> 00:14:19.884
doubt, I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out."

00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:24.854
This process was obviously horrible.

00:14:25.634 --> 00:14:30.734
It caused him to go impotent and caused breast tissue to form.

00:14:32.217 --> 00:14:37.260
And he was found dead two years later, poisoned by cyanide.

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:45.216
And although it's widely agreed that he killed himself, there are all sorts of other theories about

00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:52.476
what happened, including that he was killed by the British government because he knew too much about

00:14:52.656 --> 00:15:00.246
Britain's secret espionage activity and was liable to be compromised by the Soviets.

00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:08.939
Whatever you believe, it was a tragic end for a man who had played such an important role in saving

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:15.029
so many lives and had had such an impact on the allied war effort.

00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:25.236
55 years later, in 2009 the British Prime Minister at the time, Gordon Brown, issued an official

00:15:25.236 --> 00:15:33.636
apology for Turing, saying that the treatment he had received was appalling, which it obviously was.

00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:43.503
However, he wasn't technically pardoned by Gordon Brown, he wasn't absolved of his crimes.

00:15:45.093 --> 00:15:52.893
The reason being that homosexuality technically was a crime at the time, and according to the

00:15:52.893 --> 00:16:00.273
British government, you can't pardon someone if they are guilty of a crime, even if that crime is

00:16:00.273 --> 00:16:11.082
now completely legal But then in 2013, after a big public effort, he did get a posthumous pardon, an

00:16:11.102 --> 00:16:15.902
official pardon from none other than the Queen of England.

00:16:17.221 --> 00:16:24.451
And something called The Turing Law, or Alan Turing Law has been introduced.

00:16:25.514 --> 00:16:32.114
This law essentially pardoned thousands of gay men who had been convicted when homosexuality was

00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:33.044
still illegal.

00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:41.638
And so all of these men who had been either sent to prison or had been sentenced in some way

00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:43.948
received an automatic pardon.

00:16:45.908 --> 00:16:53.558
So although I said that the story doesn't have a happy ending, and of course this pardon doesn't

00:16:53.648 --> 00:17:01.448
make up for the terrible way in which Turing was treated, it is at least better than nothing and has

00:17:01.448 --> 00:17:06.878
helped raise awareness of the fantastic work that was done by Alan Turing.

00:17:09.748 --> 00:17:16.048
Okay then, that is it for Alan Turing, the man who cracked the Nazis' code.

00:17:17.258 --> 00:17:19.298
It is a fascinating story.

00:17:19.668 --> 00:17:27.078
He was obviously just an incredible, brilliant man, And of course it is a tragedy how he was treated

00:17:27.678 --> 00:17:28.698
by the British government.

00:17:30.438 --> 00:17:37.728
As always, if you have thoughts, feedback, questions, or anything you want to say, then I would love

00:17:37.728 --> 00:17:38.658
to hear from you.

00:17:39.108 --> 00:17:44.838
I've heard from students in Russia, English teachers in Colombia, entrepreneurs from Italy,

00:17:44.868 --> 00:17:48.858
podcasters from Switzerland, and people from all over the world.

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:51.428
And I would of course, love to hear from you.

00:17:52.118 --> 00:17:56.688
So the email is hi@Leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:58.168 --> 00:18:05.098
And as a final reminder for the transcript, key vocabulary and bonus podcasts, then the place to

00:18:05.098 --> 00:18:07.518
head to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:18:09.318 --> 00:18:13.758
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

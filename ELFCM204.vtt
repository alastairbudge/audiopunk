00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:20.609
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:27.326
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three part mini-series on Brexit.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.788
In Part One, which was one of our member-only episodes, we covered

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.358
the history of Britain’s complicated relationship with Europe.

00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:43.108
In Part three, which will be another member-only one and is coming out next week, we’ll

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:49.208
talk about the aftermath of the Brexit vote, what has actually happened since and how

00:00:49.358 --> 00:00:55.319
has it compared to the predictions made by both those who were for and against Brexit.

00:00:55.779 --> 00:01:00.739
And in today’s episode, part two, we are going to cover the vote itself.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:07.059
We’ll talk about the run up to the vote, why the UK held a referendum on EU membership

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:13.538
in the first place, the campaigns that were run both for and against, how people

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.589
voted, and for what reasons, and why it was that the Leave vote that proved victorious.

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.609

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.951
OK then, the Brexit vote.

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:30.441
If you listened to the last episode, you will remember that Britain has had a

00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:36.421
long, close, and complicated relationship with Europe for the past two millennia.

00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:44.328
Britain had been part of the European Community, the predecessor to the EU, since 1973.

00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:50.541
Relations hadn’t always been smooth, but it was considered by at least

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:55.591
those in power in Britain to have been a relationship of mutual benefit.

00:02:56.351 --> 00:03:01.752
So when it was announced that the UK was to hold a referendum on EU

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:07.122
membership, it wasn’t considered by most people to be such a big deal.

00:03:07.932 --> 00:03:12.522
Indeed, it wasn’t the first time that the UK had held a referendum

00:03:12.532 --> 00:03:16.932
on membership of the European Union - there was a referendum on the

00:03:16.932 --> 00:03:24.962
European Community in 1975, and 67% of people in the UK voted to remain.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:33.362
Up until the more recent referendum vote was announced, which was only in 2015, a year

00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:40.622
before the actual referendum, the EU was a relatively minor issue for most people in the UK.

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:49.642
So, how did the country go from here to being consumed and divided over EU membership?

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:57.582
And how did almost every commentator and person in power, be that the British Prime

00:03:57.582 --> 00:04:05.292
Minister David Cameron or the then US President Barack Obama, get it so badly wrong?

00:04:06.582 --> 00:04:13.252
Let’s start by talking about why the UK even held a Brexit referendum in the first place.

00:04:14.452 --> 00:04:17.882
Throughout history, as we heard about in the previous episode,

00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:22.872
Britain had a slightly sceptical attitude towards Europe.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:30.012
It enjoyed the benefits of closer ties with Europe, but was never completely European.

00:04:31.152 --> 00:04:36.882
Many people in Britain were deeply sceptical about closer ties with Europe, as they believed

00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:43.072
that this would require Britain to give up control, to lose control over its own destiny.

00:04:44.308 --> 00:04:53.598
Despite the UK joining the EEC, the precursor to the EU in 1973, and then Britons voting by a

00:04:53.608 --> 00:05:02.868
large margin to remain in the EEC in 1975, these Eurosceptic feelings never completely went away.

00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:09.686
For many years it was mainly a technical question among right-wing politicians,

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:15.666
but in the early 21st century, and especially the decade before the Brexit

00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:21.316
vote, these feelings crept closer and closer into the public sphere.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:27.006
There were an increasing number of anti-Europe political groups, the

00:05:27.006 --> 00:05:33.646
main populist one being the UK Independent Party or UKIP, for short.

00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:41.946
It was led by one of the most controversial and divisive politicians in the country – a populist,

00:05:42.206 --> 00:05:50.206
anti-immigration and anti-EU campaigner and member of the European Parliament called Nigel Farage.

00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:55.806
Like him or loathe him, he drew the crowds, he was popular,

00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:00.546
and seen as much more approachable than normal politicians.

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:08.709
Farage would often be photographed in a pub with a pint of British beer, wearing British

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:15.879
Barbour jackets, smoking cigarettes, and behaving in a way that wasn’t typical for politicians.

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.059
This approach was hugely successful.

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.409
UKIP continued to grow.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:30.689
In 2009 it received 16.5% of the votes in the European Parliament Elections, then it

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:39.467
received 3.9 million votes, which was a 12.6% share in the UK 2015 General election,

00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:45.997
and it was clear that its message was appealing to a certain part of the UK population.

00:06:47.297 --> 00:06:53.750
After David Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010, he thought he could kill two

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.550
birds with one stone by offering a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.050
Firstly, it would placate the Eurosceptic element of his own party, the

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.400
Conservative party, and strengthen Cameron’s position as leader of the party.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:19.160
It would also attract more right-wing voters who would otherwise vote for UKIP.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.610
Plus, for most people, or so Cameron thought, EU membership

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:30.530
is an unimportant, simply bureaucratic part of their lives.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.930
Surveys done the years before the Brexit vote was announced suggested that

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.880
only 1% of people in Britain actually thought EU membership was an important

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.990
factor, and the last time the government had asked the British people for their

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:54.960
views on Europe in the 1975 referendum, 67% had said they wanted to remain.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.820
What’s more, the British people had voted with the government on every

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:06.760
single referendum vote, and David Cameron had recently won the 2010 general

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.500
election and the referendum on Scottish independence had also gone his way.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.390
So, when the Conservatives were up for re-election in 2015, Cameron

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.350
decided to make a referendum on EU membership part of his manifesto.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.000
Vote Conservative, he said, and we will hold a referendum.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.180
It was a gamble, but one he seemed confident would go his way.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.610
It would end up costing him his political career, and

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.140
be described as "indescribably selfish recklessness."

00:08:45.255 --> 00:08:48.367
Now, let’s move on to the vote itself.

00:08:49.177 --> 00:08:56.337
After pledging to hold a referendum on EU membership, the stage was set for an electoral campaign.

00:08:57.217 --> 00:09:02.967
But the campaign on EU membership was unlike any normal political campaign.

00:09:03.937 --> 00:09:08.897
For starters, the campaigns weren’t divided along party lines.

00:09:10.007 --> 00:09:16.507
Because he was confident that Remain would win and therefore his position would be strengthened,

00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:23.867
Cameron allowed Conservative MPs to decide for themselves whether to support Brexit or not.

00:09:24.774 --> 00:09:31.617
Many chose to go against Cameron, joining the Leave campaign, the campaign to exit the EU.

00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:37.747
They were also joined by politicians from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP.

00:09:38.897 --> 00:09:43.247
And the Remain campaign also had people from across the

00:09:43.247 --> 00:09:48.417
political spectrum, many of whom were there somewhat reluctantly.

00:09:49.287 --> 00:09:55.737
Not least the leader of the Conservatives, David Cameron, and the leader of Labour, Jeremy Corbyn.

00:09:56.337 --> 00:10:02.977
Both had expressed Eurosceptic views in the past, and both were fierce political

00:10:03.027 --> 00:10:08.897
enemies and clearly disliked each other, so it was not particularly convincing.

00:10:09.947 --> 00:10:16.017
For someone like Jeremy Corbyn, who also thought that the Remain campaign was likely to

00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:24.037
win, there was little value in forming an alliance with his mortal enemy, David Cameron - he

00:10:24.037 --> 00:10:29.327
might have wanted Remain to win, but he didn’t want to make David Cameron look good.

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:37.667
And when it came to the main messaging of the Remain camp, they didn’t tend to mention any of

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:45.607
the benefits of EU membership, but instead focussed on the unnecessary risks of leaving the EU.

00:10:46.577 --> 00:10:51.277
Leaving the EU would be a jump into the darkness, leaping into

00:10:51.277 --> 00:10:55.897
the unknown, and a choice that would make everyone poorer.

00:10:57.077 --> 00:11:04.187
Bankers, economists and politicians did projections of what the cost of leaving the EU would be.

00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:11.087
The UK Treasury, essentially the Ministry of Finance, even provided a real number

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:16.457
of what Brexit would cost the average household in the UK every single year.

00:11:17.412 --> 00:11:22.462
£4,300, which was around €6,000 at the time.

00:11:23.512 --> 00:11:30.712
The overall message was, “yes, the EU might not be perfect, but it’s not so bad, and

00:11:30.882 --> 00:11:36.792
voting to leave means risking everything and you’ll probably end up a lot poorer”.

00:11:38.022 --> 00:11:42.912
It’s easy to say this with the benefit of hindsight, but this message

00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:47.922
simply wasn’t sufficiently convincing to much of the UK population.

00:11:48.972 --> 00:11:54.832
The Leave campaign, on the other hand, was significantly better organised, and

00:11:54.962 --> 00:12:00.062
had a much better understanding of what people actually wanted and cared about.

00:12:00.782 --> 00:12:05.052
Instead of trying to scare people into a decision, its

00:12:05.052 --> 00:12:09.547
key messages were a mixture of emotional and practical.

00:12:10.257 --> 00:12:14.917
And ultimately, it all came down to a simple word: control.

00:12:16.077 --> 00:12:20.317
At almost any time anyone from the Leave campaign was talking about

00:12:20.357 --> 00:12:26.277
Brexit, everything revolved around the idea of taking back control.

00:12:26.817 --> 00:12:29.397
Taking back control of British borders.

00:12:29.547 --> 00:12:32.757
Taking back control of decisions within the government.

00:12:33.047 --> 00:12:36.567
Taking back control of where British taxes are spent.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:43.927
They didn’t really compete on the argument of whether or not Brexit would make the UK poorer,

00:12:44.107 --> 00:12:52.207
instead putting all the focus on self-sovereignty and almost suggesting or at least admitting

00:12:52.547 --> 00:12:58.897
that it was better to be independent and a little bit poorer than controlled by Europe.

00:12:59.817 --> 00:13:05.977
The Leave campaign knew that this idea of self-control was very important to British

00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:11.767
voters, and used it effectively, especially when combined with something else that

00:13:11.777 --> 00:13:19.666
British people have an almost unbreakable love for: The National Health Service, the NHS.

00:13:20.577 --> 00:13:26.417
The Leave campaign made spending on the NHS a vital part of its campaign,

00:13:26.687 --> 00:13:33.277
even painting a bus with the message that the UK sends £350 million a

00:13:33.277 --> 00:13:38.647
week to the EU, and that we can spend that money on the NHS instead.

00:13:39.487 --> 00:13:46.427
Now, that number was proved to be incorrect, it was a great exaggeration of the real amount,

00:13:46.817 --> 00:13:53.387
but the actual number almost didn’t matter - the point was that if the UK could take back

00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:59.997
control of its finances then the quality of its treasured health service would improve.

00:14:00.667 --> 00:14:06.707
The Leave campaign also very cleverly, and partially accurately, linked spending

00:14:06.727 --> 00:14:12.287
on the NHS to the rise of immigration from Europe, especially Eastern Europe.

00:14:12.927 --> 00:14:19.267
Millions of people had come to the UK from Europe putting increasing pressure on the NHS.

00:14:20.137 --> 00:14:28.107
If we can limit the levels of immigration and spend an extra 350 million pounds a week on the NHS,

00:14:28.407 --> 00:14:34.897
then the quality of care in the country will increase for British people, so the argument went.

00:14:35.647 --> 00:14:41.107
Ultimately, the messaging of the Leave campaign triumphed, it resonated with

00:14:41.107 --> 00:14:50.707
a majority of voters, and was enough to convince 17,410,742 people, 52% of

00:14:50.707 --> 00:14:56.457
the voters, to put a big tick in the “yes” box to leave the European Union.

00:14:57.407 --> 00:15:02.167
Ever since the day of the vote, on June 23rd 2016,

00:15:02.317 --> 00:15:06.267
commentators have been asking themselves the reasons why.

00:15:07.217 --> 00:15:12.667
We’ll explore the major ones shortly, but before we do that it’s important to

00:15:12.697 --> 00:15:18.767
understand how the vote tended to be split across regions and demographics.

00:15:19.637 --> 00:15:23.337
To state the obvious, these are generalisations, but are

00:15:23.367 --> 00:15:26.787
useful to give you an idea of some of the differences.

00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:33.507
If you voted to Remain you might well be a member of a university

00:15:33.507 --> 00:15:39.587
town – Oxford, Bristol, Cambridge or York, for example, or a multicultural city.

00:15:40.207 --> 00:15:46.057
London, with its highly educated and multicultural population, voted Remain.

00:15:46.984 --> 00:15:50.547
If you were Scottish you were highly likely to vote Remain.

00:15:50.997 --> 00:15:56.617
If you were young and well educated then the likelihood was that you would vote Remain.

00:15:57.377 --> 00:16:03.077
Indeed, as a general rule, the older you were the more likely you were to vote Leave,

00:16:03.257 --> 00:16:08.117
and the more education you had received, the more likely you were to vote Remain.

00:16:09.042 --> 00:16:14.307
Leavers, people who voted Leave, were initially characterised as

00:16:14.477 --> 00:16:19.457
being mainly so called “left behinds”– in other words people who had

00:16:19.457 --> 00:16:24.674
not benefited from rises in wealth or, more broadly, globalisation.

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:30.177
Often these people viewed immigrants as making it more likely that the

00:16:30.187 --> 00:16:35.537
indigenous Brits’ wages would be held back in real terms because of

00:16:35.537 --> 00:16:40.327
the large numbers of immigrants who were prepared to work for less.

00:16:41.097 --> 00:16:45.877
These people were most likely to have supported UKIP and to hold

00:16:45.987 --> 00:16:50.997
what many from the educated city-dwelling, metropolitan elite would

00:16:51.177 --> 00:16:56.337
regard as “politically incorrect” or socially unprogressive views.

00:16:57.257 --> 00:17:02.894
By contrast, surveys show that a large group of socially conservative older

00:17:02.894 --> 00:17:08.664
voters, alarmed at the pace of change in society, also voted for Brexit.

00:17:09.544 --> 00:17:15.264
Although they may have shared many of the views of UKIP supporters they, for

00:17:15.274 --> 00:17:20.794
fear of being thought racist and inappropriate, kept these views to themselves.

00:17:21.654 --> 00:17:26.894
These people were often most motivated and energised by the sovereignty

00:17:26.904 --> 00:17:32.384
issue – the sense that Britain‘s status as an independent nation with the

00:17:32.424 --> 00:17:38.154
capacity to make its own laws had been undermined by its membership of the EU.

00:17:39.324 --> 00:17:47.324
Combined with all this was an erosion of trust in the political class, and in so-called “experts”.

00:17:48.074 --> 00:17:52.304
In the lead up to the Brexit campaign, the Conservative politician

00:17:52.474 --> 00:17:56.974
Michel Gove, who was himself the epitome of the political class,

00:17:56.984 --> 00:18:01.036
said “ I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”.

00:18:02.276 --> 00:18:09.126
For many people who voted Brexit, they simply didn’t trust politicians to improve their lives.

00:18:09.716 --> 00:18:15.346
From the bailing out of the banks and bankers after the Financial Crisis through to

00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:21.076
the Expenses Scandal where it was revealed that politicians were using public money as

00:18:21.076 --> 00:18:27.286
their own pocket money, there was simply a huge reduction of trust in those in power.

00:18:28.346 --> 00:18:34.656
Politicians and bankers were people who lived far away, inevitably down in London, spending

00:18:34.656 --> 00:18:40.266
your money, making decisions about your country and not doing anything to improve your life.

00:18:40.756 --> 00:18:44.906
And if you thought British politicians were bad, wait until you

00:18:44.936 --> 00:18:49.146
hear about European MPs, members of the European parliament.

00:18:50.044 --> 00:18:56.396
Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP was himself a member of the European parliament, and

00:18:56.436 --> 00:19:02.756
he told stories about how out of touch and unnecessary bureaucrats in Brussels were.

00:19:03.686 --> 00:19:09.796
The picture he painted was of overpaid bureaucrats in Brussels deciding what

00:19:09.796 --> 00:19:14.486
shape a banana should be - and he knew, because he had been one of them!

00:19:15.396 --> 00:19:22.466
What’s more, these EU politicians had done nothing to stop the immigration crisis, so not only

00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:28.786
were they vastly overpaid but they were also not doing anything that was helpful to Europe.

00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:32.186
Let’s be rid of them, the Leave campaign said.

00:19:32.886 --> 00:19:38.926
A vote to Leave is a vote for taking back control, it’s a vote to free ourselves from

00:19:38.936 --> 00:19:46.143
Brussels, to manage our own lives, our own finances, our own borders, and our own destinies.

00:19:46.925 --> 00:19:54.326
It’s a powerful message, and one that was powerful enough for 52% of voters to agree with.

00:19:55.336 --> 00:20:00.106
Ultimately, the story of the Brexit vote is one of a vote against the

00:20:00.116 --> 00:20:04.936
status quo, against the norm, against the elites, against traditional

00:20:04.986 --> 00:20:10.366
politicians, against out of touch bureaucrats, and a vote for change.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:15.246
Time will only tell the true impact of that change.

00:20:17.626 --> 00:20:22.436
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on the Brexit vote.

00:20:23.206 --> 00:20:27.856
As a reminder, this was part two of our three-part series on Brexit.

00:20:28.566 --> 00:20:33.196
In part one we talked about the relationship between Britain and Europe throughout

00:20:33.196 --> 00:20:38.176
history, and in part three we’ll talk about what has happened since the Brexit vote,

00:20:38.406 --> 00:20:43.676
and some of the theories about what a Brexit Britain might look like in the future.

00:20:44.506 --> 00:20:49.356
Those are both member-only episodes, and if you’d like to unlock those, as well

00:20:49.356 --> 00:20:55.686
as the subtitles, transcripts, and key vocabulary for our over 200 other episodes,

00:20:55.846 --> 00:21:00.406

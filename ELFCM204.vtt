Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.338
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:20.609
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:27.326
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our three part mini-series on Brexit.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.788
In Part One, which was one of our member-only episodes, we covered

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:36.358
the history of Britain’s complicated relationship with Europe.

00:00:37.258 --> 00:00:43.108
In Part three, which will be another member-only one and is coming out next week, we’ll

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:49.208
talk about the aftermath of the Brexit vote, what has actually happened since and how

00:00:49.358 --> 00:00:55.319
has it compared to the predictions made by both those who were for and against Brexit.

00:00:55.779 --> 00:01:00.739
And in today’s episode, part two, we are going to cover the vote itself.

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:07.059
We’ll talk about the run up to the vote, why the UK held a referendum on EU membership

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:13.538
in the first place, the campaigns that were run both for and against, how people

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.589
voted, and for what reasons, and why it was that the Leave vote that proved victorious.

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:23.565
OK then, the Brexit vote.

00:01:24.155 --> 00:01:29.055
If you listened to the last episode, you will remember that Britain has had a

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:35.035
long, close, and complicated relationship with Europe for the past two millennia.

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:42.942
Britain had been part of the European Community, the predecessor to the EU, since 1973.

00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:49.155
Relations hadn’t always been smooth, but it was considered by at least

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:54.205
those in power in Britain to have been a relationship of mutual benefit.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:02:00.366
So when it was announced that the UK was to hold a referendum on EU

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:05.736
membership, it wasn’t considered by most people to be such a big deal.

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:11.136
Indeed, it wasn’t the first time that the UK had held a referendum

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:15.546
on membership of the European Union - there was a referendum on the

00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:23.576
European Community in 1975, and 67% of people in the UK voted to remain.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:31.976
Up until the more recent referendum vote was announced, which was only in 2015, a year

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:39.236
before the actual referendum, the EU was a relatively minor issue for most people in the UK.

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:48.256
So, how did the country go from here to being consumed and divided over EU membership?

00:02:48.846 --> 00:02:56.196
And how did almost every commentator and person in power, be that the British Prime

00:02:56.196 --> 00:03:03.906
Minister David Cameron or the then US President Barack Obama, get it so badly wrong?

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:11.866
Let’s start by talking about why the UK even held a Brexit referendum in the first place.

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:16.496
Throughout history, as we heard about in the previous episode,

00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:21.486
Britain had a slightly sceptical attitude towards Europe.

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:28.626
It enjoyed the benefits of closer ties with Europe, but was never completely European.

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:35.496
Many people in Britain were deeply sceptical about closer ties with Europe, as they believed

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:41.686
that this would require Britain to give up control, to lose control over its own destiny.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:52.212
Despite the UK joining the EEC, the precursor to the EU in 1973, and then Britons voting by a

00:03:52.222 --> 00:04:01.482
large margin to remain in the EEC in 1975, these Eurosceptic feelings never completely went away.

00:04:02.462 --> 00:04:08.300
For many years it was mainly a technical question among right-wing politicians,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.280
but in the early 21st century, and especially the decade before the Brexit

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.930
vote, these feelings crept closer and closer into the public sphere.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.620
There were an increasing number of anti-Europe political groups, the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.260
main populist one being the UK Independent Party or UKIP, for short.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.560
It was led by one of the most controversial and divisive politicians in the country – a populist,

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.820
anti-immigration and anti-EU campaigner and member of the European Parliament called Nigel Farage.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.420
Like him or loathe him, he drew the crowds, he was popular,

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.160
and seen as much more approachable than normal politicians.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:07.323
Farage would often be photographed in a pub with a pint of British beer, wearing British

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:14.493
barber jackets, smoking cigarettes, and behaving in a way that wasn’t typical for politicians.

00:05:15.463 --> 00:05:18.673
This approach was hugely successful.

00:05:19.183 --> 00:05:21.023
UKIP continued to grow.

00:05:21.693 --> 00:05:29.303
In 2009 it received 16.5% of the votes in the European Parliament Elections, then it

00:05:29.303 --> 00:05:38.081
received 3.9 million votes, which was a 12.6% share in the UK 2015 General election,

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:44.611
and it was clear that its message was appealing to a certain part of the UK population.

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:52.364
After David Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010, he thought he could kill two

00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:58.164
birds with one stone by offering a referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU.

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:05.664
Firstly, it would placate the Eurosceptic element of his own party, the

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:11.014
Conservative party, and strengthen Cameron’s position as leader of the party.

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:17.774
It would also attract more right-wing voters who would otherwise vote for UKIP.

00:06:18.974 --> 00:06:24.224
Plus, for most people, or so Cameron thought, EU membership

00:06:24.264 --> 00:06:29.144
is an unimportant, simply bureaucratic part of their lives.

00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:35.544
Surveys done the years before the Brexit vote was announced suggested that

00:06:35.574 --> 00:06:41.494
only 1% of people in Britain actually thought EU membership was an important

00:06:41.504 --> 00:06:46.604
factor, and the last time the government had asked the British people for their

00:06:46.604 --> 00:06:53.574
views on Europe in the 1975 referendum, 67% had said they wanted to remain.

00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:59.434
What’s more, the British people had voted with the government on every

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:05.374
single referendum vote, and David Cameron had recently won the 2010 general

00:07:05.374 --> 00:07:11.114
election and the referendum on Scottish independence had also gone his way.

00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:18.004
So, when the Conservatives were up for re-election in 2015, Cameron

00:07:18.094 --> 00:07:22.964
decided to make a referendum on EU membership part of his manifesto.

00:07:23.674 --> 00:07:27.614
Vote Conservative, he said, and we will hold a referendum.

00:07:28.454 --> 00:07:33.794
It was a gamble, but one he seemed confident would go his way.

00:07:34.744 --> 00:07:38.224
It would end up costing him his political career, and

00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:42.754
be described as "indescribably selfish recklessness."

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:46.981
Now, let’s move on to the vote itself.

00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:54.951
After pledging to hold a referendum on EU membership, the stage was set for an electoral campaign.

00:07:55.831 --> 00:08:01.581
But the campaign on EU membership was unlike any normal political campaign.

00:08:02.551 --> 00:08:07.511
For starters, the campaigns weren’t divided along party lines.

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:15.121
Because he was confident that Remain would win and therefore his position would be strengthened,

00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:22.481
Cameron allowed Conservative MPs to decide for themselves whether to support Brexit or not.

00:08:23.388 --> 00:08:30.231
Many chose to go against Cameron, joining the Leave campaign, the campaign to exit the EU.

00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:36.361
They were also joined by politicians from Labour, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP.

00:08:37.511 --> 00:08:41.861
And the Remain campaign also had people from across the

00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:47.031
political spectrum, many of whom were there somewhat reluctantly.

00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:54.351
Not least the leader of the Conservatives, David Cameron, and the leader of Labour, Jeremy Corbyn.

00:08:54.951 --> 00:09:01.591
Both had expressed Eurosceptic views in the past, and both were fierce political

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:07.511
enemies and clearly disliked each other, so it was not particularly convincing.

00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:14.631
For someone like Jeremy Corbyn, who also thought that the Remain campaign was likely to

00:09:14.631 --> 00:09:22.651
win, there was little value in forming an alliance with his mortal enemy, David Cameron - he

00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:27.941
might have wanted Remain to win, but he didn’t want to make David Cameron look good.

00:09:29.181 --> 00:09:36.281
And when it came to the main messaging of the Remain camp, they didn’t tend to mention any of

00:09:36.281 --> 00:09:44.221
the benefits of EU membership, but instead focussed on the unnecessary risks of leaving the EU.

00:09:45.191 --> 00:09:49.891
Leaving the EU would be a jump into the darkness, leaping into

00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:54.511
the unknown, and a choice that would make everyone poorer.

00:09:55.691 --> 00:10:02.801
Bankers, economists and politicians did projections of what the cost of leaving the EU would be.

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:09.701
The UK Treasury, essentially the Ministry of Finance, even provided a real number

00:10:09.701 --> 00:10:15.071
of what Brexit would cost the average household in the UK every single year.

00:10:16.026 --> 00:10:21.076
£4,300, which was around €6,000 at the time.

00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:29.326
The overall message was, “yes, the EU might not be perfect, but it’s not so bad, and

00:10:29.496 --> 00:10:35.406
voting to leave means risking everything and you’ll probably end up a lot poorer”.

00:10:36.636 --> 00:10:41.526
It’s easy to say this with the benefit of hindsight, but this message

00:10:41.686 --> 00:10:46.536
simply wasn’t sufficiently convincing to much of the UK population.

00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:53.446
The Leave campaign, on the other hand, was significantly better organised, and

00:10:53.576 --> 00:10:58.676
had a much better understanding of what people actually wanted and cared about.

00:10:59.396 --> 00:11:03.666
Instead of trying to scare people into a decision, its

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:08.161
key messages were a mixture of emotional and practical.

00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:13.531
And ultimately, it all came down to a simple word: control.

00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:18.931
At almost any time anyone from the Leave campaign was talking about

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:24.891
Brexit, everything revolved around the idea of taking back control.

00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:28.011
Taking back control of British borders.

00:11:28.161 --> 00:11:31.371
Taking back control of decisions within the government.

00:11:31.661 --> 00:11:35.181
Taking back control of where British taxes are spent.

00:11:36.621 --> 00:11:42.541
They didn’t really compete on the argument of whether or not Brexit would make the UK poorer,

00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:50.821
instead putting all the focus on self-sovereignty and almost suggesting or at least admitting

00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:57.511
that it was better to be independent and a little bit poorer than controlled by Europe.

00:11:58.431 --> 00:12:04.591
The Leave campaign knew that this idea of self-control was very important to British

00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:10.381
voters, and used it effectively, especially when combined with something else that

00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:18.280
British people have an almost unbreakable love for: The National Health Service, the NHS.

00:12:19.191 --> 00:12:25.031
The Leave campaign made spending on the NHS a vital part of its campaign,

00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:31.891
even painting a bus with the message that the UK sends £350 million a

00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:37.261
week to the EU, and that we can spend that money on the NHS instead.

00:12:38.101 --> 00:12:45.041
Now, that number was proved to be incorrect, it was a great exaggeration of the real amount,

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:52.001
but the actual number almost didn’t matter - the point was that if the UK could take back

00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:58.611
control of its finances then the quality of its treasured health service would improve.

00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:05.321
The Leave campaign also very cleverly, and partially accurately, linked spending

00:13:05.341 --> 00:13:10.901
on the NHS to the rise of immigration from Europe, especially Eastern Europe.

00:13:11.541 --> 00:13:17.881
Millions of people had come to the UK from Europe putting increasing pressure on the NHS.

00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:26.721
If we can limit the levels of immigration and spend an extra 350 million pounds a week on the NHS,

00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:33.511
then the quality of care in the country will increase for British people, so the argument went.

00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:39.721
Ultimately, the messaging of the Leave campaign triumphed, it resonated with

00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:49.321
a majority of voters, and was enough to convince 17,410,742 people, 52% of

00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:55.071
the voters, to put a big tick in the “yes” box to leave the European Union.

00:13:56.021 --> 00:14:00.781
Ever since the day of the vote, on June 23rd 2016,

00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:04.881
commentators have been asking themselves the reasons why.

00:14:05.831 --> 00:14:11.281
We’ll explore the major ones shortly, but before we do that it’s important to

00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:17.381
understand how the vote tended to be split across regions and demographics.

00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:21.951
To state the obvious, these are generalisations, but are

00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:25.401
useful to give you an idea of some of the differences.

00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:32.121
If you voted to Remain you might well be a member of a university

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:38.201
town – Oxford, Bristol, Cambridge or York, for example, or a multicultural city.

00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:44.671
London, with its highly educated and multicultural population, voted Remain.

00:14:45.598 --> 00:14:49.161
If you were Scottish you were highly likely to vote Remain.

00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:55.231
If you were young and well educated then the likelihood was that you would vote Remain.

00:14:55.991 --> 00:15:01.691
Indeed, as a general rule, the older you were the more likely you were to vote Leave,

00:15:01.871 --> 00:15:06.731
and the more education you had received, the more likely you were to vote Remain.

00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:12.921
Leavers, people who voted Leave, were initially characterised as

00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:18.071
being mainly so called “left behinds”– in other words people who had

00:15:18.071 --> 00:15:23.288
not benefited from rises in wealth or, more broadly, globalisation.

00:15:24.181 --> 00:15:28.791
Often these people viewed immigrants as making it more likely that the

00:15:28.801 --> 00:15:34.151
indigenous Brits’ wages would be held back in real terms because of

00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:38.941
the large numbers of immigrants who were prepared to work for less.

00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:44.491
These people were most likely to have supported UKIP and to hold

00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:49.611
what many from the educated city-dwelling, metropolitan elite would

00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:54.951
regard as “politically incorrect” or socially unprogressive views.

00:15:55.871 --> 00:16:01.508
By contrast, surveys show that a large group of socially conservative older

00:16:01.508 --> 00:16:07.278
voters, alarmed at the pace of change in society, also voted for Brexit.

00:16:08.158 --> 00:16:13.878
Although they may have shared many of the views of UKIP supporters they, for

00:16:13.888 --> 00:16:19.408
fear of being thought racist and inappropriate, kept these views to themselves.

00:16:20.268 --> 00:16:25.508
These people were often most motivated and energised by the sovereignty

00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:30.998
issue – the sense that Britain‘s status as an independent nation with the

00:16:31.038 --> 00:16:36.768
capacity to make its own laws had been undermined by its membership of the EU.

00:16:37.938 --> 00:16:45.938
Combined with all this was an erosion of trust in the political class, and in so-called “experts”.

00:16:46.688 --> 00:16:50.918
In the lead up to the Brexit campaign, the Conservative politician

00:16:51.088 --> 00:16:55.588
Michel Gove, who was himself the epitome of the political class,

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:59.650
said “ I think the people of this country have had enough of experts”.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:07.740
For many people who voted Brexit, they simply didn’t trust politicians to improve their lives.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:13.960
From the bailing out of the banks and bankers after the Financial Crisis through to

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.690
the Expenses Scandal where it was revealed that politicians were using public money as

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:25.900
their own pocket money, there was simply a huge reduction of trust in those in power.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:33.270
Politicians and bankers were people who lived far away, inevitably down in London, spending

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:38.880
your money, making decisions about your country and not doing anything to improve your life.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.520
And if you thought British politicians were bad, wait until you

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:47.760
hear about European MPs, members of the European parliament.

00:17:48.658 --> 00:17:55.010
Nigel Farage, the leader of UKIP was himself a member of the European parliament, and

00:17:55.050 --> 00:18:01.370
he told stories about how out of touch and unnecessary bureaucrats in Brussels were.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:08.410
The picture he painted was of overpaid bureaucrats in Brussels deciding what

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.100
shape a banana should be - and he knew, because he had been one of them!

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:21.080
What’s more, these EU politicians had done nothing to stop the immigration crisis, so not only

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:27.400
were they vastly overpaid but they were also not doing anything that was helpful to Europe.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.800
Let’s be rid of them, the Leave campaign said.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:37.540
A vote to Leave is a vote for taking back control, it’s a vote to free ourselves from

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:44.757
Brussels, to manage our own lives, our own finances, our own borders, and our own destinies.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:52.940
It’s a powerful message, and one that was powerful enough for 52% of voters to agree with.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:58.720
Ultimately, the story of the Brexit vote is one of a vote against the

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:03.550
status quo, against the norm, against the elites, against traditional

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:08.980
politicians, against out of touch bureaucrats, and a vote for change.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.860
Time will only tell the true impact of that change.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.050
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on the Brexit vote.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:26.470
As a reminder, this was part two of our three-part series on Brexit.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.810
In part one we talked about the relationship between Britain and Europe throughout

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:36.790
history, and in part three we’ll talk about what has happened since the Brexit vote,

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.290
and some of the theories about what a Brexit Britain might look like in the future.

00:19:43.816 --> 00:19:48.516
You’ve been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

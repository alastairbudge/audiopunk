Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:11.375
English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:14.535
The show where you can learn fascinating things about

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.255
the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:25.925
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the British Royal family.

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:29.863
I'm sure you probably know a bit about them.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:35.473
You'd recognise the queen and you probably know what I mean by Buckingham Palace.

00:00:36.883 --> 00:00:40.363
Well, today we are going to go a little bit deeper.

00:00:41.223 --> 00:00:47.343
We are going to ask ourselves how the UK has managed to keep its monarchy while several

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:53.283
other European countries decided to get rid of theirs, some in spectacular fashion.

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:59.223
And we'll ask ourselves what they actually do and what the

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:03.483
future might hold for one of the world's most famous families.

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:06.693
So it is quite an exciting one.

00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:11.813
Before we get right into that though, just in case you

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:16.297
hadn't listened to the last episode, I just wanted to remind

00:01:16.297 --> 00:01:20.617
you that we have made some small changes to the way the podcast works.

00:01:21.307 --> 00:01:24.967
Firstly, we've split the membership into two different groups.

00:01:25.477 --> 00:01:29.197
Listener, if you just want to listen to all of the podcasts and

00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:32.437
Learner, if you also want the transcripts and key vocabulary.

00:01:33.277 --> 00:01:39.247
But more excitingly, there are two new developments that I would love for you to use.

00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:46.537
Firstly, anyone who is a member of Leonardo English, and if you're listening to this episode,

00:01:46.657 --> 00:01:53.377
then that's you, anyone who is a member of Leonardo English can now suggest topics for episodes.

00:01:54.277 --> 00:02:00.427
The team has a big list of exciting subjects that we want to cover, but I also

00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:06.097
want to include you in this, so if you want to hear more about a particular

00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:10.867
subject, then assuming that they are things that we think will be

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:15.457
interesting to other listeners, then we will actually make a podcast about them.

00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:17.827
So try that out.

00:02:17.977 --> 00:02:22.987
Head into your dashboard at leonardoenglish.com and start making those requests.

00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:28.177
And secondly, this is something that I'm super excited about.

00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:34.082
We are going to start doing monthly live Q&A, question and answer, sessions.

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:42.482
The idea for this is that they will be small, intimate groups, no more than 12 people to start with.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:48.572
We'll choose a topic to discuss, likely related to the podcast topics from that month,

00:02:49.142 --> 00:02:56.432
and it'll be an opportunity to talk, ask questions, and of course, practice your English.

00:02:57.422 --> 00:03:00.887
So keep your eyes peeled, keep a lookout, for an

00:03:00.887 --> 00:03:03.857
invite for the first one of those later on this month.

00:03:06.357 --> 00:03:09.327
Okay then let's talk about The Royal Family.

00:03:10.747 --> 00:03:15.517
The focus of today's episode is going to be on the current

00:03:15.547 --> 00:03:19.867
Royal family, the current queen and her extended family.

00:03:21.187 --> 00:03:28.042
But to do this it is of course useful to have a bit of background and to understand

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:35.272
a bit about the history of the British monarchy, the kings and queens that had ruled

00:03:35.272 --> 00:03:41.422
Great Britain, or at least parts of what we now call Great Britain over the years.

00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:47.611
There have been kings and queens in Britain for over a thousand years now.

00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:53.911
While some people claim that the monarchy only really started with the

00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:58.531
arrival of William the Conqueror in 1066 there were

00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:04.261
some kings and queens before then, even as early as the ninth century.

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:11.551
And although you might have thought that Britain had never got rid of its

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:16.771
monarchy, that we were so passionate about our kings and queens that we had

00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:22.591
never thought of revolution and chopping off their heads, that isn't quite right.

00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:27.901
In fact, England did get rid of its monarchy even

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:32.971
before our friends across the channel, the French, even before they did.

00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:41.131
There was a brief period called the Commonwealth of England, which started after King Charles

00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:51.331
the First was executed in 1649, but it only lasted 11 years when the monarchy was restored.

00:04:53.202 --> 00:04:59.082
So the brief flirtation with republicanism only lasted 11

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:06.552
years and England and then Great Britain has had a king or queen ever since.

00:05:08.426 --> 00:05:12.876
And today's monarch is, as you will know, Queen Elizabeth.

00:05:14.136 --> 00:05:20.136
She has been queen since 1952, 58 years ago, making her

00:05:20.136 --> 00:05:23.616
one of the longest serving monarchs in British history.

00:05:24.786 --> 00:05:29.136
She only needs to keep going for another five years, and she

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:34.986
will beat Queen Victoria who reigned for a massive 65 years.

00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:39.151
But something you might not know is

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:42.661
that Queen Elizabeth was never meant to be queen.

00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:46.501
She was never directly in line to the throne.

00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:54.931
Her uncle Edward the Eighth, her father's oldest brother, he was destined to be King,

00:05:55.561 --> 00:06:02.761
but after he couldn't marry the woman he wanted to marry, he abdicated, he gave away the

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:10.396
throne and it passed to his younger brother George the Sixth, Queen Elizabeth's father.

00:06:11.755 --> 00:06:15.539
And when he died, the throne went to Elizabeth.

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:21.139
So this queen was never meant to be queen, but she has

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:28.819
done the job for 58 years, much longer than most people do any normal job.

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:37.839
And I do use the term 'job' here because even though some people might think that being

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:46.009
queen just means sitting around all day drinking tea and not doing very much at all, the

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:52.819
queen does actually have quite lot to do, as do the members of her family, The Royal Family.

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:03.199
The Royal Family have between them about 2000 engagements that they carry out every year.

00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:09.341
These engagements might be opening hospitals, schools,

00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:15.257
sporting events, meeting world leaders, charity work, of

00:07:15.257 --> 00:07:22.067
course, typically ceremonial things, but they do do a large amount of it.

00:07:23.427 --> 00:07:28.107
The queen who recently celebrated her 94th birthday

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:35.427
had 292 engagements in 2019 that's almost six a week.

00:07:36.687 --> 00:07:44.882
That's a lot of meeting and greeting, a lot of small talk and shaking hands and certainly a lot of

00:07:44.882 --> 00:07:51.992
work for someone who, if they were doing a normal job, would probably have retired 30 years ago.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:58.044
And she isn't even the hardest working Royal in terms of duties.

00:07:58.764 --> 00:08:03.324
Her son, Prince Charles, did 550 official

00:08:03.324 --> 00:08:10.194
engagements in 2019 and her daughter, Anne, did just under 500.

00:08:12.014 --> 00:08:19.064
And they also are, as we say, no spring chicken, they aren't that young themselves.

00:08:19.784 --> 00:08:23.054
Charles is 71 and Anne is 69.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:31.914
So The Royal Family actually does quite a lot, a lot more than most people think that they do.

00:08:34.874 --> 00:08:39.404
And in terms of popular opinion of The Royal Family, of what people

00:08:39.404 --> 00:08:44.534
think of them, overall the British public approves of the monarchy.

00:08:45.044 --> 00:08:50.564
And the older you are, the more likely you are to approve of the monarchy.

00:08:51.584 --> 00:09:00.699
From a survey in 2018, 57% of people in the 18 to 24 age group said that they

00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:08.859
approved of the monarchy, but 77% of those in the 55 plus age group approved.

00:09:11.049 --> 00:09:14.337
And while, even in the age group with the lowest

00:09:14.337 --> 00:09:21.657
approval rating, the 18 to 24 age group, only 25% of them said that they

00:09:21.657 --> 00:09:26.612
disapproved, the rest said that they didn't feel strongly either way.

00:09:27.812 --> 00:09:30.542
So only a small percentage of the

00:09:30.542 --> 00:09:34.712
UK population actually disapproves of the monarchy.

00:09:35.702 --> 00:09:41.612
And it's worth spending a bit of time talking about why this actually is, why it

00:09:41.612 --> 00:09:47.882
might be lower than some people in more republican countries might think it would be.

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:53.504
Firstly, the current Royal family knows that it has a

00:09:53.504 --> 00:09:59.834
certain role to play in public life, a certain place in British society.

00:10:01.494 --> 00:10:09.534
And that is to be rolled out, to be brought out for ceremonial occasions and to provide

00:10:09.534 --> 00:10:15.909
a sense of collective spirit for the people, to provide a sense of nationalistic

00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:22.959
unity, and to provide a sense of continuity and united history of the country.

00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:27.669
But in almost every other respect, to be

00:10:27.669 --> 00:10:32.649
completely neutral, to not express an opinion on anything.

00:10:33.489 --> 00:10:37.239
The queen, despite being technically the head of state

00:10:37.509 --> 00:10:42.699
and having the power to appoint and dismiss a prime minister, she never

00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:49.059
expresses any public opinion about anything really, political or otherwise.

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:58.324
Indeed, after the Brexit vote in 2016, there was a lot of speculation that she

00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:06.064
actually disagreed with the way that the vote had gone because of some of the clothes that she wore.

00:11:07.324 --> 00:11:12.934
She never said anything, but she once wore a blue hat with yellow

00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:18.254
stars that did look quite a lot like the flag of the European Union.

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:26.054
And it was thought that she was wearing this as a mini protest against the Brexit vote.

00:11:27.794 --> 00:11:36.824
And then when the queen met Donald and Melania Trump in 2018 she wore a brooch, a piece

00:11:36.824 --> 00:11:44.999
of jewelry, given to her by Michelle Obama, which was interpreted by the British press

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:52.349
as being the Queen's secret way of saying that she didn't approve of Donald Trump.

00:11:53.969 --> 00:11:59.849
But this is all suspicion, the British public really doesn't know very

00:11:59.849 --> 00:12:05.939
much about the real queen, about what she actually thinks about anything.

00:12:07.378 --> 00:12:11.548
And this, is on one level, a pretty strange situation.

00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:16.798
There is this lady who has been in the public eye since

00:12:16.798 --> 00:12:21.448
she was born and has been queen for almost 60 years.

00:12:22.438 --> 00:12:25.978
She is one of the most recognisable brands in the world

00:12:26.518 --> 00:12:29.818
and has one of the most recognisable faces in the world.

00:12:30.853 --> 00:12:35.173
Of course her face is on every British banknote and every coin.

00:12:36.133 --> 00:12:39.703
I'm sure now that if you've closed your eyes and pictured the

00:12:39.703 --> 00:12:43.303
queen, you would have a pretty good idea of what she looks like.

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:51.403
Yet she has remained unknowable, silent on almost every issue,

00:12:52.003 --> 00:12:56.653
and she rarely has any kind of real dialogue with the public.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:03.189
There is something called the Queen's speech, where on Christmas day,

00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:09.789
just after lunch, the queen will address the people in a televised message, normally

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:16.629
just wishing everyone well and talking about some of the main events of the past year,

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:24.939
but not really saying very much at all, and certainly not expressing much of an opinion.

00:13:27.064 --> 00:13:30.982
So this is a pretty strange situation, certainly

00:13:30.982 --> 00:13:36.232
one that friends and family from republican countries, places like

00:13:36.262 --> 00:13:40.942
France and Italy, something that they really struggle to understand.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:47.762
For countries that have got rid of their own monarchies, got rid of their

00:13:47.762 --> 00:13:54.057
own kings and queens, it can be quite strange to think that one of the largest countries

00:13:54.057 --> 00:14:00.597
in Europe and certainly still an important power in global politics, has this royal

00:14:00.597 --> 00:14:08.277
family that the public overall approves of but doesn't really seem to know anything about.

00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:12.687
And they say, why do you keep them?

00:14:13.137 --> 00:14:17.487
Why aren't people rising up in the streets saying, get rid of them?

00:14:18.927 --> 00:14:24.357
There is of course, a proportion of the UK public that does want

00:14:24.387 --> 00:14:28.407
to abolish the monarchy, to get rid of the British Royal family.

00:14:30.052 --> 00:14:36.291
And there are a few reasons why they want to do it, some more valid than others.

00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:44.051
Let's first take one that is often quoted, and that is from a cost point of view.

00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:50.741
In a country where there are people who are homeless, where hospitals

00:14:50.741 --> 00:14:55.871
are overcrowded and schools need investment, why does the British

00:14:55.901 --> 00:15:02.301
taxpayer tolerate spending money on the maintenance of The Royal Family.

00:15:04.421 --> 00:15:08.561
It is a sensible question, but even from a cost point of

00:15:08.561 --> 00:15:14.471
view, the cost of the monarchy is still slightly debated.

00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:22.531
A recent study by The Daily Telegraph, which I should point out, is very much

00:15:22.531 --> 00:15:27.121
a pro-monarchy newspaper, suggested that The Royal Family

00:15:27.451 --> 00:15:35.341
costs each adult in Britain only 62p per year, so under a dollar per year.

00:15:36.961 --> 00:15:42.661
But republicans dispute this figure saying that when you factor in, when

00:15:42.661 --> 00:15:48.571
you consider, things like security, it's about three or four times more.

00:15:49.501 --> 00:15:53.791
Still not a huge amount of money, in the grand scheme of things.

00:15:55.651 --> 00:15:59.071
However, the cost isn't really the main issue.

00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:07.691
It is the idea that having a monarchy is contradictory to what a modern state should stand for.

00:16:09.071 --> 00:16:12.371
By default, a monarchic system isn't fair.

00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:14.921
Not everyone can be king or queen.

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:19.781
You have to be born in a particular family at a particular time,

00:16:20.111 --> 00:16:25.126
and only then you might just become the next King or queen.

00:16:26.347 --> 00:16:28.138
So it's not based on merit.

00:16:28.348 --> 00:16:32.068
The oldest child of the last monarch becomes the next monarch,

00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:38.428
whether that person is a potential Nobel prize winner or well, not.

00:16:39.508 --> 00:16:42.298
They become king or queen and so be it.

00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:50.649
So there are, of course, some quite persuasive arguments for republicanism in the

00:16:50.649 --> 00:16:59.109
UK, but it is still an idea that is supported by a relatively small proportion of the population.

00:17:01.156 --> 00:17:07.906
But for how long republicanism will remain a minority view is uncertain.

00:17:09.106 --> 00:17:14.536
The Queen is almost a hundred years old now, and she can't rule forever.

00:17:15.526 --> 00:17:21.981
When she dies the next in line to the throne is Charles, and he is

00:17:21.981 --> 00:17:27.291
not nearly as popular as his mother, nor as his son, Prince William.

00:17:28.941 --> 00:17:34.851
And while Prince William is relatively popular now, as he is viewed as quite

00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:40.581
normal, at least by the standards of The Royal Family, if he has to wait to

00:17:40.581 --> 00:17:45.651
be king for as long as his father, well, he'll be waiting for quite some time.

00:17:46.161 --> 00:17:53.196
And tastes and fashions change, just because he might be popular now that is certainly

00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:58.536
no guarantee that he will still be popular if he becomes king in 30 years' time.

00:18:01.386 --> 00:18:06.216
What The Royal Family are very good at though, or at least they

00:18:06.216 --> 00:18:11.916
are now good at, is changing and knowing when they need to change.

00:18:13.566 --> 00:18:21.051
This particular Royal family, The Windsors, has had to be good at adapting, at changing.

00:18:22.486 --> 00:18:27.466
Starting from 1917 when they had to change the name of the Royal

00:18:27.466 --> 00:18:33.376
house from the German Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the British sounding

00:18:33.436 --> 00:18:40.006
Windsor, they have realised that they will only survive if they have the support

00:18:40.096 --> 00:18:46.706
of the British public, that the goodwill of the public is the most important thing.

00:18:47.366 --> 00:18:52.466
And as soon as they lose this, the monarchy will be gone forever.

00:18:54.376 --> 00:19:00.166
So it is understandably a concern for the British Royal family and

00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:04.816
that they are doing everything they can to remain viewed positively.

00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:13.251
But interestingly enough, the main strategy for remaining popular is basically by

00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:21.081
being completely bland, by not really putting a foot out of line or showing any kind of personality.

00:19:22.256 --> 00:19:27.086
The strategy for remaining popular is by being present,

00:19:27.476 --> 00:19:32.846
by continuing the same traditions of things like opening buildings,

00:19:32.876 --> 00:19:38.096
charity work, that Christmas day speech and other ceremonial things.

00:19:39.266 --> 00:19:46.886
The role that The Royal Family plays is, on one level, just to exist, to

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:53.066
be constantly there and to provide a sense of stability for the country.

00:19:55.076 --> 00:20:00.266
The queen, of course, has a pretty impressive track record at doing this.

00:20:01.536 --> 00:20:07.686
She has had 14 British prime ministers and has met 12 US presidents.

00:20:09.086 --> 00:20:14.936
And of course the country has changed hugely during her time on the throne

00:20:15.656 --> 00:20:22.226
while she as an individual, hasn't really changed very much at all, or at

00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:28.166
least it's hard to know because the British public doesn't know the real queen.

00:20:29.606 --> 00:20:38.036
She and her family exist in the background performing this strange ceremonial role.

00:20:39.606 --> 00:20:42.906
Always there, but quite unknowable.

00:20:44.616 --> 00:20:51.551
British history, and also the history of other European monarchies has taught this royal

00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:59.231
family that the further it goes from this position, the further it sticks its neck out and

00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:06.791
shows any sort of real character or individuality, the more dangerous things become for it.

00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:11.831
They only need to look at Marie Antoinette or the Russian

00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:15.731
tsars to see what happens when a Royal family is too

00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:20.891
out of touch with the people and expresses too much of a personality.

00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:26.981
That's one of the theories about why The Royal Family has been

00:21:27.101 --> 00:21:32.231
particularly difficult with any new members that have brought any kind

00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:37.091
of personality, different views, or come from different backgrounds.

00:21:38.181 --> 00:21:45.051
Whether that's Princess Diana or Meghan Markle, any new views or differences,

00:21:45.291 --> 00:21:50.721
anything that draws too much attention is not seen as a good thing.

00:21:52.041 --> 00:21:58.761
The survival tactic seems to be to blend into the background, to do the official

00:21:58.761 --> 00:22:05.616
duties, to open schools, be patrons of charities, give Christmas messages, and just

00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:12.606
generally be there, exist while not doing anything that might offend anyone at all.

00:22:14.556 --> 00:22:19.166
So what this means is that, while everyone in Britain

00:22:19.226 --> 00:22:25.706
knows of The Royal Family, no one in Britain really knows The Royal Family.

00:22:27.776 --> 00:22:32.336
Okay, that is it for this little look at the British Royal family.

00:22:33.296 --> 00:22:38.156
As a Brit myself, it is on one level completely mad

00:22:38.186 --> 00:22:43.286
that we have a head of state who is an unelected woman in her nineties.

00:22:44.396 --> 00:22:48.596
But on another level it makes complete sense and it

00:22:48.596 --> 00:22:52.586
would be unthinkable to imagine Britain any other way.

00:22:54.446 --> 00:22:59.576
It certainly seems that The Royal Family isn't going anywhere anytime soon.

00:23:00.236 --> 00:23:05.966
They are quite adaptable, understand what is required of them, and it would take a big

00:23:05.996 --> 00:23:12.236
scandal and a big change in public opinion for any major disruption to happen here.

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:18.046
So if you are waiting for the day that you turn on the news in the morning

00:23:18.406 --> 00:23:23.056
to find that Brits have risen up and are marching on Buckingham Palace

00:23:23.086 --> 00:23:28.881
to turf out The Royal Family, I think you will have to wait quite some time for that.

00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:32.631

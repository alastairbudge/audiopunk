Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.430
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.470
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.280
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.709
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.740
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.780
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.840
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.250
two in our mini series on the Cambridge

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.839
Five: a spy ring that infiltrated the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.150
upper echelons of Britain’s political

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.850
and intelligence worlds and leaked

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.390
state secrets to the Soviet Union.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.180
On a quick practical note, if you

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.539
haven’t listened to part one yet,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.019
please do go back and do that, as

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.769
this episode leads straight on from

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.090
where we left the story last time.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.880
OK then, let’s get into it

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:50.980
and talk about the secrets and

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.059
spycraft of the Cambridge Five.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.649
In a central London pub, Guy

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.000
Burgess finished off his drink.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.270
The air was thick with the smell of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.330
cigarette smoke, sweat and frothy beer.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.920
Conversation rumbled on in the background,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.870
chair legs screeched on the wooden floor.

00:01:14.017 --> 00:01:17.137
As he so often was, Burgess was as

00:01:17.147 --> 00:01:19.697
drunk as a skunk, he was heavily

00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:21.127
under the influence of alcohol.

00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:24.917
But he wasn’t in the pub for social

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:26.967
reasons, he was there on business.

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:29.767
Spy business more specifically, and

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:32.057
he had just established contact with

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:34.577
one of his ‘handlers’ - a Soviet agent

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.817
managing him and the Cambridge Five.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.827
Putting down his glass, Burgess stood

00:01:40.827 --> 00:01:43.577
up and made his way to the door, swaying

00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:46.177
slightly from side to side, the alcohol

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:48.587
now well and truly gone to his head.

00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:52.657
But as he pushed the door open, he

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:55.357
dropped his briefcase and several stolen

00:01:55.357 --> 00:01:57.877
papers spiralled onto the pavement.

00:01:59.197 --> 00:02:01.027
He rushed around to pick them up,

00:02:01.197 --> 00:02:02.887
paranoid that someone would see.

00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:04.517
Would he be caught?

00:02:04.747 --> 00:02:06.387
Would the first of the Cambridge

00:02:06.387 --> 00:02:08.657
Five be outed as a double-agent?

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:10.887
Would the dominoes begin to tumble?

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:13.627
A policeman came over to him.

00:02:14.237 --> 00:02:16.357
Burgess’s spine began to tingle.

00:02:17.547 --> 00:02:20.057
But the policeman didn’t seem interested

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:22.187
in the dropped papers, or rather,

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:24.237
his main concern was helping Burgess

00:02:24.257 --> 00:02:26.017
to pick them up and put them back

00:02:26.117 --> 00:02:28.427
in his briefcase - documents that

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:30.617
Burgess had stolen from the British

00:02:30.627 --> 00:02:33.047
Foreign Office earlier that very day.

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:35.847
Thanking the policeman and snapping

00:02:35.847 --> 00:02:38.207
his briefcase firmly shut, Burgess

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:40.217
made his way down the street and

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:41.897
disappeared around the corner.

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:45.337
It was a close call - just

00:02:45.357 --> 00:02:47.537
another example of the sheer luck

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.127
that helped the Cambridge Five

00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:50.967
get away with it for so long.

00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:55.437
As I hope you remember from part one,

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:57.757
we left the story of the Cambridge Five

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:00.507
just as the Second World War had started.

00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:04.707
By then Philby, Burgess, Maclean,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.277
Cairncross and Blunt had passed

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.817
through Britain’s elite private

00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:11.169
schools onto Cambridge University, and

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.219
were establishing themselves in the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.209
upper echelons of the British state.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:18.709
Like many students in the political

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.459
turbulence of the 1930s, during their

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.239
time at Cambridge their political

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.749
views had moved far to the left.

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.199
Unlike most students, however,

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.389
these five men had been

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.659
recruited by Soviet intelligence.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.946
They were “The Cambridge Five”.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:39.289
As the Second World War began, the

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.349
Five were beginning to get established

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.429
in their careers, in their ‘covers’.

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.349
As a quick reminder, Burgess was in the

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.749
Foreign Office, as was Cairncross briefly.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.939
Philby was in MI6, Blunt in MI5,

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.409
and Maclean the diplomatic service.

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.319
Clearly, the Soviet’s plan of ‘turning’

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.479
high-flying British graduates before

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.009
they entered the ‘corridors of power’

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.519
was coming to fruition, that is,

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:08.589
it was really working rather well.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.249
So, what did they actually do as spies?

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.739
And how did it work?

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.039
Well, essentially, they used their

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.343
positions of power to pass vast

00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:21.723
amounts of confidential, classified

00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:24.573
information East, to the Soviet Union.

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:27.403
If we take the case of Kim Philby,

00:04:27.664 --> 00:04:29.812
who is perhaps the most famous of

00:04:29.812 --> 00:04:31.932
the Cambridge Five, he spent most

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:33.682
of his career working for British

00:04:33.702 --> 00:04:36.782
intelligence, working for the famous MI6.

00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:40.682
If this acronym MI6 rings any

00:04:40.682 --> 00:04:43.852
bells, yes MI6 is also the workplace

00:04:43.982 --> 00:04:46.362
of another famous British spy, a

00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:48.662
fictional spy I should add, James Bond.

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:51.112
And if you’re wondering what the

00:04:51.112 --> 00:04:55.032
difference between MI5 and MI6 is, MI5

00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:57.999
deals with internal, domestic, threats,

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.999
and MI6 deals with foreign threats.

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.889
Incredibly, Philby was so deeply embedded

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.713
in MI6 that he was even made head

00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:11.293
of the Soviet counterespionage unit.

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:15.133
That’s right: the Soviet spy was put in

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:18.123
charge of Soviet counterespionage, the

00:05:18.203 --> 00:05:21.423
very unit investigating Soviet spies.

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:26.043
As you might expect, this was a huge

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:28.303
win for the Soviets, it was pretty

00:05:28.303 --> 00:05:30.323
much the best possible result.

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:33.733
Thanks to Philby, the Soviets knew

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:35.693
most of the names of British agents

00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:38.243
operating in Europe in the 1950s and

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:40.693
they had a constant stream of information

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:42.393
on British intelligence gathering.

00:05:43.803 --> 00:05:46.283
But Philby wasn’t the only one on an

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.983
upward trajectory; Donald Maclean's career

00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:51.513
had also gone from strength to strength.

00:05:52.443 --> 00:05:54.273
He had become a successful diplomat

00:05:54.463 --> 00:05:56.423
in the Foreign Office, and enjoyed

00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:58.653
unlimited access to top secret

00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:01.033
military and nuclear information,

00:06:01.353 --> 00:06:03.293
which he leaked to his handlers.

00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:06.543
Guy Burgess had also enjoyed a

00:06:06.563 --> 00:06:08.970
successful career, working for MI6,

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:11.003
the BBC, and the Foreign Office.

00:06:11.693 --> 00:06:14.013
He rubbed shoulders with spies and

00:06:14.013 --> 00:06:16.443
politicians, and just like during his

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.373
time at Cambridge, he was incredibly

00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:21.423
social and seemingly knew everybody.

00:06:21.883 --> 00:06:24.043
He even mingled with the likes of Winston

00:06:24.073 --> 00:06:26.403
Churchill, who gave him a signed book.

00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:30.203
During the Second World War the quiet

00:06:30.393 --> 00:06:33.323
Anthony Blunt worked at MI5, the other

00:06:33.323 --> 00:06:35.313
arm of the British intelligence services,

00:06:35.523 --> 00:06:37.263
where he passed on information about

00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:39.533
German espionage activities in Britain.

00:06:40.653 --> 00:06:43.443
And John Cairncross, the final member

00:06:43.663 --> 00:06:45.913
and the only one of the five from a

00:06:45.923 --> 00:06:47.913
working class background, worked in

00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:49.833
the famous code-breaking facility

00:06:49.883 --> 00:06:51.963
at Bletchley Park, cracking German

00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:54.133
communication codes, stuffing papers

00:06:54.303 --> 00:06:56.343
into his trousers, and passing the

00:06:56.343 --> 00:06:58.333
information back to his handler.

00:06:59.283 --> 00:07:02.393
Now, though Philby, Maclean and Burgess

00:07:02.593 --> 00:07:04.943
are perhaps the most famous of the Five,

00:07:05.213 --> 00:07:07.403
or the most personally interesting, at

00:07:07.403 --> 00:07:09.823
least, during the war it was actually

00:07:09.913 --> 00:07:11.713
Cairncross who was doing the most

00:07:11.743 --> 00:07:14.313
effective espionage, that is, stealing

00:07:14.313 --> 00:07:16.453
the most valuable information, cracking

00:07:16.663 --> 00:07:18.693
German coded messages and passing

00:07:18.693 --> 00:07:20.893
the information back to the Soviets.

00:07:22.203 --> 00:07:24.573
He was even personally credited by the

00:07:24.573 --> 00:07:27.003
Soviets for playing a major role in its

00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:29.703
victory at the Battle of Kursk in 1943.

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:32.995
In terms of just how much

00:07:33.025 --> 00:07:34.645
information was being passed back,

00:07:34.945 --> 00:07:37.425
the numbers are quite astounding.

00:07:38.685 --> 00:07:40.935
The information included copies,

00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:43.705
photographs, codes and original

00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:47.915
secret documents, with 1,771 coming

00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:54.235
from Blunt, 4,605 from Burgess, 4,593

00:07:54.245 --> 00:07:57.895
from MacLean and almost 6,000 from

00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:01.195
Cairncross between 1941 and 1945.

00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:04.305
In fact, often the Cambridge Five’s

00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:07.855
information was so good, so plentiful,

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.965
that the Soviets were suspicious,

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:12.095
believing that the men’s seemingly

00:08:12.155 --> 00:08:14.015
unlimited access to British state

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:16.312
secrets was reason  not to trust them.

00:08:16.902 --> 00:08:19.192
It was simply too easy,

00:08:19.572 --> 00:08:20.932
something smelled fishy.

00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:23.632
Even Stalin feared it was too good

00:08:23.642 --> 00:08:25.872
to be true: that they were, in fact,

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:29.352
long-term double, or triple agents

00:08:29.562 --> 00:08:32.132
sent to infiltrate Soviet intelligence.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:35.002
They were particularly paranoid about

00:08:35.032 --> 00:08:37.332
Philby, thinking that his public

00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:39.362
communist sympathies as a young man

00:08:39.612 --> 00:08:41.302
would have made it unlikely that he

00:08:41.302 --> 00:08:43.572
would have become so senior in MI6.

00:08:44.242 --> 00:08:46.592
How could it be possible, they thought,

00:08:46.882 --> 00:08:49.202
that someone who had been so openly

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:51.482
communist in the past could become

00:08:51.482 --> 00:08:53.972
the head of anti-Soviet espionage?

00:08:54.762 --> 00:08:56.672
It didn’t seem to make any sense.

00:08:57.822 --> 00:09:00.582
But what they probably hadn’t appreciated

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:02.512
was the fact that the British class

00:09:02.522 --> 00:09:05.004
system made this possible; Philby

00:09:05.272 --> 00:09:07.372
came from a good family, had gone

00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:09.252
to the right schools, he could get

00:09:09.252 --> 00:09:11.072
away with practically anything.

00:09:12.602 --> 00:09:14.652
As the Second World War ended and

00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:17.492
the Cold War began, the nature of the

00:09:17.492 --> 00:09:19.622
Cambridge Five’s work began to change.

00:09:20.382 --> 00:09:22.722
With Nazi Germany and fascism

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:24.732
defeated, they were no longer

00:09:24.732 --> 00:09:27.502
spying for an ally but an enemy.

00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:31.092
This was, as you can imagine, an

00:09:31.132 --> 00:09:33.082
altogether different proposition.

00:09:34.002 --> 00:09:36.202
With Nazism defeated, the Cambridge

00:09:36.202 --> 00:09:38.342
Five could no longer justify their

00:09:38.342 --> 00:09:41.432
spying as part of a broader anti-fascist

00:09:41.432 --> 00:09:43.702
fight, but they were now spying

00:09:43.722 --> 00:09:45.752
directly against their homeland.

00:09:46.642 --> 00:09:49.322
And they became even more important,

00:09:49.432 --> 00:09:51.742
even more valuable, to the Soviets.

00:09:53.022 --> 00:09:55.192
As you will know, the Cold War was

00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:57.922
dominated by paranoia of nuclear war,

00:09:58.292 --> 00:10:00.722
and as they moved towards the 1950s,

00:10:00.942 --> 00:10:03.712
some of the Five began leaking secrets

00:10:03.992 --> 00:10:05.892
about Britain’s nuclear programme.

00:10:06.962 --> 00:10:09.532
Cairncross is considered by some to be the

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:12.842
first ‘atomic spy’, and while working at

00:10:12.842 --> 00:10:14.872
Britain's Scientific Advisory Committee

00:10:14.952 --> 00:10:17.292
he leaked incredibly sensitive information

00:10:17.552 --> 00:10:20.242
about Britain’s uranium bomb capabilities.

00:10:21.572 --> 00:10:23.722
It's even thought that the Soviets used

00:10:23.742 --> 00:10:26.272
information sent to them by Cairncross

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.432
to begin building their own atomic bomb.

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:33.242
Similarly, in 1944, Maclean had been

00:10:33.242 --> 00:10:35.072
posted to the British embassy in

00:10:35.072 --> 00:10:37.582
Washington D.C where he had access to

00:10:37.582 --> 00:10:40.492
both British and American nuclear secrets.

00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:43.462
As such, he became one of Moscow’s

00:10:43.592 --> 00:10:45.612
primary sources of information on

00:10:45.612 --> 00:10:47.362
the West’s nuclear development.

00:10:48.502 --> 00:10:50.222
Just think about that for a minute.

00:10:50.542 --> 00:10:53.062
Two British citizens, experts

00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:54.762
working on building up the West’s

00:10:54.792 --> 00:10:57.062
nuclear armoury, could be responsible

00:10:57.172 --> 00:10:58.712
for giving the Soviets their

00:10:58.782 --> 00:11:00.902
own bomb… during the Cold War.

00:11:02.052 --> 00:11:03.542
It almost goes without saying,

00:11:03.582 --> 00:11:06.032
but this was some serious stuff,

00:11:06.262 --> 00:11:08.162
some pretty impressive spywork.

00:11:09.606 --> 00:11:12.056
Now, the actual spywork of the Cambridge

00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:14.226
Five is very different to any kind of

00:11:14.226 --> 00:11:15.966
spywork you might be thinking about

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:18.546
from, let’s say, a James Bond movie.

00:11:19.216 --> 00:11:21.136
The spywork of these five men was

00:11:21.156 --> 00:11:23.626
all about information, about sharing

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:25.516
confidential, highly classified,

00:11:25.516 --> 00:11:26.836
information with the enemy.

00:11:28.238 --> 00:11:30.408
So, how did the men actually

00:11:30.418 --> 00:11:31.618
leak their information?

00:11:32.408 --> 00:11:34.048
Having bits of paper stuffed into

00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:35.898
your trousers is one thing, but

00:11:36.088 --> 00:11:37.868
how did they actually get that

00:11:37.878 --> 00:11:39.928
information to their Soviet handlers?

00:11:40.718 --> 00:11:42.998
Clearly, it was a risky procedure.

00:11:43.618 --> 00:11:45.998
Every time a document was handed over,

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:48.168
there was the possibility of being caught,

00:11:48.508 --> 00:11:50.488
with life-threatening consequences.

00:11:51.198 --> 00:11:54.028
Up until 1946, people were still

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:56.548
executed in Britain for treason, and

00:11:56.688 --> 00:11:59.848
in fact it wasn’t until 1998 that the

00:11:59.848 --> 00:12:02.068
death penalty was completely abolished.

00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:05.108
It was scary stuff, so how did

00:12:05.108 --> 00:12:06.718
they do it without being caught?

00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:10.748
The Cambridge Five, and indeed all

00:12:10.748 --> 00:12:13.118
spies whether British, American, or

00:12:13.158 --> 00:12:16.098
Soviet, mostly used a system known as

00:12:16.098 --> 00:12:18.248
a ‘dead drop’ to pass on information.

00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:21.472
A dead drop is essentially when a

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:23.852
spy leaves information - whether

00:12:24.012 --> 00:12:26.642
photos or documents or codes - in

00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:28.772
a public but hidden place, and

00:12:29.002 --> 00:12:30.892
their handler picks it up later.

00:12:32.012 --> 00:12:34.832
The idea was that the spy and handler

00:12:34.982 --> 00:12:37.092
would never be caught in the same place

00:12:37.182 --> 00:12:39.482
at the same time, though when it was

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:41.862
absolutely necessary to speak in person

00:12:42.242 --> 00:12:44.952
these meetups were often done in busy

00:12:45.062 --> 00:12:47.552
public places so they could blend, and

00:12:47.722 --> 00:12:49.852
disappear if necessary, into the crowd.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.930
Just like when Kim Philby was first

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.920
recruited in Regents Park back in 1934

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.390
and this whole story started, or when

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.710
Burgess dropped his briefcase in the pub.

00:13:02.455 --> 00:13:04.475
So, where did the Cambridge Five

00:13:04.475 --> 00:13:06.045
meet their handlers and where

00:13:06.045 --> 00:13:07.955
did they do these ‘dead drops’?

00:13:08.815 --> 00:13:11.155
Well, according to Philby’s own words

00:13:11.205 --> 00:13:13.565
in a written confession from January

00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:17.103
1963, “Our meetings always took place

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:18.751
in outlying districts of London…

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.361
and almost always in the open air.”

00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:24.351
“The regular drill consisted of

00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:26.441
synchronising watches with a neighbouring

00:13:26.441 --> 00:13:28.361
clock, appearing at the rendezvous

00:13:28.632 --> 00:13:31.021
on the dot, taking at least three

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:33.601
taxis both to and from the rendezvous

00:13:33.851 --> 00:13:35.081
to ensure that no one followed.

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:38.025
At each meeting a time and a

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.701
place was fixed for the next one.”

00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:42.831
We’ll hear more about that confession

00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:44.791
in part three, and it's worth

00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:46.741
noting, here, that we can’t take

00:13:46.761 --> 00:13:49.511
anything the Five say too literally.

00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:52.741
For all we know, Philby’s supposed

00:13:52.761 --> 00:13:55.361
‘confession’ could have been a ruse, a

00:13:55.471 --> 00:13:57.681
distraction, and should be taken with a

00:13:57.681 --> 00:13:59.911
‘pinch of salt’, not completely believed.

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.341
But this method of meeting in public

00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:06.491
places, being punctual and being careful

00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:08.641
not to be followed, certainly fits

00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:10.721
in with what we know of the Cambridge

00:14:10.721 --> 00:14:12.961
Five and spycraft more generally.

00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:15.841
They, of course, had to be incredibly

00:14:15.841 --> 00:14:18.441
careful not to be followed or caught out.

00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:21.651
Philby, especially, as he was heading

00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:24.141
the anti-Soviet division of MI6.

00:14:24.811 --> 00:14:27.121
If he was caught, it was possible

00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:29.211
that the entire Cambridge Five spy

00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:31.671
ring would fall apart because he had

00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:33.741
been the first to be recruited and

00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:35.471
had recommended some of the others.

00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:37.581
He could join the dots.

00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:41.331
But as time went on and the Five became

00:14:41.331 --> 00:14:43.661
more comfortable in their double-lives,

00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:46.141
being promoted and becoming firmly

00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:47.871
established in their careers, they

00:14:47.871 --> 00:14:49.621
were sure they’d never be caught.

00:14:50.751 --> 00:14:52.841
As you might imagine, this caused

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:55.441
several of them to become complacent,

00:14:55.631 --> 00:14:57.491
to not take as much care as they

00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.071
should to cover their tracks.

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.791
The Cambridge Five - in particular the

00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:05.611
now hopelessly alcoholic Burgess - became

00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:08.381
increasingly sloppy, careless over time.

00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:11.781
And pubs and alcohol more generally

00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:13.991
played a big role in the rise

00:15:14.011 --> 00:15:15.721
and fall of the Cambridge Five.

00:15:16.671 --> 00:15:18.231
All of the men were known

00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:19.401
to be heavy drinkers.

00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:21.671
Burgess in particular, who

00:15:21.671 --> 00:15:22.921
would have met any modern

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.711
definition of being an alcoholic.

00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:28.331
According to Philby, though he had

00:15:28.331 --> 00:15:30.941
recommended Maclean to Otto as a potential

00:15:30.941 --> 00:15:33.481
recruit he had actually warned against

00:15:33.511 --> 00:15:35.861
Guy Burgess because he was known to be

00:15:35.881 --> 00:15:38.801
a heavy drinker and incredibly sociable,

00:15:38.961 --> 00:15:40.781
even during his university days.

00:15:42.241 --> 00:15:44.001
Burgess was witty and charming,

00:15:44.221 --> 00:15:46.511
and known as a ‘man about town’,

00:15:46.681 --> 00:15:48.261
we might say, meaning someone

00:15:48.361 --> 00:15:50.121
sociable and well connected.

00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:53.121
Just as he had bragged during his time

00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:55.801
at university, Burgess, it seemed, knew

00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:58.541
everyone and mingled with high-society

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.321
figures like Winston Churchill’s

00:16:00.331 --> 00:16:02.561
niece, the famous economist John

00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:05.091
Maynard Keynes, respected writers and

00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:08.531
a whole host of MI5 and MI6 spies.

00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:11.121
Talk about hiding in plain sight.

00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:14.731
But there was another reason that

00:16:14.731 --> 00:16:16.951
Philby cautioned against Burgess, that

00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:19.091
he warned Otto not to recruit him.

00:16:19.991 --> 00:16:21.471
A secret that he shared

00:16:21.471 --> 00:16:22.511
with Blunt in fact.

00:16:23.341 --> 00:16:26.181
Both men were gay, they were homosexual,

00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:28.511
and there is even a theory that the

00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:30.138
pair had been lovers at one point.

00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:33.499
Homosexuality was still a crime in

00:16:33.499 --> 00:16:36.079
Britain in the 1930s, and Philby

00:16:36.079 --> 00:16:38.289
thought that someone could use their

00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:40.899
sexuality against them, using it to

00:16:41.129 --> 00:16:43.589
blackmail them and extort secrets.

00:16:45.029 --> 00:16:46.639
But when it comes to Burgess,

00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:49.129
his main problem wasn’t his

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:51.319
sexuality, it was his drinking.

00:16:52.439 --> 00:16:54.299
According to Soviet files released

00:16:54.449 --> 00:16:56.829
years later, Burgess was, and I'm

00:16:56.929 --> 00:16:59.349
quoting directly, "constantly under

00:16:59.369 --> 00:17:00.989
the influence of alcohol,” and

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:02.939
considered loud and theatrical.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.239
As one MI5 official put it in 1949,

00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:09.809
“Burgess appears to be a complete

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.029
alcoholic and I do not think that

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:14.349
even in Gibraltar I have ever seen

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:16.729
anyone put away so much hard liquor

00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:18.939
in so short a time as he did.”

00:17:20.129 --> 00:17:22.489
A loud drunk with a tendency to draw

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.829
attention to himself might not strike

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.369
you, or seem to be, the ideal spy.

00:17:28.719 --> 00:17:30.709
Yet it was actually Burgess’

00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:32.899
alcoholism and overly-confident

00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:35.079
demeanour that served as his cover.

00:17:36.059 --> 00:17:37.799
People looked at him and thought

00:17:38.289 --> 00:17:40.479
“a loud and overly confident drunk,

00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:42.579
surely he would make a terrible spy!”

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:45.069
How could a man, according to one

00:17:45.069 --> 00:17:48.049
biography known as a “smelly, scruffy,

00:17:48.209 --> 00:17:50.409
lying, promiscuous, drunken slob,”

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:52.989
position himself in the high-ranks of the

00:17:52.989 --> 00:17:55.125
Foreign Office while being a Soviet spy?

00:17:56.186 --> 00:17:58.386
Indeed, it was precisely this cover

00:17:58.676 --> 00:18:00.796
that made him, for so many years, an

00:18:00.796 --> 00:18:02.846
incredibly effective double-agent.

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:05.816
Hiding in plain sight, he

00:18:05.826 --> 00:18:08.279
delivered 168 documents to the

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:11.429
Soviets in December of 1949 alone.

00:18:13.197 --> 00:18:15.567
Maclean too, according to Soviet files,

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:18.097
was "constantly drunk," and known to

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.687
be "not very good at keeping secrets.”

00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:22.337
In fact, it's believed that several

00:18:22.357 --> 00:18:24.369
of the men - certainly Burgess and

00:18:24.369 --> 00:18:26.997
Maclean and likely Philby - actually

00:18:27.057 --> 00:18:28.937
confessed that they were working for

00:18:28.937 --> 00:18:30.497
the Soviets when they were drunk.

00:18:31.657 --> 00:18:33.307
Now, it’s worth spending a little

00:18:33.307 --> 00:18:35.537
more time talking about Blunt, the

00:18:35.727 --> 00:18:38.557
oldest of the five, as his career went

00:18:38.567 --> 00:18:40.247
in a slightly different direction.

00:18:41.237 --> 00:18:43.187
After his brief stints in the

00:18:43.187 --> 00:18:45.587
army and MI5 during the war, he

00:18:45.587 --> 00:18:47.787
explored other interests and he did

00:18:47.787 --> 00:18:49.847
far less spywork than the others.

00:18:50.727 --> 00:18:53.107
Instead, he had a career in academia

00:18:53.327 --> 00:18:55.717
and became a leading art historian with

00:18:55.877 --> 00:18:58.567
expertise in French art and architecture.

00:18:59.857 --> 00:19:02.167
In his memoir, he explained that

00:19:02.217 --> 00:19:04.347
after the war he just wanted a quiet

00:19:04.347 --> 00:19:07.407
life: " In fact I was disillusioned

00:19:07.407 --> 00:19:09.637
about Marxism as well as about Russia.

00:19:10.277 --> 00:19:12.477
What I personally hoped to do was to

00:19:12.477 --> 00:19:14.707
hear no more of my Russian friends,

00:19:14.967 --> 00:19:17.497
to return to my normal academic life.

00:19:18.217 --> 00:19:20.047
Of course it was not as simple as

00:19:20.047 --> 00:19:21.867
that, because there remained the

00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:23.487
fact that I knew of the continuing

00:19:23.487 --> 00:19:25.957
activities of Guy, Donald, and Kim."

00:19:27.387 --> 00:19:30.917
In 1945 he even became Surveyor of the

00:19:30.917 --> 00:19:33.427
King's, and later the Queen’s, Pictures,

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:35.467
which is considered one of the most

00:19:35.497 --> 00:19:37.837
prestigious jobs in the art world.

00:19:39.007 --> 00:19:40.727
This meant that he was in regular

00:19:40.727 --> 00:19:42.587
contact with the Royal Family, even

00:19:42.597 --> 00:19:44.737
staying and travelling with them, and

00:19:44.927 --> 00:19:47.337
advised the Queen on her personal art

00:19:47.367 --> 00:19:50.317
collection, all while being a Soviet spy.

00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:53.577
Like Philby leading the anti-Soviet

00:19:53.577 --> 00:19:56.157
programme, Blunt hid in plain sight:

00:19:56.607 --> 00:19:58.877
a double-agent camouflaging himself,

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:01.917
or hiding, in the palaces of royalty.

00:20:03.047 --> 00:20:05.668
But as the expression goes, all

00:20:05.688 --> 00:20:07.518
good things must come to an end.

00:20:08.368 --> 00:20:10.878
By the late-1940s the Cambridge Five had

00:20:10.878 --> 00:20:13.258
stolen such a huge amount of information

00:20:13.485 --> 00:20:15.293
that the intelligence communities on

00:20:15.303 --> 00:20:18.063
both sides of the Atlantic began to

00:20:18.063 --> 00:20:20.333
suspect that there was a mole, that

00:20:20.443 --> 00:20:22.783
there was someone leaking information.

00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:26.433
After years of being behind, both British

00:20:26.533 --> 00:20:28.713
and American intelligence were beginning

00:20:28.723 --> 00:20:30.843
to catch up to the Cambridge Five.

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.353
With the net tightening around

00:20:33.373 --> 00:20:35.943
them and many unravelling on a

00:20:35.983 --> 00:20:37.933
personal level, it all started to

00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:39.873
go wrong across the Atlantic, in

00:20:39.873 --> 00:20:41.458
the United States, where Philby and

00:20:41.459 --> 00:20:43.383
Burgess were working after the war.

00:20:44.563 --> 00:20:47.113
But would the two working in Washington

00:20:47.113 --> 00:20:49.173
D.C be able to warn their fellow

00:20:49.173 --> 00:20:51.093
spies back in Britain in time,

00:20:51.263 --> 00:20:52.823
before the authorities got to them?

00:20:53.393 --> 00:20:54.233
What would they do,

00:20:54.393 --> 00:20:55.773
once they were ‘busted’?

00:20:56.163 --> 00:20:58.183
And why did the responsibility for

00:20:58.223 --> 00:21:00.863
all of this fall on the shoulders of

00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:02.993
the erratic drunk who dropped stolen

00:21:02.993 --> 00:21:05.143
papers on the pavement, Guy Burgess?

00:21:05.713 --> 00:21:08.213
And why do many think that, at the end of

00:21:08.213 --> 00:21:10.483
the day, they actually “got away with it”?

00:21:11.763 --> 00:21:13.873
We’ll get into all that, and much

00:21:13.873 --> 00:21:16.413
more, in part three, the final part

00:21:16.413 --> 00:21:18.183
of this mini-series on the most

00:21:18.183 --> 00:21:20.603
successful spy ring in British history.

00:21:23.243 --> 00:21:25.793
Ok then, that’s it for part two.

00:21:26.123 --> 00:21:27.933
Next up it will be our final part,

00:21:28.033 --> 00:21:29.443
part three, where we’ll start to

00:21:29.443 --> 00:21:32.233
see everything unravel, secrets to

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:34.233
be revealed, escapes to be made,

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.693
and beer to be drunk at breakfast.

00:21:37.563 --> 00:21:39.203
You've been listening to English Learning

00:21:39.203 --> 00:21:41.793
for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:21:42.163 --> 00:21:44.553
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.633
I'll catch you in the next episode.

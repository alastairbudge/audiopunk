Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.242 --> 00:00:16.512
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:20.682
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.424 --> 00:00:27.744
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about The Rise of the Great Fashion Houses.

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:32.684
This is actually part two of a three-part series on Fashion.

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:38.314
Part one was on some of the historical curiosities of fashion, where we looked

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:43.024
at how changes in society have led to changes in fashion over the years.

00:00:43.594 --> 00:00:50.734
And part three is going to be on the rise of fast fashion, of modern cheap, disposable, fashion,

00:00:51.094 --> 00:00:56.994
where we’ll look at how this is impacting society, impacting fashion, and impacting the environment.

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:02.314
OK then, The Rise of the Great Fashion Houses.

00:01:03.434 --> 00:01:07.524
In this episode we’ll focus on four fashion houses in particular:

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:11.297
Chanel Gucci, Dior and Versace.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.908
They all, in their own different ways, have left a mark on the world of

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:21.298
fashion, and are some of the most valuable and desirable brands in the world.

00:01:22.108 --> 00:01:28.068
As you may know, Dior and Chanel are French, while Gucci and Versace are Italian.

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:33.158
And France and Italy are two countries that are intrinsically linked

00:01:33.328 --> 00:01:37.358
with fashion, with high quality clothes and people dressing well.

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:45.181
One country that isn’t always associated with great fashion sense is the country I’m from, England.

00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:51.331
So it might surprise you to find out that the person most commonly credited

00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:56.821
as being the world’s first fashion designer was, in fact, an Englishman.

00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:02.951
His name was Charles Frederick Worth, and he established what’s

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:08.838
believed to be the first fashion house, the House of Worth, in 1858.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:15.216
OK, there was a French connection, he lived, worked, and was no doubt inspired,

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:21.156
in Paris, but he was born in the English market town of Bourne, in central

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:26.486
England, which is, I should add, not considered to be a world fashion capital.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.026
Worth’s innovation was to allow his clients to choose the

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:36.956
colours, cloth, and style of the dress before work started on it.

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:42.066
He was also the first person to attach a label inside the

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:45.826
finished pieces of clothing, putting his mark on the item.

00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:52.216
If this doesn’t sound particularly innovative or new to you, it’s

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:57.296
important to remember how people chose clothes for the majority of history.

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:01.656
If you were rich, you would have someone who would take

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:04.456
your measurements and make your clothes to measure.

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:10.226
If you were very rich, if you were Marie Antoinette for example, you might

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:16.116
have a personal dressmaker, someone whose entire job was to make your dresses.

00:03:17.116 --> 00:03:21.176
If you were not rich, you would probably make your clothes yourself

00:03:21.186 --> 00:03:25.446
from bought cloth, or someone in your household would do it for you.

00:03:26.146 --> 00:03:29.776
There simply wasn’t the concept of pre-made clothes.

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:35.566
This only really existed for military uniforms, where everyone had to wear the same

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:41.606
thing, the clothes were male, and being the perfect fit wasn’t of great importance.

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:47.726
I imagine that you are wearing pre-made clothes now - you went to a shop,

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:52.086
found a t-shirt and a pair of trousers that fitted you, and you bought them.

00:03:53.126 --> 00:03:59.706
That “off the peg” style only really started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:03.996
But we’re not talking about “off the peg” fashion now,

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:07.226
we’re talking about something much more glamorous.

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:12.036
And there are few women more associated with glamour than the

00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:16.596
creator of our first fashion house, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel.

00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:23.801
The great fashion house Chanel was founded in 1910 and, coming as it did at the start

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:30.636
of the 20th century, and led by its eponymous founder, Coco Chanel, it signalled a break

00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:36.226
with the complex, over-engineered and oppressive women‘s fashion of the previous century.

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:39.826
Out with corsets and frills!

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:46.036
In with fluid, stylish and boy-like or androgynous shapes.

00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:53.316
Think of the wide-legged, pyjama-style trousers and simple striped tops in the style

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:58.686
of fisherman from Brittany in the north of France that became fashionable in the 1920s.

00:04:59.286 --> 00:05:06.086
The philosophy was, as Coco Chanel put it, “Nothing is more beautiful than freedom of the body.”

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:10.736
Her revolutionary designs became emblems of female

00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:15.766
emancipation, but of a particularly stylish or chic kind.

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:22.006
Coming after a world war when women had needed to do many of the jobs

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:27.696
previously done by men, the fashion reflected female aspiration and lifestyle.

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:33.426
Beginning with a small shop or – to use the French word borrowed into

00:05:33.436 --> 00:05:39.036
English – boutique in Deauville, Normandy in northern France, Coco Chanel

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:44.766
branched out also into costume jewellery, famously saying that the point of

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:51.346
jewellery “isn’t to make a woman look rich but to adorn her–not the same thing.”

00:05:52.646 --> 00:05:55.766
Adorn means to make something more beautiful.

00:05:56.176 --> 00:05:59.986
It’s an important statement, as historically the point of

00:05:59.986 --> 00:06:03.636
jewellery had been precisely to show off how rich you were.

00:06:04.876 --> 00:06:10.146
Coco Chanel‘s nautical look spread: those iconic Breton tops were favoured

00:06:10.146 --> 00:06:15.876
and therefore popularised by such world-famous figures as Pablo Picasso and

00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:20.964
became one of the characteristic styles we associate with brand of Chanel.

00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:26.544
Another was something that became called the Little Black Dress.

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:33.384
If you can’t picture this “little black dress”, it’s simply a loose fitting black dress.

00:06:34.034 --> 00:06:39.084
It might not sound revolutionary to you now, especially as if you were to

00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:43.654
go to Paris you’d probably find a large percentage of the population wearing

00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:49.644
black, but at the time black was reserved for funerals, and it certainly

00:06:49.644 --> 00:06:54.904
wasn’t a colour worn by stylish women, who would typically wear bright colours.

00:06:56.274 --> 00:07:02.064
Chanel changed all that, and by creating this small but elegant black dress,

00:07:02.294 --> 00:07:08.234
she gave women a stylish option, adding that it allowed any woman to “walk

00:07:08.244 --> 00:07:13.724
around like a millionaire”, and with it she pushed forward a fashion revolution.

00:07:14.874 --> 00:07:19.534
Further iconic Chanel creations included the so-called Chanel suit.

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:25.614
As well as reflecting the increasing part that women were starting to play in public

00:07:25.644 --> 00:07:32.454
life, this two-piece suit was inspired by menswear and, in particular, sportswear.

00:07:33.604 --> 00:07:37.374
There is an interesting additional factor to this creation.

00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:43.514
The richest man in Britain, the Duke of Westminster was Coco Chanel’s lover at the time.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:49.768
She observed his no doubt splendid and huge wardrobe or sets of clothes.

00:07:50.748 --> 00:07:55.068
It was not just the cut, the style of his jackets, but

00:07:55.188 --> 00:07:58.408
also the material that was used that caught her eye.

00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:06.238
This was something called tweed, a rough outdoor cloth woven in the western highlands of Scotland

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:12.448
and not previously thought to be suitable material for the finest, haute couture, clothes.

00:08:13.668 --> 00:08:19.438
Chanel would go on to make tweed an integral part of the design of her two-piece suit jacket.

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:24.978
Such stars as Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Brigitte Bardot and

00:08:25.058 --> 00:08:29.548
Princess Diana would wear it, all adding to the fame and desirability

00:08:29.748 --> 00:08:33.928
not just of the Chanel Suit, but of everything Chanel would create.

00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:39.008
And, over 110 years after the first Chanel boutique was opened,

00:08:39.338 --> 00:08:43.688
Chanel is a multibillion dollar brand and as desirable as ever.

00:08:45.188 --> 00:08:52.158
Now, for our next stop we need to go east and south to Italy and, more specifically, to Florence.

00:08:53.088 --> 00:08:58.873
It was here that a man called Guccio Gucci opened his first shop in 1921.

00:08:59.998 --> 00:09:04.658
As a young man, Gucci had worked as a porter at the luxurious

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:09.608
Savoy Hotel in London where he observed the luggage of the wealthy.

00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:15.528
Gucci’s background was in the family business, which made luggage,

00:09:15.808 --> 00:09:19.768
suitcases and so on, as well as equipment for horse riders.

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:25.688
Soon, Guccio Gucci, helped by his three sons, was branching out.

00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:33.158
Interestingly, it was an embargo or set of sanctions imposed upon Italy by the

00:09:33.158 --> 00:09:39.598
League of Nations in 1935 because of Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia–or Ethiopia,

00:09:39.598 --> 00:09:44.848
as it’s called today–it was this that forced an important innovation for Gucci.

00:09:46.098 --> 00:09:51.318
The sanctions led to a shortage of leather, so Gucci had

00:09:51.368 --> 00:09:55.458
to start using fabrics, which he used to his advantage.

00:09:56.538 --> 00:10:03.038
Gucci wanted a way to make his bags more distinctive, more recognisable and because you

00:10:03.038 --> 00:10:09.358
can easily print on fabrics, Gucci created what would become his signature interlocking

00:10:09.378 --> 00:10:14.548
diamond symbol, which was stamped onto every bag, making it instantly recognisable.

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:18.768
Shops proliferated or grew fast.

00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:25.098
In the post-war period, Gucci shops opened all across Europe, then New York,

00:10:25.298 --> 00:10:30.518
Tokyo, and Hong Hong Kong, and there are now around 500 Gucci stores worldwide.

00:10:31.818 --> 00:10:37.468
Perhaps the most significant boost to the fortunes of Gucci came in 1990 when

00:10:37.468 --> 00:10:42.308
the previously unknown but brilliant young designer Tom Ford joined the company.

00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:48.228
When he became Creative Director in 1994, his influence was massive.

00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:55.688
In 1995, his famous Fall 95 collection marked a lucrative new period for the company.

00:10:56.618 --> 00:11:00.508
Such stars as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Lopez and Madonna

00:11:00.518 --> 00:11:03.938
were photographed on the famous red carpet wearing Gucci.

00:11:04.928 --> 00:11:09.728
An important additional factor behind the company's success was, perhaps

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:13.958
counterintuitively, the decreasing influence of the Gucci family.

00:11:15.048 --> 00:11:20.108
This process began in 1989 when an American holdings company,

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:24.328
called Investcorp, bought almost half of the company‘s shares.

00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:32.638
In 1993 Maurizio Gucci, the grandson of the founder, Guccio Gucci, sold his shares

00:11:32.638 --> 00:11:38.098
to Investcorp, meaning that the Gucci family no longer controlled the Gucci brand.

00:11:39.428 --> 00:11:45.388
At this point, I need to introduce the rather gruesome but colourful and intriguing topic

00:11:45.408 --> 00:11:52.848
of the troubled Gucci family history and the murder of Maurizio, Guccio’s grandson, in 1995.

00:11:53.818 --> 00:11:59.108
If you have seen the film, House of Gucci, you will be familiar with all of this.

00:11:59.748 --> 00:12:04.538
In short, Maurizio was murdered by a paid assassin or hitman,

00:12:04.838 --> 00:12:08.388
in Milan as he was about to go into the company's offices.

00:12:09.088 --> 00:12:14.648
The hitman shot him three times in the back and shoulder and then finally in the head.

00:12:15.828 --> 00:12:19.568
Sensationally, the person found guilty of ordering and

00:12:19.788 --> 00:12:24.098
paying for his murder was Maurizio’s former wife Patrizia.

00:12:25.138 --> 00:12:30.390
She ended up serving 18 years in prison, and was released in 2016.

00:12:31.718 --> 00:12:37.598
She was actually offered the opportunity to be freed 5 years earlier, in 2011

00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:42.988
under the condition that she found some sort of work, but she refused, declaring

00:12:43.528 --> 00:12:47.288
"I've never worked a day in my life, and I'm certainly not going to start now".

00:12:48.678 --> 00:12:53.688
Now, it is back to France for our third fashion house, and it’s here that we’ll

00:12:53.688 --> 00:12:58.718
meet a man who went from extreme wealth to extreme poverty, and then back again.

00:12:59.218 --> 00:13:00.448
It’s Christian Dior.

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:04.888
Christian Dior’s eponymous fashion house, Dior, was

00:13:04.888 --> 00:13:09.288
created in 1946, right at the end of the Second World War.

00:13:10.298 --> 00:13:15.848
It was both the best and the worst time to be launching a luxury fashion house.

00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:22.235
Paris had been occupied by the Nazis from June 1940 until August 1944.

00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:28.355
Europe was just recovering from the most catastrophic war in its history, clothing

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:33.575
was rationed, and there wasn’t much money going around to spend on beautiful clothes.

00:13:34.945 --> 00:13:39.015
Paris might have been a cultural centre for style and fashion at the

00:13:39.015 --> 00:13:44.155
start of the 20th century, but the city was a shadow of its former self.

00:13:45.165 --> 00:13:47.725
But Christian Dior sensed an opportunity.

00:13:48.555 --> 00:13:53.155
He had come from a family that was rich–his family owned a wealthy

00:13:53.155 --> 00:13:57.665
fertiliser company–but then had lost it all after the Great Depression.

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:05.105
Dior did his apprenticeship, he cut his teeth, with designers such as Robert Piguet and

00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:10.595
Lucien Lelong, where he was forced to design clothes for the wives of Nazi officers.

00:14:11.415 --> 00:14:17.855
And in 1946, after Paris was free from the Nazis, he set out on his own.

00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:22.755
Now, let’s remember that women’s clothes during the

00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:26.275
second world war had been focussed on practicality.

00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:33.752
Given the rationing, it was all about making the most with what you had, and not wasting anything.

00:14:34.752 --> 00:14:40.162
Dior took this idea and threw it out of the window, he got rid of it completely.

00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:46.082
He wanted a return to the glamour of the past, wanting women who wore his clothes

00:14:46.312 --> 00:14:51.012
to feel that they were wearing something luxurious, over the top, and fabulous.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:59.130
He designed flowery dresses, the complete opposite of the drab, brown and grey wartime uniforms.

00:15:00.008 --> 00:15:05.168
This was, for the time, radical, but it set Dior on the path to

00:15:05.168 --> 00:15:11.748
success, and by the late 1940s Christian Dior was responsible for 75%

00:15:11.958 --> 00:15:18.118
of Paris’ fashion exports and a whopping 5% of France’s total exports.

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:24.838
His style was seized upon by critics and customers alike, with the editor of

00:15:24.838 --> 00:15:30.358
the famous American magazine, Harper’s Bazaar, saying “This is a new look”.

00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:34.578
It certainly was a new look, but Dior wouldn’t live

00:15:34.578 --> 00:15:37.548
long enough to see it for any real length of time.

00:15:38.638 --> 00:15:43.308
In 1957, just 11 years after he started his fashion house,

00:15:43.618 --> 00:15:47.850
he was dead, after suffering a heart attack at the age of 52.

00:15:49.008 --> 00:15:54.678
Luckily he had already appointed a successor, a man he hired when he was only 19 years old.

00:15:55.698 --> 00:15:59.009
The man’s name was Yves Saint Laurent, but Yves Saint

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:02.413
Laurent's tenure at Dior wouldn’t actually last very long.

00:16:02.853 --> 00:16:07.403
He was out by 1960, just 3 years after Christian Dior’s death.

00:16:08.883 --> 00:16:13.509
But, as you’ll no doubt know, this wouldn’t be the end of the road for Yves Saint

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:17.963
Laurent, and he went on to launch his own incredibly successful fashion house.

00:16:18.753 --> 00:16:26.223
And as for Dior, it is another global powerhouse, and is now controlled by LVMH, the huge

00:16:26.263 --> 00:16:33.043
corporation that includes brands such as Moët & Chandon, Hennesy, Louis Vuitton, and Bulgari.

00:16:34.223 --> 00:16:40.633
Now, on to our final fashion house, Versace, or as it should be pronounced, Versace.

00:16:41.973 --> 00:16:45.283
If you say the word Versace to anyone, they will certainly

00:16:45.313 --> 00:16:49.153
think immediately of luxurious and very expensive items.

00:16:49.723 --> 00:16:54.573
They may well call to mind Versace‘s famous symbol, the head of Medusa.

00:16:55.453 --> 00:17:01.623
As you may know, Medusa is a mythological figure, a beautiful woman with snakes for

00:17:01.683 --> 00:17:07.453
hair, who had the ability to mesmerise people and make men fall in love with her.

00:17:08.603 --> 00:17:15.083
The Italian founder of Versace, Gianni Versace, said that he chose this emblem because

00:17:15.123 --> 00:17:20.023
he hoped that people would fall in love with the brand and have no way of going back.

00:17:21.443 --> 00:17:27.003
The Versace story begins later than that of Chanel, Gucci, or Dior,

00:17:27.313 --> 00:17:32.913
when in 1978 Gianni Versace founded his first boutique in Milan.

00:17:34.083 --> 00:17:38.213
Soon known for his innovative designs, with their flashy prints

00:17:38.233 --> 00:17:42.583
and bright but stylish colours, the company’s rise was swift.

00:17:43.893 --> 00:17:50.573
Like Chanel, Gucci and Dior, he expanded into other areas, but clothing was always central.

00:17:51.653 --> 00:17:57.203
His perhaps unique approach was to always make sure that his clothes were worn by the

00:17:57.363 --> 00:18:02.813
up and coming celebrities of the day, meaning his creations would always be in the news.

00:18:03.743 --> 00:18:08.133
Gianni Versace was both a friend and a clothes supplier to such

00:18:08.143 --> 00:18:12.733
iconic stars as Elton John, Michael Jackson, and Princess Diana.

00:18:13.743 --> 00:18:19.143
He was also credited with creating the phenomenon of the supermodel, frequently

00:18:19.143 --> 00:18:24.403
photographed with names such as Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer, and making sure

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:29.513
that the most glamorous models of the day were pictured wearing clothes he had designed.

00:18:30.733 --> 00:18:36.566
As with the tale of Gucci, there is a grim and tragic end to the story of Gianni Versace.

00:18:37.496 --> 00:18:44.158
This was his senseless murder on the steps of his Florida mansion in July 1997.

00:18:44.544 --> 00:18:47.593
But unlike with Gucci, there was no evil wife.

00:18:48.303 --> 00:18:52.623
He was the fourth victim of a serial killer called Andrew Cunanan,

00:18:52.984 --> 00:18:56.573
who was found dead by his own hand within weeks of Gianni’s murder.

00:18:57.523 --> 00:18:59.153
So, there we go.

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:04.513
In brief, the stories of four of the most powerful and important fashion houses

00:19:04.533 --> 00:19:09.435
in the world, and five if we include our perhaps unlikely Englishman at the start.

00:19:10.625 --> 00:19:15.345
It goes without saying that, although the target audience for these great fashion houses

00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:20.925
might be people who are willing to spend hundreds if not thousands of Euros on one item of

00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:26.545
clothing, the trickle-down effect that they have had on what we all wear has been immense.

00:19:28.045 --> 00:19:33.875
First and foremost, these designers were artists, and the human body was their canvas.

00:19:34.345 --> 00:19:40.345
Sure, the clothes they made might have been incredibly expensive, but as Aldo Gucci

00:19:40.465 --> 00:19:46.335
famously once said, “quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten”.

00:19:48.825 --> 00:19:54.315
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Rise of the Great Fashion Houses.

00:19:54.715 --> 00:19:58.155
I hope it's been an interesting one, and no matter whether you are the

00:19:58.155 --> 00:20:02.475
sort of person who only wears Versace or you've never stepped into one

00:20:02.475 --> 00:20:05.755
of these shops in your life, well I hope you've learnt something new.

00:20:06.383 --> 00:20:10.913
As a reminder, this is part two of our three part series on Fashion.

00:20:11.363 --> 00:20:15.163
Part one was on the curiosities of fashion, where we looked at some

00:20:15.323 --> 00:20:19.463
unusual fashions through the ages, and the reasons that fashions change,

00:20:19.723 --> 00:20:23.983
and next up, in part three, we’ll look at the world of fast fashion.

00:20:24.823 --> 00:20:28.203
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:28.653 --> 00:20:34.763
What other fashion designers have had a similar or even greater influence than the four I mentioned?

00:20:35.313 --> 00:20:37.393
Who do you think had the most interesting life?

00:20:37.713 --> 00:20:39.473
Whose influence was the most important?

00:20:40.323 --> 00:20:44.443
And, if you are the sort of person who is really into designer clothes,

00:20:44.753 --> 00:20:48.673
if you could only pick one of the four, who would it be and why?

00:20:49.288 --> 00:20:52.158

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.850
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.240
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.010
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a lady called Elizabeth

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.470
Alexandra Mary Windsor, a lady you probably know by the name “Queen Elizabeth II”.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.160
We’ll talk about the life of Queen Elizabeth,  how she was never meant to be

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.210
queen in the first place, how she, and the country developed over the years.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.520
We’ll talk about some of the controversies she has survived, how she changed the

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.510
monarchy, and we’ll also have time to hear about some unusual experiences she has had.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.200
And of course we will also talk about the particular type of English that she

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.170
uses, a type of English so famous that it has its own name, “The Queen’s English”.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:11.045
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:12.015 --> 00:01:17.285
Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was never meant to be queen, and in

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:23.157
more ways than one her almost 70 years on the throne have been unlikely.

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:28.997
For starters, until 2013, when the law was changed, a

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:32.637
son came above a daughter in the line of succession.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:41.105
That is, no matter how many daughters a king or queen had, and how old they were, if a son

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:47.715
was born he would automatically go to the front of the line when the king or queen died.

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:53.535
So, as a woman, the odds were already against the young Elizabeth.

00:01:54.213 --> 00:02:00.883
She had a younger sister, Margaret, who was no competition, but if her parents had another

00:02:00.883 --> 00:02:07.623
child who was male, a son, he would leapfrog both of them in the line of succession.

00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:13.983
What’s more, neither Elizabeth’s father nor mother were on the throne

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:18.755
when she was born, nor were they directly in line to the throne.

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:26.359
When she was born, in 1926, her grandfather, King George V, was King of England.

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.009
He had five sons and two daughters.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.039
His second son, George, was Elizabeth’s father.

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:42.541
Next in line to the throne in the event of King George V’s death would be his first son, Edward.

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:49.804
And so it was, when George V died in 1936, when Elizabeth was 10 years

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:54.834
old, that the throne passed to her uncle, who became Edward VIII.

00:02:55.814 --> 00:02:57.714
He wasn’t to last for long though.

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:02.914
He was in love with an American lady called Wallis Simpson, who had

00:03:03.044 --> 00:03:07.834
already divorced one man and was in the process of divorcing another.

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:14.554
Long story short, there was strong opposition to the new king’s relationship with

00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:21.914
this American divorcée, and instead of leaving her, he left the monarchy, abdicating

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:27.724
his position as king and passing the throne to his brother, Elizabeth’s father.

00:03:28.614 --> 00:03:32.014
To state the obvious, this was unexpected.

00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:34.304
It had never happened before.

00:03:34.604 --> 00:03:38.904
No British monarch had ever voluntarily given up the

00:03:38.924 --> 00:03:43.454
throne before, especially for something as trivial as love.

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:48.814
Elizabeth’s father became king, much to his surprise as well.

00:03:49.414 --> 00:03:55.922
And in an instant, or at least in under a year, Elizabeth went from being a relatively

00:03:56.122 --> 00:04:03.062
minor young royal to being next in line to the throne, aged only 10 years old.

00:04:04.072 --> 00:04:08.602
Even though her father was now king, he was only 40 years old.

00:04:09.662 --> 00:04:14.675
Young, comparatively speaking, and Elizabeth no doubt thought that she would be

00:04:14.685 --> 00:04:21.625
able to live out her childhood in relative obscurity, as a semi-normal person

00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:27.466
before having to take on the duties of queen herself, if that was what was required.

00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:29.236
It wasn’t to be.

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:36.486
In 1952, after 15 years on the throne, her father died of a blood clot,

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:41.686
when Elizabeth was only a couple of months away from her 26th birthday.

00:04:42.806 --> 00:04:49.894
Like many men at the time, he had been a heavy smoker and died shortly after his 56th birthday.

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:56.067
Elizabeth was in Kenya at the time, on a tour with her new husband, Phillip.

00:04:56.557 --> 00:05:00.367
She learned of her father’s death from the local news.

00:05:01.262 --> 00:05:06.452
In an instant all eyes were on her, on this 25 year old girl.

00:05:07.422 --> 00:05:12.132
Up until then, she had lived a relatively secluded life.

00:05:12.322 --> 00:05:19.032
She hadn’t gone to school, and instead had been taught by private tutors at her family home.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:25.512
As a young woman, Elizabeth had got married, she had enjoyed time living in Malta with

00:05:25.512 --> 00:05:30.872
her new husband, Prince Phillip, and she had been enjoying life out of the spotlight.

00:05:31.862 --> 00:05:39.242
Her father had been unwell for several years, and had actually had his left lung removed.

00:05:39.816 --> 00:05:44.918
So Elizabeth, in preparation for the day she would become queen,

00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:50.608
reportedly brought black clothes with her wherever she went, just in

00:05:50.608 --> 00:05:55.748
case she received the news and had to change into mourning clothes.

00:05:56.327 --> 00:06:01.767
So she was prepared, from a practical view at least, but no doubt

00:06:02.007 --> 00:06:06.457
there is not much that can really prepare you for life as Queen.

00:06:07.637 --> 00:06:13.157
At her coronation, in 1953, she became the most famous woman in

00:06:13.157 --> 00:06:17.857
the country, and one of the most famous women in the entire world.

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:23.177
Her face was on the money not only in the UK but in Canada,

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:28.257
Australia, and all over British colonies in Africa and the Caribbean.

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:32.267
She was on postage stamps, she was all over the newspapers.

00:06:32.597 --> 00:06:36.357
You could take a picture of the queen to almost any town

00:06:36.377 --> 00:06:40.467
or village in the world and people would know who she was.

00:06:41.497 --> 00:06:46.327
To state the obvious, it must have been an incredible amount of pressure

00:06:46.347 --> 00:06:52.247
for anyone, but especially for someone who had grown up in a tiny bubble.

00:06:53.147 --> 00:06:57.117
Now, let’s quickly reflect on the world, and the country,

00:06:57.197 --> 00:07:01.070
that Elizabeth found when she became queen in 1952.

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:06.887
The Second World War had finished only 7 years before, there was still

00:07:07.037 --> 00:07:12.477
rationing in Britain, meaning that there were still limits on food and certain

00:07:12.477 --> 00:07:18.387
goods, and indeed the queen used her ration coupons to buy her wedding dress.

00:07:19.387 --> 00:07:24.827
Britain still had colonies all over the world, Europe was rebounding, the

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:29.987
United States had been fighting in Korea, the Cold War was just getting started.

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:37.657
By 1952 the process initiated by the first majority Labour government

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:42.547
in Britain of getting rid of colonies and starting the Commonwealth

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:48.087
was well underway, and Britain’s empire was firmly on the decline.

00:07:49.227 --> 00:07:55.312
And talking specifically about the British monarchy, the public hated the queen’s

00:07:55.332 --> 00:08:01.952
uncle, Edward VIII for abdicating, and his brother, King George VI had a tough

00:08:01.972 --> 00:08:07.572
job at trying to win back public support and trust in the British monarchy.

00:08:08.318 --> 00:08:12.928
The post-war period was a period of change in the UK.

00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:21.003
People questioned the status quo,  the Labour government introduced heavy taxes on wealth, and

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:27.143
there were real question marks over whether the UK should have a monarch as its head of state.

00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:33.083
Looking across the Channel, France seemed to be doing ok without a monarch, Italy

00:08:33.243 --> 00:08:38.339
had got rid of its monarch, and let’s not forget that the British people had

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:43.989
revolted against their monarch before, and executed the king and abolished the

00:08:43.989 --> 00:08:50.889
monarchy in 1649, so it wasn’t a complete impossibility that it could happen again.

00:08:51.619 --> 00:08:56.949
So, when Elizabeth was crowned queen, the UK, its monarchy, and the

00:08:56.949 --> 00:09:02.523
wider world was in a slightly precarious, a difficult, situation.

00:09:03.286 --> 00:09:09.739
If she makes it to February 6th of 2022, when she will only be a couple of months

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:15.254
away from her 96th birthday, she will become the first monarch to celebrate

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:21.404
her platinum jubilee, the celebration of 70 years on the British throne.

00:09:22.194 --> 00:09:26.988
To state the obvious, a lot has happened in those 70 years, in the

00:09:27.018 --> 00:09:31.168
UK, to the world, to the monarchy, and to the queen personally.

00:09:31.908 --> 00:09:35.648
Instead of going through the queen’s life chronologically,

00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:39.018
we are going to focus on three main themes.

00:09:39.968 --> 00:09:45.718
Firstly, her personal life, and how much we know about her as a human being.

00:09:46.538 --> 00:09:51.418
Secondly, how the monarchy has changed with her at its head.

00:09:52.108 --> 00:09:58.827
And thirdly, the controversies she has managed to survive and the problems she has faced.

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:01.387
So, her personal life.

00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:07.177
It is somewhat of a contradiction that the queen might be one of the most famous

00:10:07.207 --> 00:10:13.497
women in the world, yet we really know very little about her as a human being.

00:10:14.257 --> 00:10:19.487
Throughout the years she has remained mute, silent, on political

00:10:19.487 --> 00:10:24.717
issues, and we really don’t know what she thinks about almost anything.

00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:31.407
People have interpreted various things she has done as being signs of her beliefs,

00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:37.737
for example wearing a hat that looked a little bit like the EU flag was interpreted

00:10:37.977 --> 00:10:43.707
as showing her support of the EU, but we really don’t know what she actually thinks.

00:10:44.807 --> 00:10:50.247
Royal commentators have always commented on her sense of duty and loyalty to

00:10:50.247 --> 00:10:56.767
the crown, and suggested that she wants to remain almost invisible, anonymous,

00:10:56.837 --> 00:11:03.767
because the important thing is what she represents–the British monarchy–and showing

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:09.057
her personality and true character would get in the way of what she represents.

00:11:10.097 --> 00:11:13.197
We do know a little bit about what she likes.

00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:18.767
In particular, she is a huge fan of a type of dog called a

00:11:18.827 --> 00:11:23.247
Corgi, which is a type of small dog originally from Wales.

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:29.494
On an interesting linguistic note, the word “corgi” actually comes from the

00:11:29.494 --> 00:11:36.174
Welsh words for “cor”, meaning dwarf, or very small, and “ci”, meaning dog.

00:11:36.664 --> 00:11:40.374
So “corgi” just means “dwarf dog” in Welsh.

00:11:41.084 --> 00:11:48.194
In any case, the Queen loves them, and has had over 30 different corgis over the course of her life.

00:11:48.804 --> 00:11:53.854
They are, reportedly, not very well behaved, and run all over

00:11:53.904 --> 00:11:58.354
Buckingham Palace, sitting on the sofas and generally causing trouble.

00:11:59.074 --> 00:12:04.328
There are all sort of stories about how the Queen does things like drinks a glass of

00:12:04.328 --> 00:12:10.138
champagne every night before bed, and how she has been wearing the same nail polish

00:12:10.358 --> 00:12:18.157
since 1989, but these stories tend to use a lot of “anonymous sources”, and although they

00:12:18.157 --> 00:12:24.037
might make for fun newspaper articles, they’re probably as much fiction as they are fact.

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:31.767
Our second theme is how the monarchy has changed under her tenure, while she has been queen.

00:12:32.977 --> 00:12:38.077
As far as this is concerned, even the most devout republican would

00:12:38.087 --> 00:12:42.751
have to admit that the Queen has been effective at modernising the

00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:48.521
British monarchy and appealing to the public, both in the UK and abroad.

00:12:49.382 --> 00:12:53.825
She and other members of the Royal Family have made thousands of public

00:12:53.825 --> 00:12:59.855
appearances, visiting hospitals, schools, becoming patrons of charities.

00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:04.915
She has allowed documentaries to be made about the Royal Family, and has

00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:10.805
presented the Royal Family as more accessible and more human than ever before.

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:17.588
And this is in a large part due to the queen, personally, due to Elizabeth.

00:13:18.228 --> 00:13:23.578
She as an individual is still very popular in the UK and abroad.

00:13:24.348 --> 00:13:31.788
In the UK, recent surveys have around 72% of the population saying that they approve of her.

00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:36.288
She is also hugely popular in America.

00:13:36.778 --> 00:13:43.758
There’s been a national poll in America of the public’s most admired man and women every year.

00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:53.468
Since 1948, the Queen has been in the “top ten” list 38 times, more than any other woman in history.

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:59.348
The second, by the way, is Jackie Kennedy, who has appeared 27 times.

00:14:00.108 --> 00:14:05.688
In 2021, the prime minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, when he

00:14:05.688 --> 00:14:10.548
was asked about Australia becoming a republic, said, about the queen.

00:14:10.948 --> 00:14:15.958
“She's been an extraordinary head of state, and I think frankly, in

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:20.448
Australia, there are more Elizabethans than there are monarchists”.

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:25.285
So, he is saying that people in Australia are bigger fans

00:14:25.485 --> 00:14:29.665
of the queen the person than what the queen represents.

00:14:30.575 --> 00:14:36.865
This is somewhat ironic, given how hard the queen tries to hide her personality

00:14:37.025 --> 00:14:42.905
and put all the focus on what she represents, but she would no doubt be happy that

00:14:42.905 --> 00:14:48.325
she is helping solidify the reputation of the monarchy for the next generation.

00:14:49.205 --> 00:14:53.615
It hasn’t, of course, all been simple for the queen, and this

00:14:53.635 --> 00:14:58.895
leads us on to our third part: the controversies and tougher times.

00:15:00.035 --> 00:15:04.135
She has made some bad mistakes, and there have been plenty of

00:15:04.135 --> 00:15:07.715
times when it looked like it would be difficult to come back.

00:15:09.005 --> 00:15:13.415
1992, for example, she called her “annus horribilis”.

00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:18.075
Two of her children, Anne and Andrew, separated from their partners.

00:15:18.405 --> 00:15:24.175
It was revealed that her eldest son, Charles, was having an affair, and there were

00:15:24.205 --> 00:15:30.365
intimate conversations published between Princess Diana and another man, James Gilbey.

00:15:31.148 --> 00:15:37.028
There was even a large fire at one of her residences, Windsor Castle, and there was a

00:15:37.068 --> 00:15:43.758
public outcry when it was suggested that the repairs would be paid for with public money.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:50.670
As a result, the queen agreed to partially pay for it herself, and also agreed

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:56.840
to start paying income tax, which as a monarch she wasn’t legally required to do.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:03.050
In 1995 Princess Diana was killed, and the Queen’s reaction to

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.670
her death was considered by many to be emotionless and cold.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:13.930
Indeed, her popularity reduced dramatically in the period after Diana's

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:20.520
death, and a record 17% of Brits said that the monarchy should be abolished.

00:16:21.304 --> 00:16:28.159
Yes, 17% isn’t that much, but just three and a half years before, partly out of

00:16:28.159 --> 00:16:33.979
sympathy for the queen’s terrible year, only 9% of people wanted to abolish it.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:41.329
More recently, as you may be aware, her grandson Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle,

00:16:41.619 --> 00:16:47.219
decided that they would remove themselves from the British monarchy, and did several high

00:16:47.229 --> 00:16:53.859
profile interviews directly and indirectly criticising senior members of the royal family.

00:16:54.919 --> 00:17:00.909
And let’s not forget the ongoing problems with her third, and reportedly favourite,

00:17:00.909 --> 00:17:06.949
son, Andrew, and his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:15.319
As far as the queen’s mistakes go, it is worth reminding ourselves that the queen is 95 years

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:23.009
old, was married for 73 years and has had 4 children, the oldest of whom is 72 years old.

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:28.809
It’s a long life and a larger than average family, so it is only

00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:32.779
human that there will be mistakes and unhappiness along the way.

00:17:33.499 --> 00:17:37.569
The main difference is that her mistakes and unhappiness are

00:17:37.879 --> 00:17:42.169
incredibly public, and are splashed all over the newspapers.

00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:48.699
Critics of the queen would certainly say that the fact that she has ended up with three

00:17:48.729 --> 00:17:55.349
of her four children in failed marriages, and her reportedly favourite child, Andrew,

00:17:55.469 --> 00:18:01.429
accused of sex abuse suggests that she may have neglected her duties as a parent.

00:18:02.569 --> 00:18:08.769
Now, as a final part to today’s episode, let’s talk about the language of Queen Elizabeth.

00:18:09.639 --> 00:18:13.049
You have probably heard the expression “The Queen’s English”.

00:18:13.419 --> 00:18:17.459
Some people think that this is the same as BBC English

00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:20.989
or Received Pronunciation, but it’s really not.

00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:25.919
Or at least the Queen doesn’t speak in BBC English or in

00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:29.989
Received Pronunciation or what we might call “Standard English”.

00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:34.519
I’ll play a little clip of her speaking in a minute, but there

00:18:34.519 --> 00:18:38.309
are a few things I want to tell you to look out for first.

00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:47.109
Firstly, look out for how she pronounces “o” - it’s more like “ohh”, it’s a very guttural sound.

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:54.509
Listen to how she says “ago” and “often”, instead of “ago” and “often”.

00:18:55.379 --> 00:19:02.899
Her vowel sounds tend to be quite a lot longer, so she says “heyappy” rather

00:19:02.899 --> 00:19:08.839
than “happy”, listen out for it in “Happy Christmas” (or "Happy Christimas").

00:19:09.729 --> 00:19:16.019
The clip I’m actually playing is from her first Christmas Broadcast, by the way, in 1957.

00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:19.559
She has made a Christmas message ever since.

00:19:20.613 --> 00:19:25.303
Listen to this one first, then we’ll see how her voice has changed over the years.

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:27.873
OK, here goes.

00:19:28.822 --> 00:19:33.382
Happy Christmas, 25 years ago.

00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:37.762
My grandfather broadcast the first of these Christmas messages.

00:19:39.142 --> 00:19:43.822
Today is another landmark because television has made it possible

00:19:44.272 --> 00:19:47.812
for many of you to see me in your homes on Christmas Day.

00:19:49.942 --> 00:19:54.423
Interestingly enough, her accent has actually softened quite a bit

00:19:54.483 --> 00:19:59.483
since this first speech, which you could also see as an example of

00:19:59.483 --> 00:20:05.033
her adapting to be more normal, speaking more like a normal person.

00:20:05.923 --> 00:20:11.443
Of course, her accent is still far from normal, but as you’ll see in the next

00:20:11.463 --> 00:20:16.403
clip, it is a lot less pronounced than it was when she first took the throne.

00:20:19.143 --> 00:20:22.153
Here's her speaking in one of her most recent Christmas messages.

00:20:23.089 --> 00:20:24.349
We will be with our friends.

00:20:24.349 --> 00:20:29.929
Again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again,

00:20:31.069 --> 00:20:35.359
but for now I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.

00:20:36.493 --> 00:20:37.643
Can you see the difference?

00:20:38.153 --> 00:20:39.267
Here they are again for you.

00:20:39.706 --> 00:20:44.266
Happy Christmas, 25 years ago.

00:20:45.076 --> 00:20:48.646
My grandfather broadcast the first of these Christmas messages.

00:20:50.026 --> 00:20:54.106
Today is another landmark because television has made it

00:20:54.106 --> 00:20:58.346
possible for many of you to see me in your homes on Christmas.

00:20:58.416 --> 00:20:58.696
Day

00:21:00.178 --> 00:21:01.438
We will be with our friends.

00:21:01.438 --> 00:21:07.018
Again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again,

00:21:08.158 --> 00:21:12.448
but for now I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.

00:21:13.921 --> 00:21:18.378
Now, just because this is the queen speaking, please don’t think that you need

00:21:18.388 --> 00:21:23.758
to speak like that - if you copied this accent perfectly people would look at you

00:21:23.758 --> 00:21:29.188
in a very strange way, so there is absolutely no need to speak the way she does.

00:21:30.328 --> 00:21:35.778
OK, we have time for a couple more unusual stories about the life of the queen.

00:21:36.684 --> 00:21:43.054
Firstly, did you know that once a drunk man managed to climb over the fences

00:21:43.174 --> 00:21:48.764
of Buckingham Palace, the queen’s official residence, managed to get into

00:21:48.764 --> 00:21:52.924
the palace and actually into the queen’s bedroom while she was sleeping?

00:21:53.534 --> 00:21:54.094
It’s true.

00:21:54.524 --> 00:21:59.154
A man called Michael Fagan managed to get into Buckingham Palace in

00:21:59.154 --> 00:22:04.084
1982 and found his way to the queen’s bedroom while she was sleeping.

00:22:05.274 --> 00:22:09.094
Thankfully, nothing terrible happened, and it’s still not

00:22:09.114 --> 00:22:13.704
clear exactly what his motivations were, why he did it.

00:22:14.554 --> 00:22:18.494
Over the years he has claimed that he was in love with the queen, that

00:22:18.704 --> 00:22:22.954
he was on drugs, and that he hoped she could help him in some way.

00:22:23.614 --> 00:22:29.584
It caused a huge scandal, and since then security has been significantly tightened.

00:22:30.524 --> 00:22:35.964
The queen also, as part of her plan to make the royal family more approachable,

00:22:36.124 --> 00:22:41.634
has answered more than 3.5 million different letters from members of the

00:22:41.634 --> 00:22:46.734
public, and sent more than half a million cards to people in Britain who have

00:22:46.754 --> 00:22:51.754
either turned 100 years old or celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary.

00:22:52.663 --> 00:22:57.653
And over the years of travelling all over the world and being given presents

00:22:57.673 --> 00:23:02.503
from people from all different countries, she has amassed quite a collection.

00:23:03.303 --> 00:23:11.093
It reportedly includes an elephant, a pair of cowboy boots, 7kg of prawns, and two tortoises.

00:23:11.873 --> 00:23:15.903
Now, the question that you might be thinking, and one

00:23:15.913 --> 00:23:20.283
we haven’t yet covered, is what happens when she dies?

00:23:21.323 --> 00:23:28.713
Well, on a practical level, the throne will pass to her eldest son Charles, assuming he is still

00:23:28.713 --> 00:23:35.653
alive, and he will either become king or decide to pass it straight down to his son, Prince William.

00:23:36.313 --> 00:23:40.663
Opinion polls suggest people would love him to do this,

00:23:40.703 --> 00:23:44.283
to pass it to Prince William, but it seems unlikely.

00:23:45.483 --> 00:23:47.964
In any case, that’s the easy part.

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:54.683
The harder part is how the British monarchy moves on, how it opens a new chapter.

00:23:55.213 --> 00:24:00.653
Queen Elizabeth is already the longest-serving monarch in British history, and at

00:24:00.653 --> 00:24:06.253
the time of making this episode the fourth longest serving monarch in world history.

00:24:07.193 --> 00:24:11.403
She is only two and a half years away from being the longest-serving

00:24:11.403 --> 00:24:17.573
monarch in history, and she would overtake Louis XIV of France, who got

00:24:17.573 --> 00:24:22.223
a bit of a head start on her because he became king at the age of four.

00:24:23.393 --> 00:24:27.503
She has been a remarkably consistent figure in UK history.

00:24:27.863 --> 00:24:32.013
She has lived through a world war, there have been 14 different prime

00:24:32.013 --> 00:24:37.323
ministers that have served under her, and 4 out of 5 people in Britain,

00:24:37.583 --> 00:24:41.773
including myself I should add, weren’t alive when she was crowned queen.

00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:49.223
So, the vast majority of people in Britain, everyone under the age of 68

00:24:49.223 --> 00:24:54.193
to be precise, has only lived under one British monarch: Queen Elizabeth.

00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:59.453
She may have her flaws, but is certainly a remarkable woman.

00:25:00.363 --> 00:25:06.543
One of the great ironies, however, is that although she is one of the most recognisable people on

00:25:06.543 --> 00:25:13.953
the planet, and she exists on banknotes, coins, and postage stamps all over the world there will be

00:25:13.953 --> 00:25:20.583
very few people who will ever be able to say that they have really known the true Queen Elizabeth.

00:25:22.453 --> 00:25:28.774
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the life and times of Queen Elizabeth II.

00:25:29.371 --> 00:25:32.851
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:37.561
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:44.341
I know that the queen and the British monarchy is a subject of great fascination for lots of

00:25:44.351 --> 00:25:50.974
people outside the UK, so tell me, what do people think about Queen Elizabeth in your country?

00:25:51.434 --> 00:25:54.434
What do you think will happen when she is gone?

00:25:54.874 --> 00:25:56.094
I would love to know.

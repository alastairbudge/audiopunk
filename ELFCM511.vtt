Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.470
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.770
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.140
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the death of Princess Diana.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.569
It is the story of a princess, the press, the royal family, and

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.419
what people called the utterly preventable death of a young woman.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.290
OK then, let’s get started and talk about the death of Princess Diana.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.220
In the early hours of Sunday, August 31st, 1997, a black Mercedes-Benz

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.130
entered the Pont de l'Alma underpass, a tunnel under the Seine River in Paris.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.317
The car was going fast, with later reports estimating it was travelling at 105

00:01:05.317 --> 00:01:11.300
kilometres per hour, more than double the tunnel’s 50 kilometres per hour speed limit.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.310
There was a good reason for this, or at least, you can understand why the driver was going so fast.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:27.140
The car was being chased by a reported 30 paparazzi photographers on mopeds and in cars.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.120
Cameras were flashing as the photographers weaved around the car, poking

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.600
their cameras at the tinted windows, the shutters clicking non-stop.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.774
For inside the car was Diana, Princess of Wales, the former husband of the heir to

00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:49.284
the British throne and almost certainly the most recognisable woman in the world.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:55.014
Next to her was Dodi Fayed, the son of the Egyptian businessman

00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:59.164
and owner of the Harrods department store, Mohammad Al-Fayed.

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:04.894
Nobody knows exactly what Diana and Dodi were talking about on

00:02:04.894 --> 00:02:09.434
that trip back, but the whole world would know what happened next.

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:15.861
At exactly 23 minutes past 12, shortly after entering

00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:19.679
the tunnel, the driver lost control of the car.

00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:26.541
The Mercedes smashed into another car and then crashed head-on into a pillar.

00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.901
Neither Dodi nor Diana were wearing a seat belt.

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:37.021
Dodi Fayed was pronounced dead at the scene, along with the driver, Henri Paul.

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:41.911
Diana was still alive, as was the only other occupant of

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:45.901
the car, Dodi’s bodyguard, a man called Trevor Rees-Jones.

00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:52.751
She was still conscious and was able to talk to the doctors who were fighting to save her life.

00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:57.541
Unfortunately, it was an unwinnable fight.

00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:03.451
The impact from the crash had been so great that her heart was pushed out

00:03:03.531 --> 00:03:09.311
of place and this tore a pulmonary vein, causing massive internal bleeding.

00:03:10.701 --> 00:03:15.801
At 4:00 in the morning, after almost three and a half hours of French

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:21.261
doctors fighting to save her life, Diana Princess of Wales, the woman

00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:24.991
many people had thought would become queen, was pronounced dead.

00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:30.041
This much of the story I imagine you will know already.

00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:36.331
But what we will do in this episode is try to go a level deeper, and unpack

00:03:36.351 --> 00:03:41.414
what was happening before the crash, the crash itself, and its aftermath.

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:48.211
But first, let me give a very brief reminder about the protagonist of our story.

00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.841
Princess Diana, or Diana Spencer as she was before she became a

00:03:53.841 --> 00:04:00.271
princess, was born on July 1st, 1961, to an aristocratic British family.

00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:07.821
Her family had extensive ties to the royal family - Diana was a distant cousin of

00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:13.081
Charles’, Diana’s grandmother was friends with Charles’ grandmother, and Diana’s

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:18.431
family even lived in a large mansion that they rented from Queen Elizabeth.

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:23.291
On the surface, Diana had a very privileged upbringing.

00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:27.651
But emotionally, it was not a happy one.

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:33.371
Her mother left her father when she was 7 years old, and

00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:37.661
Diana would later say that her childhood was very unhappy.

00:04:38.883 --> 00:04:44.431
Her family was well-known in aristocratic British circles, but it wasn’t until her

00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:50.141
relationship with Prince Charles that she truly became a household name across the world.

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.361
At the age of 20, she married Prince Charles in a

00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:59.471
ceremony that was watched by over 750 million people.

00:05:00.021 --> 00:05:05.891
It was a spectacle of royal pomp and glamour that made her an icon overnight.

00:05:07.351 --> 00:05:12.281
But while her marriage to Prince Charles was made out to be a fairytale

00:05:12.531 --> 00:05:16.971
for the press and the public, the reality was quite different.

00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:22.411
Behind the scenes, the marriage was troubled from the start, with the

00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:26.951
most well-known issue being Charles’ ongoing affair with his former

00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.271
lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, who you might know is now his wife.

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:41.331
Diana and Charles separated in 1992, and would officially divorce 4 years later, in 1996.

00:05:42.171 --> 00:05:47.051
In the interests of balance, Diana also had her own fair share of affairs,

00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:52.441
but she emerged from the divorce in a much more positive light than Charles.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.981
And she stood on her own two feet, she was a public figure in her own right.

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:05.371
She became deeply involved in humanitarian causes, including raising

00:06:05.371 --> 00:06:09.751
awareness about AIDS and campaigning against the use of landmines.

00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:13.671
She did things that no royal had previously done.

00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.431
She hugged a man suffering from AIDS.

00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:22.521
which was hugely important in debunking the myth that you could catch HIV through physical contact.

00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:29.701
She walked through a field of live landmines, she had a warmth, approachability and humanity that

00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:36.511
no member of the royal family had previously shown, and you could reasonably argue has shown since.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.991
Her warmth and charisma made her the so-called

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:44.841
“People’s Princess,” loved by millions around the world.

00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:51.091
She had this rare ability to connect with people, particularly the vulnerable

00:06:51.091 --> 00:06:57.371
and marginalised, and this made her immeasurably popular at home and abroad.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:02.371
But this popularity came at a price.

00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:09.491
She was relentlessly pursued by the press in a way that no royal before and after ever has been.

00:07:10.631 --> 00:07:15.451
The tabloids followed her every move, and the public’s fascination with

00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:20.931
her personal life, her relationships, and her charity work was insatiable.

00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:27.291
She was constantly hounded by photographers, and the scrutiny was so intense that

00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:33.051
Diana publicly spoke out in a TV interview about quite how difficult it was to live

00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:38.541
under the media’s microscope and how she felt that she lived in a goldfish bowl.

00:07:39.551 --> 00:07:43.321
It was this obsession with photographing her, as we’ll come on to talk

00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:48.191
about in a minute, that some people said ultimately led to her tragic death.

00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:53.101
So, what was happening in the lead-up to the crash?

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:55.972
Why was Diana in Paris that night?

00:07:56.221 --> 00:07:59.212
And what role did the paparazzi play in it all?

00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:07.111
Diana and Dodi Fayed had only met 6 weeks before, but it was a whirlwind romance.

00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:12.471
They spent the summer of 1997 together, travelling on Dodi’s father’s yacht

00:08:12.661 --> 00:08:17.617
in the Mediterranean and staying at his family’s villa in the South of France.

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:23.507
Although it had only been going on for a few weeks, their relationship

00:08:23.717 --> 00:08:29.117
had captured the attention of the press, and speculation was rampant

00:08:29.337 --> 00:08:33.157
about whether the couple were about to announce an engagement.

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:39.087
On the evening of August 30th, they ate at the restaurant of the Ritz

00:08:39.087 --> 00:08:43.497
Hotel in Paris, which was owned by Dodi’s father, Mohammed Al-Fayed.

00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:48.187
After dinner, they decided to leave and head back to Dodi’s

00:08:48.187 --> 00:08:51.837
apartment, before leaving for London the following morning.

00:08:53.107 --> 00:08:58.417
The problem was, as always, the hordes of paparazzi waiting eagerly outside

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:02.387
the hotel, knowing that Diana and Dodi would have to leave eventually.

00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:08.197
But Dodi had a plan to throw them off, to trick them.

00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:14.960
A decoy car was sent to the front of the Ritz, while Diana and Dodi slipped

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.740
out through a secret door at the back of the hotel and into the Mercedes.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.970
But the plan didn’t work.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.100
They were spotted.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:30.230
The paparazzi were soon on their tail, chasing the car through the streets of Paris.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.900
This takes us back to that tunnel, to the fateful moment when

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.170
Henri Paul lost control and the car smashed into a pillar.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:46.690
In the immediate aftermath of the news, there was an almost national sense of bereavement in the UK.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.890
An estimated 1 million people travelled to London to pay their respects

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.550
to her, leaving bouquets of flowers and letters of condolence outside

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.150
Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, her private residence.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:06.770
The news was full of interviews with members of the public in tears, people who had never

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:13.470
met Diana but felt like they had lost a loved one of their own, a wife, mother or sister.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.620
And Britain isn’t known to be a nation of people who

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.090
are particularly comfortable with their emotions.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:27.200
You might know the term “stiff upper lip”, which is this idea that it is honourable

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.470
to avoid showing any emotion, even in times of great sadness and despair.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.630
But something was different.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.870
There were men, women and children in tears at the loss of this woman they had never met.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.770
Commentators would later point to it as a defining moment in British history, a

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.550
time when people in Britain became comfortable with displaying their emotions.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.470
For one family in Britain, however, there was no such emotional awakening.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.200
The Royal Family was staying at Balmoral Castle, its large country estate in Scotland.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:13.100
There were some token public statements put out in the press, but the Queen and the

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:19.680
wider royal family were criticised for what was interpreted as a cold and emotionlesss

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:25.500
reaction, especially compared to the outpouring of grief from the general public.

00:11:26.516 --> 00:11:31.459
Diana’s funeral took place a week after her death, on September 6th,

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:37.690
and was watched by an estimated 2.5 billion people across the world.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.480
If you were one of them, you might remember that her sons, the then 12 and

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:49.510
15-year-old, Harry and William, walked behind the funeral procession, together

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:54.440
with Prince Charles, Prince Phillip, and Diana’s brother, the Earl of Spencer.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:00.670
The inclusion of the boys in the funeral procession was highly contentious,

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.670
and was criticised by many as showing an utter lack of compassion.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.870
After all, these were two boys who had just lost their mother, and they were being

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:18.810
forced to grieve in front of a live crowd of millions and billions more watching on TV.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.519
Unsurprisingly, Prince William would later say that walking behind his

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:27.823
mother's coffin was one of the hardest things that he has ever done.

00:12:29.043 --> 00:12:32.283
As you may remember, the guest list at the funeral service

00:12:32.283 --> 00:12:36.443
itself was a veritable who’s-who of notable figures.

00:12:36.963 --> 00:12:43.023
World leaders, past and present, kings and queens, musicians, Hollywood actors and directors.

00:12:44.003 --> 00:12:49.573
There had initially been concerns that the funeral shouldn’t have been held in Westminster Abbey,

00:12:49.913 --> 00:12:55.583
a large cathedral in London, partly because there wouldn’t have been enough guests to fill it.

00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:59.983
These concerns were clearly unfounded.

00:13:00.713 --> 00:13:05.813
Every seat was filled and an estimated 2.5 million people

00:13:06.043 --> 00:13:09.323
descended on the streets of London to pay their respects.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:15.313
In the weeks and months afterwards, questions started to be asked about

00:13:15.313 --> 00:13:19.523
who was to blame, and whether her death could have been prevented.

00:13:20.703 --> 00:13:25.733
Was it simply a tragic accident, or were there other forces at play?

00:13:26.623 --> 00:13:31.403
Mohammed Al-Fayed, Dodi’s father, pointed the finger directly at the

00:13:31.403 --> 00:13:35.983
royal family and made the shocking accusation that Diana and his son

00:13:35.993 --> 00:13:40.503
were murdered in a plot orchestrated by the British establishment.

00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:47.033
Many pointed the finger at Henri Paul, the driver, as tests later revealed

00:13:47.263 --> 00:13:51.993
he had been drinking alcohol and he was four times the legal limit.

00:13:53.213 --> 00:13:57.973
In other words, he was drunk, he crashed, and that’s the end of it.

00:13:59.223 --> 00:14:03.995
Others lay the blame squarely with the paparazzi, arguing that their

00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:08.663
pursuit had forced Henri Paul to drive at reckless speeds to avoid them.

00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:13.943
The paparazzi had never given her an inch of privacy and to her

00:14:13.943 --> 00:14:18.133
last breath had used her as a product to squeeze money out of.

00:14:19.433 --> 00:14:24.743
And in one final display of the transactional nature of the paparazzi’s relationship with

00:14:24.753 --> 00:14:30.453
Diana, as she lay dying in the wreckage of the car, instead of trying to help in some way

00:14:30.653 --> 00:14:36.693
or giving the paramedics the privacy to try to save her life, members of the press jumped

00:14:36.723 --> 00:14:42.313
onto the roof of the car and continued to take photos of the critically injured woman.

00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:48.353
It was the paparazzi that ultimately bore responsibility, so the argument goes.

00:14:49.093 --> 00:14:52.633
Henri Paul might have been drunk, but he wouldn’t have been

00:14:52.633 --> 00:14:57.143
driving so fast if the car wasn’t being pursued by the paparazzi.

00:14:58.573 --> 00:15:02.873
And this is not just a theory, it's not just someone’s argument.

00:15:03.613 --> 00:15:08.953
There was a lengthy official inquest into the death, which concluded that, and I’m

00:15:08.953 --> 00:15:15.163
quoting directly, “Diana was unlawfully killed by the grossly negligent driving of

00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:21.113
the following vehicles–meaning the paparazzi–and of the Mercedes driver Henri Paul".

00:15:22.453 --> 00:15:25.863
In other words, if she hadn’t been followed by the paparazzi,

00:15:26.223 --> 00:15:30.943
and if Henri Paul had been sober, she would still be alive today.

00:15:32.423 --> 00:15:38.833
And going one level further up, some lay the blame at the feet of the public, the

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:44.053
people who bought the newspapers and magazines that paid the paparazzi for their photos.

00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:52.163
A single picture of Diana could go for £500,000, more than a million Euros in today’s

00:15:52.163 --> 00:15:57.173
money, so it's hardly surprising that the paparazzi chased her so relentlessly.

00:15:57.633 --> 00:16:03.853
It is us, the public, who must bear some of the responsibility for endlessly buying the

00:16:03.853 --> 00:16:09.523
magazines with paparazzi pictures of Diana and for having such an insatiable appetite

00:16:09.779 --> 00:16:15.099
to consume every last detail and picture of the private life of someone who was a

00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:21.429
vulnerable and lonely woman struggling to repair her life after a nasty public divorce.

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:28.929
Now, it has been more than 25 years since the events of that fateful evening in Paris.

00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:33.489
Her sons have grown up, married and had children of their own.

00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:38.949
They both, reportedly, have a visceral hatred and distrust

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:42.619
of the press, especially the British tabloid press.

00:16:43.929 --> 00:16:44.869
And who can blame them?

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:51.799
The official verdict was that their mother’s death was unlawfully caused first by the paparazzi.

00:16:52.169 --> 00:16:55.339
Without the paparazzi, these two men would still have

00:16:55.339 --> 00:16:58.089
a mother, their children would have a grandmother.

00:16:59.438 --> 00:17:02.468
To wrap things up, perhaps the question to leave you with

00:17:02.768 --> 00:17:06.308
is to ask what has been learned from Diana’s tragic death?

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:10.328
It highlighted the dark side of fame and the extreme

00:17:10.328 --> 00:17:14.978
consequences of a relentless press, but did it change anything?

00:17:16.128 --> 00:17:20.248
More than 25 years later, her story still serves as a

00:17:20.308 --> 00:17:24.208
powerful reminder of the human cost behind the headlines.

00:17:26.448 --> 00:17:30.608
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Death of Princess Diana.

00:17:30.988 --> 00:17:34.028
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:39.468
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:17:39.918 --> 00:17:45.028

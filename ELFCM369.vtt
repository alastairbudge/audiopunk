Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.090
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.109
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.390
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.590
The Most Scandalous Headlines in British Tabloid History.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:35.790
In case you missed it, in the last episode we looked at the history of the British tabloids,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.339
and how a terrible scandal took down a popular tabloid called The News of The World.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.930
And in today’s episode we’re going to go a little deeper, and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.360
look at some of the most scandalous stories from British tabloids.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.499
On this journey we’ll look at the particular type of language used in

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.129
British tabloids, and learn about nationalism, sex scandals, xenophobia,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.950
royal gossip, and the political allegiances of the British tabloids.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.010
Before we start, I should say that if you haven’t listened to the last

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.449
episode yet, I would advise you to do that first, as a lot of what we’ll

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.600
talk about today will make a bit more sense if you have that background.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.260
OK, we’ve got a lot to get through, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.950
In 1982, as you may remember, two unlikely countries went to war.

00:01:34.019 --> 00:01:40.500
In fact, they didn’t actually go to war, as there was no formal declaration of war, but the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.860
10-week conflict cost the lives of 907 people, and is remembered in both countries as a “war”.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.769
If you’ve guessed it, well done.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.695
I’m talking about The Falklands War, Guerra de las

00:01:55.695 --> 00:02:00.085
Malvinas, the conflict between the UK and Argentina.

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:06.185
As you will no doubt know, the conflict is still highly sensitive, but

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:11.945
in this episode we’re going to try to conveniently sidestep, or avoid,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:15.645
Any discussion of  the rights and wrongs of the conflict.

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:19.915
This is because here we’re talking about the British tabloids.

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:25.075
But British tabloids do not avoid conflict, they do not deal in

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:30.415
nuance or subtlety, they do not shy away from offering their opinion.

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:38.745
And while most British newspapers, and the BBC, reported on the war in a neutral fashion,

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:45.225
talking about “British soldiers” and “Argentine soldiers”, one tabloid in particular

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:52.725
came out in full support of the war, using language like “our lads” to describe British

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:58.965
soldiers and “Argies”, as a shortened and offensive term for the Argentine army.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:06.835
This tabloid was The Sun, which you might remember from the last episode as one that also

00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:12.785
had a picture of a topless woman on Page 3 until it was pressured to remove it in 2015.

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:20.752
From the very start of the conflict, The Sun published headlines in support of the British soldiers,

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:27.222
even printing headlines like “We’ll Smash ‘Em” printed over a picture of Winston Churchill.

00:03:28.602 --> 00:03:33.682
The newspaper then launched a campaign selling stickers, claiming that the money

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:38.482
would be used to buy missiles that would be launched at the Argentinian navy.

00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:43.272
Fine, you might say, it’s to be expected that these more

00:03:43.272 --> 00:03:47.252
populist newspapers will come out in support of military action.

00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:50.932
After all, they are simply reflecting their readers'

00:03:50.942 --> 00:03:54.842
views, and the war was widely supported in Britain.

00:03:55.582 --> 00:04:01.392
But when the first casualties, the first deaths, were reported, some people

00:04:01.722 --> 00:04:07.272
expected or thought that the tabloids, and in particular The Sun, would

00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:12.622
tone it down slightly, they would adopt a more serious and respectful tone.

00:04:13.262 --> 00:04:15.842
After all, human lives were lost.

00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:19.042
How wrong they would be.

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:27.922
On May 4th, 1982, it was reported that a British submarine had sunk an Argentinian ship,

00:04:28.862 --> 00:04:36.562
and initial reports suggested that up to 1,200 Argentinian soldiers had been killed.

00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:42.482
The Sun did not mince its words, it was not respectful.

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:50.372
It's headline was simple: GOTCHA, which is a contraction of “got you”.

00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:56.392
Clearly, it lacked any sympathy for what was a horrific loss of

00:04:56.392 --> 00:05:01.612
life, and indeed it was very controversial, with subsequent editions

00:05:01.672 --> 00:05:07.272
of the newspaper having to be changed to “Did 1,200 Argies drown?”

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:16.012
It turned out however that this position, of undying support for the war and rejoicing in any

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:23.222
British military victory, was hugely profitable for The Sun, and it overtook its long-time rival,

00:05:23.402 --> 00:05:29.222
The Daily Mirror, selling more than a million copies more than The Daily Mirror every single day.

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:34.212
The Mirror, by the way, took an anti-war stance, an

00:05:34.442 --> 00:05:37.792
anti-war position which was terrible for business.

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:44.982
It turns out that patriotism and general anti-foreign rhetoric sold, they were

00:05:44.992 --> 00:05:50.252
real money spinners, and they still are a major theme for British tabloids.

00:05:51.322 --> 00:05:56.332
But the most common theme for British tabloids, something that you can probably find

00:05:56.332 --> 00:06:02.672
in every tabloid every single day, is a theme that you might be able to imagine or at

00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:07.852
least one that The Sun readers are confronted with as soon as they open the newspaper.

00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:09.602
Sex.

00:06:10.392 --> 00:06:16.422
And in particular, sex stories about celebrities doing things they shouldn’t be doing.

00:06:17.832 --> 00:06:21.902
There are countless examples of this, but one I want to talk about

00:06:21.912 --> 00:06:27.912
in particular involves the singer George Michael, who in 1998 was

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:33.332
arrested for a so-called “lewd act” in a public toilet in Los Angeles.

00:06:34.462 --> 00:06:38.412
“Lewd”, by the way, means offensive in a sexual way.

00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:46.242
And to translate this into plain English, to explain what happened, George Michael was followed

00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:52.042
into a public toilet by a man, a man who turned out to be a plain clothes police officer.

00:06:52.972 --> 00:06:57.902
George Michael thought the man was suggesting that they have sex, George

00:06:57.902 --> 00:07:03.532
Michael was interested in the idea, but when he started unzipping, opening,

00:07:03.532 --> 00:07:07.652
his trousers, the man revealed he was a policeman and arrested him.

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:13.942
George Michael was a very famous singer at the time, and it was

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:18.542
somewhat of an open secret that he was gay, that he was homosexual.

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:23.962
And being caught like this, this was exactly the kind of

00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:28.122
story that the British tabloids thrived on, that they loved.

00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:33.432
The story almost wrote itself, it was clearly going to be very popular.

00:07:34.442 --> 00:07:38.572
The only question now was how to create a catchy

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:41.632
headline, what should the headline of the story say?

00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:47.852
By this time British tabloids had developed a reputation for writing

00:07:48.102 --> 00:07:53.432
funny, catchy headlines, often involving puns or plays on words.

00:07:54.692 --> 00:07:59.702
And once the journalists at The Sun heard about this story, they got to work.

00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:04.192
So what did they come up with as a headline then?

00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:10.122
Well, when it comes to singers, headlines often use the names of their famous

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:14.372
songs,  and this was where they looked first in the case of this story.

00:08:15.582 --> 00:08:21.492
George Michael’s first number one hit was a song called “Wake Me Up Before You Go Go”.

00:08:22.332 --> 00:08:24.292
So what was the headline for this story?

00:08:25.162 --> 00:08:27.282
“Zip Me Up Before You Go Go”

00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:32.072
Zip, in case you didn’t know, is the device with sliding

00:08:32.092 --> 00:08:35.452
teeth that you open or close on a pair of trousers.

00:08:36.512 --> 00:08:37.382
Catchy, right?

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:46.348
Now, moving onto our third headline, another popular theme of the tabloids is anti-European feeling.

00:08:47.588 --> 00:08:52.358
As you will no doubt know, the UK has a mixed relationship with the rest

00:08:52.358 --> 00:08:57.221
of Europe - it never joined the Euro, Brits tend not to speak European

00:08:57.221 --> 00:09:01.301
languages, and of course the country voted to leave the European Union.

00:09:02.631 --> 00:09:06.841
And the rest of Europe, and in particular the European Union,

00:09:07.337 --> 00:09:11.881
were and still are frequent targets for the British tabloids.

00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:16.451
The two examples I want to give you here actually use

00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:20.481
the same headline format, but come 27 years apart.

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:26.351
And in fact, they are both again from The Sun, the tabloid behind

00:09:26.361 --> 00:09:29.711
the Falklands War headline and the George Michael headline.

00:09:31.631 --> 00:09:32.971
So, what’s the first one?

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:38.848
Well, in 1990, the President of the European Commission, the executive

00:09:38.858 --> 00:09:43.124
branch of the European Union, was a Frenchman called Jacques Delors,

00:09:43.538 --> 00:09:46.918
or “Jacques Delors” if you’re saying it with a British accent.

00:09:48.268 --> 00:09:54.478
The EU at this time was developing plans for a common currency, which The Sun thought

00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:59.707
was yet another example of the French trying to interfere in British business.

00:10:01.207 --> 00:10:06.147
In reaction to this, the tabloid published a story with the catchy headline

00:10:06.697 --> 00:10:12.157
“Up Yours Delors”, in which it gave its readers a long list of the problems

00:10:12.337 --> 00:10:16.727
that the French have caused people in Britain over the past thousand years.

00:10:17.757 --> 00:10:23.667
Now, this term, “Up Yours” is worth expanding on a little bit, because even though you

00:10:23.677 --> 00:10:28.797
know what “up” and “yours” mean, you might not know what they mean when put together.

00:10:29.657 --> 00:10:35.947
It’s an insult, essentially, and is short for “shove it up your arse”, “put it up your bottom”.

00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:41.157
So, there you go, a British newspaper telling the president of

00:10:41.157 --> 00:10:45.017
the European Commission to put his single currency up his bottom.

00:10:46.617 --> 00:10:52.307
And The Sun, yes The Sun again, would go on to do something even worse, or

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:57.907
insult even more people, 27 years later, during the Brexit negotiations.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.950
Specifically, there were the negotiations about what would happen to

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.430
Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory and tiny rock to the south of Spain.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:15.070
The Sun, as you might be able to guess by now, was fiercely in support of

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.690
Gibraltar keeping its British connections, and not going it back to Spain.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.900
So, what did the headline say?

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.760
Well, it used the same format as back in 1990 with Jacques Delors.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:36.970
This time the headline went “Up Yours Senors” - “senor”, in case you weren’t aware, is the Spanish

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:44.190
word for Mr, and with this headline the paper was insulting the entire population of Spain.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:50.680
Now, with the exception of the story about the Falklands War, you might

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:56.170
say that these headlines are a bit of harmless fun, a way of making a bit

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.120
of a joke about current affairs, to sensationalise the news a little bit.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:09.100
But now I’d like to highlight a few occasions where the true power of many of the tabloids shines

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:15.650
through, and where the political biases of the newspapers, and their owners, is clear to see.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:21.544
The first thing to state is that having the support specifically of

00:12:21.544 --> 00:12:26.294
the tabloids is a hugely important thing for a British political party.

00:12:27.184 --> 00:12:31.744
They are the most popular newspapers by circulation, and they make

00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:35.340
their political views abundantly clear to their their readers.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.430
Some tabloids always have the same political leanings, they stick with

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:46.434
the same political party - The Mirror has supported The Labour Party since

00:12:46.434 --> 00:12:52.134
1945, and The Daily Mail has almost always supported The Conservatives.

00:12:53.664 --> 00:12:59.264
The Sun, on the other hand, has switched sides several times, initially

00:12:59.264 --> 00:13:04.764
being a right-leaning newspaper, then supporting the Labour Party in 1997

00:13:04.874 --> 00:13:09.638
with Tony Blair, and then switching back   to The Conservatives in 2010.

00:13:11.178 --> 00:13:19.098
And during the general election in April of 1992, most surveys, most polls, suggested that

00:13:19.108 --> 00:13:24.698
the Labour Party would win, and that a man called Neil Kinnock would become Prime Minister.

00:13:26.158 --> 00:13:30.588
The Sun newspaper, which, remember, was Conservative-supporting

00:13:30.618 --> 00:13:34.128
at the time, was not particularly enthusiastic about this.

00:13:35.668 --> 00:13:39.638
Its three and a half million daily readers picked up their copy of the

00:13:39.638 --> 00:13:44.568
newspaper on the morning of the election and saw the headline “ If Kinnock

00:13:44.608 --> 00:13:49.673
wins today will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights.”

00:13:51.293 --> 00:13:55.343
As in, if the Labour party wins, everyone should leave

00:13:55.353 --> 00:13:58.573
the country because it will be such terrible news.

00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:03.863
If you’re thinking, hang on, I don’t remember Neil Kinnock and

00:14:04.063 --> 00:14:08.743
wasn’t John Major Prime Minister around then, then you’d be right.

00:14:09.673 --> 00:14:14.143
Neil Kinnock lost, to the surprise of many commentators.

00:14:15.453 --> 00:14:19.943
Did The Sun swing the election in the favour of The Conservatives?

00:14:21.053 --> 00:14:26.153
Who knows, but it was the most popular newspaper in the country at the time,

00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:31.563
making its way into one in seven households at the time of the general election.

00:14:32.953 --> 00:14:38.943
It was a powerful force indeed, and whether it swung the election in the Conservatives favour

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:45.743
or not, it was a very strong message that no doubt made some of its readers change their mind.

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:52.913
Fast forward 20 years, and the tabloids were prepared to get even more personal

00:14:53.043 --> 00:14:56.594
with their political attacks  in the run-up to another general election.

00:14:57.894 --> 00:15:02.344
And this time we’re talking about The Daily Mail, a paper which has

00:15:02.344 --> 00:15:06.274
been staunchly supportive of The Conservatives throughout its history.

00:15:07.394 --> 00:15:13.394
An election was coming, and The Daily Mail had been publishing anti-Labour stories most days.

00:15:14.694 --> 00:15:19.474
In 2013, a year and a half before the election, The Daily

00:15:19.474 --> 00:15:22.724
Mail published its biggest attack on the Labour Party.

00:15:24.144 --> 00:15:29.574
But it wasn’t on the party in general, or against its leader, Ed Milliband.

00:15:30.704 --> 00:15:37.576
It was against his father, a man called Ralph Milliband, who had died 20 years beforehand.

00:15:39.016 --> 00:15:45.216
The headline read: “The man who hated Britain”, and the story described

00:15:45.406 --> 00:15:51.206
how Ed Milliband’s father hated Britain and that his son, the leader of

00:15:51.206 --> 00:15:56.166
the Labour Party, wanted to bring back socialism to honour his dead father.

00:15:57.766 --> 00:16:02.806
To many, this was repulsive - the paper was attacking the dead

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:07.036
father of a politician for nothing other than his political beliefs.

00:16:08.106 --> 00:16:12.916
But it worked, or at least, Ed Milliband lost the election,

00:16:13.396 --> 00:16:17.092
and The Daily Mail sold millions of copies in the meantime.

00:16:18.506 --> 00:16:23.946
And our final theme of scandalous tabloid headlines is one that, for some

00:16:23.976 --> 00:16:28.786
tabloids at least, has been an almost constant source of news stories and scandal.

00:16:30.306 --> 00:16:32.656
And this is the Royal Family.

00:16:33.586 --> 00:16:39.286
Now, starting with Prince Charles and Diana in the early 1980s, then the divorce,

00:16:39.646 --> 00:16:43.926
the death of Diana, and now the scandal surrounding Prince Harry and Meghan

00:16:43.926 --> 00:16:49.152
Markle, the Royal Family has provided plenty of material for the tabloids.

00:16:50.482 --> 00:16:56.079
If you remember from the last episode, Prince Harry called them “ the devil”, blamed

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:00.989
them for his mother’s death and for their constant attacks on his own wife, Meghan.

00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.789
Why?

00:17:03.409 --> 00:17:06.469
Well, there are almost too many stories to choose from.

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:13.529
A British tabloid called The People published an intimate phone call between Prince Charles

00:17:13.529 --> 00:17:19.451
and Camilla, multiple tabloids published photos of a man sucking the toes of Prince Andrew’s

00:17:19.451 --> 00:17:25.851
wife, and Princess Diana was followed everywhere by the tabloid press when she was alive.

00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:33.621
Indeed, to illustrate the hypocrisy of one particular tabloid, one called The Daily

00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:39.511
Express, it published an article shortly before Diana’s death calling for her to

00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:46.411
“stay out of politics”, to stop interfering, yet in the 25 years since her death

00:17:46.741 --> 00:17:51.681
there has barely been a week since it has published some kind of story about Diana.

00:17:53.207 --> 00:17:59.177
So, there it is telling her to stop talking to journalists, yet this newspaper has

00:17:59.187 --> 00:18:04.587
likely made tens, hundreds of millions of pounds since then printing stories about her,

00:18:05.127 --> 00:18:10.987
despite her having died several decades ago and clearly there not being any real “news”.

00:18:12.287 --> 00:18:17.117
Now, it’s very easy to point fingers at the British tabloids and

00:18:17.327 --> 00:18:20.627
suggest that they are responsible for all manner of bad things.

00:18:21.547 --> 00:18:25.287
But, of course, journalists only investigate and write

00:18:25.287 --> 00:18:27.707
these stories because they know people will read them.

00:18:28.627 --> 00:18:33.967
And in Britain, like all over the world, scandal sells.

00:18:34.657 --> 00:18:40.227
People want to read stories about sex and gossip, they want news embellished

00:18:40.247 --> 00:18:45.967
and made more exciting, they want to read stories about humans not statistics,

00:18:46.247 --> 00:18:51.927
and they want to see their own opinion reflected back at them in a news article.

00:18:53.217 --> 00:18:59.097
Other newspapers might complain about this, they might stamp their feet and write opinion pieces

00:18:59.107 --> 00:19:05.577
about journalistic standards, and protest that tabloid journalists aren’t “real” journalists.

00:19:06.557 --> 00:19:12.717
But one thing is undeniable: whether it’s The Sun, The Daily Mail or The Mirror,

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:18.921
British tabloids have decades of experience in writing catchy headlines, reporting

00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:25.111
on sex, scandals and gossip, and delivering exactly what their readers want to read.

00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:30.011
And at the end of the day, the numbers speak for themselves.

00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:34.587
The British tabloids certainly know how to sell newspapers.

00:19:37.127 --> 00:19:42.957
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Most Scandalous Headlines in British Tabloid History.

00:19:43.617 --> 00:19:48.327
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that this was an interesting follow-up, that

00:19:48.327 --> 00:19:52.897
it shone a bit of light on what you’d actually see if you picked up a copy of The Sun.

00:19:53.937 --> 00:19:57.157
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:57.547 --> 00:20:00.437
How are tabloids different in your country?

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:07.117
If you live in a country with a royal family, are they the subject of such scandal and intrigue?

00:20:07.967 --> 00:20:10.597
Who do your tabloids normally take aim at?

00:20:11.497 --> 00:20:14.837
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

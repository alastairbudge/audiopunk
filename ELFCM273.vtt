Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.537 --> 00:00:16.807
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:20.977
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.927 --> 00:00:25.257
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is going to be the start

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:29.767
of another three-part mini-series, this time on fashion.

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:37.087
In this episode, part one, we’ll take a look at some of the curiosities of fashion through history.

00:00:37.597 --> 00:00:43.337
We’ll touch on fashion through the ages, ask ourselves some fundamental questions about

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:49.747
why people wear what they wear, consider how this is different now compared to the past,

00:00:49.747 --> 00:00:55.217
and we’ll look at several very peculiar choices that were highly fashionable at the time.

00:00:55.817 --> 00:01:00.437
Then in part two we’ll look at the growth of high fashion, and the

00:01:00.437 --> 00:01:04.847
great fashion houses of the 20th century, of course talking about

00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:10.547
names you’ll be familiar with such as Chanel, Gucci, Dior, and Versace.

00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:17.447
And in part three we’ll look at modern fashion, specifically “fast fashion”, and

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:23.977
discuss how this change in fashion is affecting society, fashion, and the environment.

00:01:25.467 --> 00:01:27.467
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:32.257
And let me start this episode, and this mini-series

00:01:32.507 --> 00:01:35.797
with what might seem like some provocative questions.

00:01:36.657 --> 00:01:38.017
What are you wearing?

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.867
And why did you choose to wear it?

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:44.447
Do you consider yourself to be a fashionable person?

00:01:45.297 --> 00:01:48.857
How are the clothes that you are wearing now different from

00:01:48.857 --> 00:01:53.867
the clothes that you wore 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago?

00:01:54.427 --> 00:02:00.927
And what sort of clothes do you think you might be wearing 10, 20, or 50 years from now?

00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:07.877
Even for those of us who would not claim to be great followers of the latest fashions

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:13.917
or trends, we are all influenced, to a certain degree, by our cultural settings, by

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:19.867
what is considered to be cool and appropriate, by what is considered to be fashionable.

00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:26.387
So, in this episode we are going to look at some of the curiosities of fashion through the ages.

00:02:27.007 --> 00:02:30.477
To begin with, we’ll look at a couple of examples of how

00:02:30.677 --> 00:02:35.867
historical events have changed fashions almost overnight, and why.

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:39.457
Then we’ll look at women’s fashion in particular, and

00:02:39.477 --> 00:02:42.737
look at the journey to “liberate” women’s fashion.

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:49.227
And to conclude, in case you will need some further evidence that fashion is just a very

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:56.277
strange subject, we’ll look at five unique examples of very unusual fashions through the ages.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:01.547
And this is evidently a vast and complicated topic, we’ll have to treat

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:06.257
some of these subjects with broad brush strokes, so you will forgive

00:03:06.277 --> 00:03:10.537
some simplifications, but I hope it’ll be interesting nonetheless.

00:03:11.777 --> 00:03:16.867
Right then, let me start with something that you might accuse, unless you’re a naturist, that

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:23.057
is, of being a truism, of being something so obviously true that there’s no point in saying it.

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.217
Wearing clothes is a good thing.

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:30.517
Clothes keep you warm when it’s cold, they block out the

00:03:30.517 --> 00:03:34.437
sun when it’s too hot, they protect you from rough surfaces.

00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:41.597
And apart from these very sensible practical reasons for wearing clothes, clothes have an

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:48.497
excellent social function too, as it’s unacceptable to be naked in public in most modern societies.

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:55.587
The clothes we wear also identify us as parts of particular groups or social classes.

00:03:55.897 --> 00:03:59.727
A queen might wear a crown, a businessman might wear a

00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:03.827
suit and tie, a judge might wear a wig with white hair.

00:04:04.537 --> 00:04:07.467
And this has been the case throughout history.

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:12.427
Anthropologists estimate that we’ve been wearing clothes for anywhere from

00:04:12.657 --> 00:04:18.967
100,000 to 500,000 years, that’s half a million years of human history.

00:04:19.678 --> 00:04:24.842
Going right back to the earliest discoveries of clothing, it’s clear that humans

00:04:24.852 --> 00:04:30.402
have taken some pride in their physical appearance, making jewellery, embroidered

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:36.402
clothes, and so on, and using clothes to show style and status in society.

00:04:37.552 --> 00:04:42.852
Evidently, if you were an agricultural labourer in Ancient Greece you wouldn't

00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:46.922
have spent too much time worrying about what clothes you were going to wear in the

00:04:46.922 --> 00:04:52.818
morning, nor would a Scottish sheep farmer tending his flock in the 12th century.

00:04:53.858 --> 00:04:59.698
This didn’t mean that fashion didn’t exist for these people, but rather that spending too much

00:04:59.698 --> 00:05:06.128
time or money thinking about your clothes was something that was typically restricted to those with

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:12.488
the financial ability to do it, those at the top of society, who were of course in the minority.

00:05:13.488 --> 00:05:17.548
But it was typically from here, from those at the top of society,

00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:21.608
that the ideas about what was or wasn’t fashionable would come.

00:05:22.258 --> 00:05:27.462
Sometimes fashions would be imported from abroad, when visitors from another

00:05:27.462 --> 00:05:32.282
country would arrive and the style of their clothing would be considered desirable.

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:37.542
Sometimes it would be after a particular royal, a member of the

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:41.612
royal family, wore a particular style, and everyone would follow.

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:49.132
And in other cases, fashion would change after huge, seismic political or societal

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:53.892
changes, and we are going to look at two of these cases to begin our journey.

00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:59.152
Let’s start in the world of 17th-century England.

00:05:59.912 --> 00:06:04.702
If you have listened to episode number 232, on when Britain

00:06:04.732 --> 00:06:08.162
killed its king, this period will be familiar to you.

00:06:09.002 --> 00:06:13.062
I’m talking about the time in England when there was no monarch and

00:06:13.062 --> 00:06:17.642
when the country was ruled by a man named Oliver Cromwell and his fellow

00:06:17.932 --> 00:06:23.332
puritans, a Protestant Christian group that arose in the late 16th century.

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:28.692
As you may remember, this radical religious group thought

00:06:28.772 --> 00:06:32.652
that pleasure was inherently sinful, that it was bad.

00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:39.182
So, it was therefore a logical next step to see all forms of display,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:44.532
such as colourful and extravagant clothes, as bad in themselves.

00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:50.822
In short, ornaments, jewellery and anything superfluous, anything

00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:55.992
unnecessary, were forbidden: utility and the practical dominated.

00:06:56.662 --> 00:07:01.352
Colours were banished and the effect was monochrome – black and white.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:07.302
If you have ever seen a picture of Oliver Cromwell, the leader of England at this

00:07:07.312 --> 00:07:13.332
time, he is almost always depicted in black and white, and never smiling, of course.

00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:18.522
When the English Commonwealth, or Protectorate as it was known,

00:07:18.612 --> 00:07:24.032
fell and the king returned in 1660, back came colour and display.

00:07:25.022 --> 00:07:31.502
Women of fine society, in other words wealthy, urban women, wore expensive and

00:07:31.512 --> 00:07:36.772
elaborate dresses, often with additional wigs worn on top of their own hair.

00:07:37.642 --> 00:07:40.002
And wigs weren’t confined to women.

00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:45.692
Men started to wear expensive white and powdered wigs, beauty spots,

00:07:46.022 --> 00:07:50.182
lavish, highly embroidered jackets and heavily decorated shoes.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:55.359
This was the time of extravagant fashions and equally loose morals.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:08:02.669
Almost overnight, the country cast off the constraints of puritan living, and, led by

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:08.839
the famously fun-loving king, Charles II, a man known as The Merry Monarch, a party

00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:15.359
atmosphere and extravagant fashions returned, ending the 11 year period of black and white.

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:21.449
Our next fashion change features an event of much more seismic or

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:26.759
volcanic proportions - the French Revolution, which began in 1789.

00:08:27.709 --> 00:08:31.889
The fashion styles of the extravagant court of France‘s final king,

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:36.659
Louis XVI will be familiar to you, and there are many similarities

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.569
with the style in England that came back with the return of Charles II.

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:46.099
Wigs, lavishly embroidered and colourful three-quarter coats for

00:08:46.099 --> 00:08:49.869
men were the order of the day at the royal court in Versailles.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.858
Women wore similarly extravagant dresses, complete with especially distinctive

00:08:56.118 --> 00:09:01.118
so-called “panniers“, meaning baskets in English, which were skirts

00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:06.098
which became ridiculously wide at the waist, almost looking like tables.

00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:13.248
These bulky baskets were created through the use of whalebone, metal and reeds.

00:09:13.818 --> 00:09:18.358
They made a kind of cage over which the expensive dress would sit.

00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:25.241
This fashion, which like many fashions migrated across the English Channel, was

00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:30.851
mocked in an article in The Gentleman‘s Magazine in 1750, with one frustrated

00:09:30.851 --> 00:09:35.841
lady writing, “The whole side of a coach is hardly spacious enough for one of us,”

00:09:37.121 --> 00:09:41.481
As you will remember, The French Revolution brought with it a throwing

00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:46.901
off of old ideas, and fashion was no exception to this dramatic shift.

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:52.051
So, out with the decadent emblems of the failed aristocracy.

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:58.561
In with clothes which demonstrated the new spirit of liberation and human potential.

00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:06.071
Probably the most famous example of this was the “sans culottes”, the style of not wearing

00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:12.561
tight breeches that the aristocracy would wear, but instead wearing loose-fitting trousers.

00:10:13.451 --> 00:10:17.721
The term “sans culottes” literally became the name for the group of

00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:22.991
people, the common, working people, and is one of the most notable times

00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:27.941
that a group of society became named after a particular fashion choice.

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:34.791
But another particularly important demonstration or manifestation was in women‘s

00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:40.921
clothing – the so-called Empire dress, otherwise known as the Empire silhouette.

00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:48.621
If you think back to any European works of art, or even TV shows or films from

00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:53.401
the early 19th century, this was the predominant style of dress for women.

00:10:54.251 --> 00:10:58.531
It was typically white, made of a light cloth, tight

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:01.591
under the breast, and then loose all the way down.

00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:06.971
It was quite the opposite of the large, pannier style dresses that came

00:11:06.971 --> 00:11:12.981
directly before the revolution, and symbolised a more free, more egalitarian

00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:19.041
society, one where displays of luxury were, at least initially, frowned upon.

00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:25.991
But the Empire dress didn’t last for particularly long, and by the mid 19th century,

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:32.111
at least in Britain, women were forced back into tighter and less comfortable clothing.

00:11:32.611 --> 00:11:39.021
And this leads us on to our next section, which is actually a brief exploration of how

00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:45.511
changes in society led to changes in women’s clothing in a period of only 100 years or so.

00:11:46.731 --> 00:11:51.621
We’ll focus on England here, but you may well notice some similarities

00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:55.281
with fashions in your country, especially if you’re from Europe.

00:11:56.551 --> 00:12:02.641
By the 1820s or so, the more comfortable Empire Dress was no longer in fashion.

00:12:03.481 --> 00:12:07.891
Corsets, the tightly fitting hard undergarments, that pulled

00:12:07.951 --> 00:12:11.201
everything in and made it difficult to breathe, were back.

00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:18.431
The dresses that would be worn over the corset tended to be heavy duty, and there would

00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:23.611
be things called “bustles” that were tucked into the dress, just behind the bottom.

00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:29.831
These bustles were basically cushions, and created the strange look

00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:34.281
of a woman who was often leaning over with a very large bottom.

00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:40.091
What’s more, these dresses would often have wide hoops around the

00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:45.521
bottom, pushing them out, in effect turning the dress into a steel cage.

00:12:46.541 --> 00:12:49.191
The technical term for this was a Crinoline.

00:12:49.891 --> 00:12:54.771
I imagine you will have seen pictures of these, but if you haven’t, imagine

00:12:54.801 --> 00:13:01.151
a dress that is pushed out by a large cage, creating a sort of cone shape,

00:13:01.401 --> 00:13:06.561
and making it practically impossible for the wearer to do anything active in.

00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:09.487
And that was partially the point.

00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:16.937
Society in Victorian England suggested that the right way for a woman to behave was to sit

00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:23.117
around and listen, often to the man, or to the older lady, who was telling her what to do.

00:13:23.957 --> 00:13:26.797
It didn’t matter that the woman couldn’t really move

00:13:26.827 --> 00:13:29.927
because she wasn't supposed to be doing much moving.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:36.657
In fashion terms, things started to change in the final decade of the 19th

00:13:36.687 --> 00:13:41.757
century with, again, Parisian influences spreading across Western Europe

00:13:42.147 --> 00:13:46.667
with the so-called era of the Belle Époque or literally beautiful time.

00:13:48.087 --> 00:13:52.777
For women the gains were greatest because they had been kept in incredibly

00:13:52.817 --> 00:13:57.707
uncomfortable and impractical clothes for the majority of the 19th century.

00:13:58.597 --> 00:14:04.237
The increasing popularity and social acceptability of sporting activities,

00:14:04.557 --> 00:14:09.197
especially for women, was to be an important factor in changing fashions.

00:14:10.177 --> 00:14:15.387
These relatively liberated pastimes required suitable clothing; you couldn’t

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:20.747
run around wearing a steel cage, and so the concept of “sportswear” was born.

00:14:21.807 --> 00:14:26.777
Finally there was some liberation from the tight-fitting and completely

00:14:26.867 --> 00:14:32.347
impractical clothing of the 19th century, and this paved the way for much of

00:14:32.347 --> 00:14:36.027
the more comfortable clothing that became fashionable in the 20th century.

00:14:36.997 --> 00:14:42.647
There is obviously a whole lot more to say about the changes in women’s fashion since then, but this

00:14:42.657 --> 00:14:49.377
brief look is simply intended to give you some idea of how changing attitudes to what women should

00:14:49.537 --> 00:14:55.657
or shouldn’t do led to differences in what was and wasn’t acceptable in terms of women’s fashion.

00:14:56.777 --> 00:15:03.717
Now to the final stage of the episode – five of the strangest fashion curiosities across the ages.

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:09.752
First of all, let us go back to Krakow in Poland and to the year 1340.

00:15:10.737 --> 00:15:15.197
Here in the Polish royal court arose a bizarre fashion for

00:15:15.197 --> 00:15:19.647
men’s shoes that were absurdly long and thin or - pointy.

00:15:20.687 --> 00:15:26.517
The name for these shoes was Krakows or poulaines, meaning in the Polish fashion.

00:15:27.717 --> 00:15:34.147
These shoes were so impractical that the wearer sometimes had to add a chain which

00:15:34.147 --> 00:15:39.247
went from the shoe to his knee, so allowing him to walk without too much difficulty.

00:15:40.827 --> 00:15:44.547
This fashion spread across Europe and can be seen in many

00:15:44.577 --> 00:15:47.697
paintings of the time and for many decades afterwards.

00:15:48.687 --> 00:15:54.197
Interestingly, in the same way that fashions throughout the ages have caused controversy and

00:15:54.407 --> 00:16:01.607
annoyed established powers, so these shoes were condemned by the Church as “devil‘s fingers”, with

00:16:01.607 --> 00:16:07.507
one church official complaining that men couldn’t kneel to pray because the shoes were too pointy.

00:16:08.387 --> 00:16:11.767
Now you might have thought that these shoes were a thing of the

00:16:11.767 --> 00:16:16.557
past, but similar kinds of shoes were very popular in the UK in the

00:16:16.557 --> 00:16:21.437
1950s, after being popularised by a group called the “Teddy Boys”.

00:16:22.707 --> 00:16:27.997
As you can see with the overly long and pointy shoes, having clothes that were far

00:16:27.997 --> 00:16:33.687
too big for you, thereby demonstrating that you had enough money to buy superfluous

00:16:33.687 --> 00:16:39.417
or unnecessary stuff, was clearly a way of displaying your social status and wealth.

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:45.157
You can see a similar idea during the Middle Ages in the Venetian fashion

00:16:45.187 --> 00:16:50.357
of “Dogalina“ sleeves – sleeves so long that they reached the woman‘s knee.

00:16:51.447 --> 00:16:55.517
Again, although to the modern eye the sleeves might look absurd,

00:16:55.737 --> 00:17:00.627
the demonstration of excess was evidence of your wealth and status.

00:17:01.217 --> 00:17:06.677
Who knows, in years to come perhaps the practice of paying more for a pair of jeans

00:17:06.837 --> 00:17:11.497
that are ripped, that have holes in them, might seem equally strange to our descendents.

00:17:13.057 --> 00:17:17.247
Our next stop is with a distinctive and, again, bizarre

00:17:17.247 --> 00:17:21.357
fashion trend, in this case something that is exclusively male.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:28.027
You may be guessing what I am about to talk about – yes, the male codpiece, worn

00:17:28.027 --> 00:17:34.327
famously by 16th century monarchs, such as Phillip II of Spain and Henry VIII of England.

00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:40.945
A codpiece is the hard piece of material worn over the male genitalia.

00:17:41.527 --> 00:17:47.477
Going back to 14th century Europe, the fashion of the time was for men was to wear tight

00:17:47.547 --> 00:17:53.447
trousers that fitted very closely to the skin, leaving very little to the imagination.

00:17:54.217 --> 00:17:58.167
There was therefore the awkward issue of how the male

00:17:58.367 --> 00:18:02.287
genital area was dealt with, and the codpiece was born.

00:18:03.397 --> 00:18:07.547
Over time, these codpieces became bigger and bigger, with the

00:18:07.597 --> 00:18:11.687
intention being that the eyes were drawn to the size of the codpiece.

00:18:12.707 --> 00:18:19.637
It’s easy to think it ridiculous with the benefit of hindsight, but for the majority of the 16th

00:18:19.657 --> 00:18:26.657
century men of high status would wander around with these very large boxes under their trousers.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.410
It’s even stranger when you think that the original idea behind the

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:36.670
codpiece was hiding the genitalia, and in fact it changed into a tool

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.100
to draw attention to it, but fashion is strange and unpredictable.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.500
Now, moving on to our fourth and penultimate example.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:51.820
Wigs, as we have seen, have been a feature of fashion display at various points in history.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.811
Men‘s wigs have been a relative rarity, so it is interesting to note

00:18:57.831 --> 00:19:05.400
the odd, if brief, fashion of the 1760s and 1770s for an outrageous head

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:10.090
display worn by a particular type of Englishman called the “macaroni”.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:17.310
And no, I do not mean the famous Italian pasta of that name, but the nickname for a type

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:23.930
of male English aristocrat who wore a large wig topped with a small feather or a hat.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.540
This distinctive and lavish fashion is said to have been imported back to

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:36.570
England in the early 1760s by aristocrats returning from the Grand Tours of

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:41.680
Europe, having observed the fashion during their tours of foreign capitals.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.830
These young men developed this strange fashion, as well as a taste for the pasta

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:53.090
called macaroni, and when they returned to England they called themselves Macaroni.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:59.400
And on a related note, you may know the children’s nursery rhyme, Yankee Doodle.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.720
In this nursery rhyme there are the lyrics:

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.560
Yankee Doodle went to town

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.970
A-riding on a pony,

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:07.830
Stuck a feather in his cap

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.450
And called it macaroni.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:15.580
It was actually a song written by the British to make fun of unstylish and

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:20.330
uncultured Americans who thought they could just put a feather in their hat

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.660
and be a “macaroni”, thinking that anyone could buy style and high fashion.

00:20:26.162 --> 00:20:30.402
And strangely enough nowadays this song is treated as a sort of

00:20:31.012 --> 00:20:35.272
patriotic song by Americans, but its origin is very different.

00:20:36.502 --> 00:20:41.852
And our final unusual fashion trend for today’s episode brings together a monarch,

00:20:42.222 --> 00:20:47.222
sweets, showing your wealth, and something that is just clearly a bad idea.

00:20:48.482 --> 00:20:53.112
In Elizabethan England, in the late 16th century, sugar was

00:20:53.112 --> 00:20:56.672
still a luxury that only the richest in society could afford.

00:20:57.652 --> 00:21:01.362
The richest person in Elizabethan society was, of course,

00:21:01.592 --> 00:21:04.692
Queen Elizabeth, and she loved the taste of sugar.

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:10.122
She loved it so much, in fact, that her teeth turned black and rotten.

00:21:11.072 --> 00:21:15.722
In an attempt to copy the queen and show that they too were rich enough to

00:21:15.722 --> 00:21:21.632
afford sugar, women in high society England started to colour their teeth black.

00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:25.844
I’m not sure that this would be considered attractive by many modern

00:21:25.844 --> 00:21:30.454
standards, but having said that, perhaps people will look back in 500

00:21:30.464 --> 00:21:34.854
years to the fashion of having gold teeth and think a similar thing.

00:21:35.484 --> 00:21:36.094
Who knows?

00:21:36.524 --> 00:21:39.614
And that is one of the many strange things about fashion.

00:21:40.354 --> 00:21:44.174
What seems completely normal, and indeed “fashionable”

00:21:44.354 --> 00:21:48.054
at one point in time seems utterly bizarre years later.

00:21:49.204 --> 00:21:53.244
No matter whether you are 20 years old, 40 years old or 80 years

00:21:53.244 --> 00:21:57.694
old, or anywhere in between, you probably look back at pictures of

00:21:57.694 --> 00:22:01.584
your parents and think that they used to wear very strange clothes.

00:22:02.634 --> 00:22:07.404
And going back to the very first question I asked you right at the start of the episode.

00:22:07.714 --> 00:22:08.974
What are you wearing now?

00:22:09.834 --> 00:22:13.394
You probably think it’s completely normal, nothing strange at all.

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:18.284
Of course, by most modern standards, it probably isn’t, as long as you

00:22:18.284 --> 00:22:23.024
are not wearing a codpiece or very pointy shoes, it’s normal for now.

00:22:23.505 --> 00:22:27.676
But in decades and centuries to come, if history is anything

00:22:27.676 --> 00:22:31.426
to go by, it might be considered very strange indeed.

00:22:33.356 --> 00:22:39.466
OK then, that is it for this brief look at the curiosities of fashion throughout history.

00:22:39.856 --> 00:22:45.016
It’s a huge topic to cover, but I hope that this little dip into it has been interesting,

00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:49.376
and perhaps it’s made you think about what you’re wearing in a slightly different way.

00:22:50.506 --> 00:22:55.846
As a reminder, this is part one of a little three-part series on fashion.

00:22:56.266 --> 00:23:00.146
Next up we’ll look at the arrival of the great fashion houses of the

00:23:00.146 --> 00:23:04.946
20th century, then it’ll be an exploration of the world of fast fashion.

00:23:05.816 --> 00:23:09.116
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:23:09.486 --> 00:23:12.826
What do you think causes things to go in and out of fashion?

00:23:13.104 --> 00:23:16.256
What are some of the most unusual fashions that you’re aware of?

00:23:16.896 --> 00:23:21.756
What modern fashion do you think people will look back on with most amusement?

00:23:22.536 --> 00:23:25.826
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

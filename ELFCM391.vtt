Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:16.366
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:20.566
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:24.056
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:27.206
talking about something called “The British Invasion”.

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:32.996
It was the period in the 1960s when British bands like The Beatles and

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:36.726
The Rolling Stones arrived in America, changing the country’s musical

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:41.616
scene, and leaving a legacy that would last, well, to this very day.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:46.646
It’s a fascinating story, the story of how British rock bands

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:51.326
came to pack such a powerful punch, so let’s get right into it.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:59.566
February 9th, 1964, was in many ways a Sunday like any other.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:04.013
Tens of millions of Americans sat down in front of their

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:08.326
television sets, ready for an evening of light entertainment.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:13.996
One of the most popular shows of the time was the Ed Sullivan

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:20.193
Show, a family-friendly programme which ran from 1948 to 1971.

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:26.266
That evening's show, however, would be unlike any other.

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:33.036
For this show, the producers had booked four young men from Liverpool.

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:39.546
Their names were Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.416
They were, of course, The Beatles.

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:47.726
As the young men took the stage, with their dark hair and

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:53.216
dark suits, the crowd erupted into shrieks and wild applause.

00:01:54.306 --> 00:01:58.366
Only 728 tickets for the show had been made publicly

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:02.566
available, and there had been more than 50,000 requests.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:13.896
A record breaking 73 million people, that's 34% of the entire US population, watched it on live TV.

00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:20.026
And according to one anecdote, during the time that The Beatles were live on

00:02:20.026 --> 00:02:25.336
The Ed Sullivan Show, not a single crime would be reported in New York City.

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:30.906
That evening would kickstart what would come to be called “The British

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:35.816
Invasion”, the domination of US musical culture by British groups,

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:41.156
a domination that would go on for the best part of three decades.

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:49.566
So, what happened, how did it get to this point, and what was the lasting legacy of this “invasion”?

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:52.436
Well, first, some background.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:57.016
In terms of what was going on economically and culturally in Britain,

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:03.556
as you may know, the post-war period was one characterised by struggle.

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:08.966
Rationing, the government-imposed limiting of foods and other

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:14.536
goods, only ended in 1954, almost 10 years after the end of the war.

00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:19.186
Britain was not a rich country; there was high unemployment,

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:22.996
wage stagnation, life was not great for most people.

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:28.426
Across the pond, in the United States, the recovery had been much

00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:32.996
quicker, and the United States had experienced an economic boom.

00:03:33.756 --> 00:03:38.766
With this came a new generation of singers and musicians, people like Elvis

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:42.966
Presley, who you can learn all about in episode number 228 by the way.

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:48.416
The US was the musical centre of the world, and young

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.576
British people looked to America for inspiration.

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:59.086
On a practical level, the US was also where the best instruments and recording technology were

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:05.246
being made, so if you wanted to make great sounding music, American equipment was what you needed.

00:04:06.606 --> 00:04:14.036
Try as they might, young British musicians couldn’t really recreate the American sound.

00:04:14.906 --> 00:04:19.386
The UK didn’t have the same cultural influences as the US.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:24.816
There wasn’t blues or country music; Brits and Americans might speak the

00:04:24.816 --> 00:04:30.096
same language, but the underlying cultural differences were significant.

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:33.126
So, what happened?

00:04:33.866 --> 00:04:38.766
Well, there was one American musical genre that young British musicians

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:44.106
embraced almost as their own, giving it its own new lease of life.

00:04:45.096 --> 00:04:47.536
This was a type of music called “skiffle”.

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:51.146
It’s a kind of folk music that originated in the

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:55.266
United States, but was adopted by Brits in the 1950s.

00:04:56.466 --> 00:05:01.916
It only really required guitars and singing, so it was quite easy and cheap to

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:06.626
make, which was important in a country that was still very much in recovery mode.

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:11.876
One early skiffle band was called The Quarrymen.

00:05:12.466 --> 00:05:17.066
Now, unless you are a serious connoisseur of this period, you might not have

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:21.826
heard of this band, but you’ll probably see where I’m going when I tell you

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:28.606
that the founder of this band was a teenager called John Lennon, who in 1956

00:05:28.826 --> 00:05:33.936
recruited his friends Paul McCartney and George Harrison to join the band with him.

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:38.846
Yes, The Quarrymen was the band that turned into The Beatles.

00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:45.656
This “skiffle” genre started to get more and more popular, but it was still

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:50.346
a British phenomenon, not really exported outside of the United Kingdom.

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:56.536
And as you may know, The Beatles were far from an overnight success, they

00:05:56.536 --> 00:06:00.846
didn’t play together for the first time and just turn into immediate stars.

00:06:01.206 --> 00:06:03.526
That’s why you might not have heard about The Quarrymen.

00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:11.096
The band’s first iteration, The Quarrymen, was formed in 1956, the Beatles were only

00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:18.166
formed in 1960, and it wasn’t until 1963 that they had their first number one single, and

00:06:18.426 --> 00:06:24.506
they would have to wait another year, 1964, until they got to number 1 in the US charts.

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:32.473
This episode isn’t specifically about The Beatles, so we won’t go into their story in great detail.

00:06:32.823 --> 00:06:39.633
But the point to remind you about is that they spent this going on ten-year period honing their

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:45.979
craft and trying to get their big break playing thousands of hours in places like their hometown of

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:53.463
Liverpool, as well as Hamburg, in Germany, before they released their big hit, Love Me Do, in 1962.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:07:00.380
Now, let’s fast forward to 1964, precisely, to February 9th of

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.333
that year, when The Beatles first appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show.

00:07:05.513 --> 00:07:10.623
It wasn’t The Beatles’ first TV appearance in the US, but it would be the

00:07:10.623 --> 00:07:16.093
most important, catapulting them to national prominence and stardom, and

00:07:16.293 --> 00:07:20.453
launching the cultural invasion of the United States by British bands.

00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:27.366
Now, why did this happen, you might be asking yourself, why were the Beatles so popular?

00:07:28.126 --> 00:07:33.726
Well, if you are a Beatles fan, you will probably answer this question by saying “well,

00:07:33.876 --> 00:07:39.036
they just made fantastic music, hit after hit, year after year, they were just that good.

00:07:39.336 --> 00:07:39.936
That’s why”.

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:45.986
And of course, that is a perfectly valid point, but there are a few other

00:07:45.986 --> 00:07:50.606
factors that helped first The Beatles and then the British bands that followed.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:58.926
Firstly, this was the early 1960s, there was an increasing idea of “the teenager”, a

00:07:59.176 --> 00:08:05.786
particular period of one’s life when you were increasingly independent, perhaps rebellious,

00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:11.266
able to make your own choices, wanting to find people and bands that represented you.

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:18.506
This isn’t specific to the British bands, but it gives you some idea about the increasing

00:08:18.506 --> 00:08:24.076
proportion of US society that was available to become hooked on British rock music.

00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:30.306
Secondly, and moving on to specific reasons about British bands

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:35.126
and The Beatles themselves, The Beatles embodied youthful idealism,

00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:39.633
they were the perfect symbol for idealistic teenagers of the 1960s.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:43.649
For starters, they were young themselves.

00:08:43.869 --> 00:08:48.646
Ringo Starr, the oldest Beatle, was only 23 at the time of their

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:52.919
Ed Sullivan Show appearance, and George Harrison wasn’t even 20.

00:08:53.979 --> 00:08:59.499
It wasn’t like American teenagers didn’t have any of these symbols already, but one of the

00:08:59.499 --> 00:09:05.299
most prominent symbols, President JFK, had been assassinated in November the year before,

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:10.789
and the country was still reeling from the killing of its popular youthful President.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:15.829
The Beatles were perfectly positioned to fill this void.

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:21.849
They sang about positive ideas, their music was inspiring and optimistic.

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:29.319
They provided the musical equivalent of JFK’s inspirational speeches, so these four young men

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:35.699
from Liverpool were exactly what the country needed, they were a new emblem of youthful idealism.

00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:43.219
And thirdly, American music at the time had become somewhat formulaic and tired.

00:09:43.969 --> 00:09:47.419
Elvis Presley had been going for 10 years, and the

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:50.619
public were ready for something new and different.

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:57.709
And to bring it back to 1964, on the eve of the Ed Sullivan Show, so-called

00:09:58.062 --> 00:10:03.839
Beatlemania had been going on in the UK since the previous year, since 1963.

00:10:05.299 --> 00:10:11.629
The band had been playing to sold-out venues and adoring crowds for much of the previous year, so

00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:18.999
it was only a matter of time before this infectious Beatlemania virus reached the shores of America.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:26.769
And when it did, in 1964, the American musical landscape was never the same again.

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:33.419
In April of that year, The Beatles held all top five positions of the Billboard

00:10:33.429 --> 00:10:39.139
Hot 100 singles chart, something that no band had done before or has done since.

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:44.159
It’s hard to overestimate quite how big they were, how much

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:47.829
they dominated American music and culture in the 1960s.

00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:51.379
But of course, it wasn’t only The Beatles.

00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:56.119
They were followed by bands like The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The

00:10:56.119 --> 00:11:01.429
Animals, and the Who, and solo artists like Tom Jones and Dusty Springfield.

00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:06.419
Not only were Americans now listening to a huge amount of British music,

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:11.569
but American youth were emulating their favourite British singers.

00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:16.309
They dressed like them, they wore their hair like them and

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:21.159
suddenly Britain, London, everything British, was cool.

00:11:22.259 --> 00:11:26.919
Britain was out of its post-war funk, or at least, to many

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:31.509
American teenagers, British rock bands were the epitome of cool.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.429
It was dubbed “The British Invasion”.

00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:40.219
One day, there were practically no British bands that were popular in the US.

00:11:40.439 --> 00:11:46.259
But by the mid 1960s, the American charts were filled by British rock bands.

00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:52.349
What’s more, this “invasion”, and its subsequent cultural

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:56.909
impact, kicked off a boom in new musical groups in the US.

00:11:57.659 --> 00:12:01.129
American singers took inspiration from this British style of

00:12:01.129 --> 00:12:05.179
music, which was of course in part influenced by American music.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:12.859
And the result of this, for some American groups and entire genres, was a complete

00:12:12.969 --> 00:12:17.269
collapse in popularity, people just didn’t want to listen to them anymore.

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:22.229
In fact, some commentators have gone so far as to say

00:12:22.419 --> 00:12:26.039
that this British “invasion” destroyed American music.

00:12:27.419 --> 00:12:33.009
And the invasion continued, with a second wave in the late 1960s and

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:38.409
early 1970s which included bands like Cream, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:44.819
Sure, there were plenty of amazing homegrown bands, American groups, from

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:49.759
the Jimi Hendrix Experience to Jefferson Airplane to Simon & Garfunkel.

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:57.289
But ask 100 people, British or American, to name their favourite bands from the 1960s or

00:12:57.289 --> 00:13:03.489
1970s, and I’d be very surprised if you didn’t find out that a high proportion of these bands

00:13:03.719 --> 00:13:09.539
were British, despite the country being less than a third of the size of the US in the 1960s.

00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:17.789
This domination, this success, this “British Invasion”, continued to a certain degree

00:13:17.989 --> 00:13:24.251
in the 1980s, with bands like Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran, but, as you will know,

00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:29.531
subsequent British bands have failed to emulate the success of their predecessors.

00:13:30.791 --> 00:13:38.288
If you think of big, cult British bands from the 1990s such as Oasis and Blur, whose rivalry

00:13:38.288 --> 00:13:44.438
you can learn about in episode number 124 by the way, they never experienced any real success

00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:51.718
in the US, certainly nothing remotely comparable to the British bands of the 1960s and 1970s.

00:13:53.338 --> 00:14:00.488
In more recent years, bands like One Direction and Ed Sheeran have achieved success

00:14:00.638 --> 00:14:06.608
stateside, but with music that is kind of indistinguishable from manufactured

00:14:06.638 --> 00:14:11.758
American pop music; their success is not necessarily by bringing something

00:14:11.768 --> 00:14:16.808
new, but by producing something that American ears are used to listening to.

00:14:18.158 --> 00:14:25.588
And even with these hit stars, bands like One Direction and Little Mix or solo artists

00:14:25.648 --> 00:14:31.618
like Ed Sheeran or Adele, all of whom have achieved mainstream success in America,

00:14:32.398 --> 00:14:37.998
British music is simply not as popular any more, with one report suggesting that

00:14:38.008 --> 00:14:44.268
British artists only account for 7.6% of all music listened to in the United States.

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:47.308
Why is this then?

00:14:47.908 --> 00:14:52.518
Well, perhaps you can point to increasing cultural differences, perhaps you can

00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:56.778
point to the fact that American culture is influenced by many other different

00:14:56.778 --> 00:15:02.008
cultures, British culture simply isn’t so exotic or attractive any more.

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:07.698
Or there is also the fact that American record labels have realised

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:12.108
that they can easily clone, copy, successful British pop groups.

00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:17.968
This is what happened with American boy-bands like N-Sync and the Backstreet

00:15:17.968 --> 00:15:22.108
Boys, which, in case you didn’t know, were both modelled on British

00:15:22.148 --> 00:15:26.588
boy bands that came before them, specifically Take That and East 17.

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:34.758
This copying wasn’t possible with new, innovative groups like The Beatles or later

00:15:34.938 --> 00:15:40.598
Led Zeppelin, let’s say, bands that forged their own genres, but it’s perfectly

00:15:40.598 --> 00:15:44.428
possible with more generic groups that don’t write their own music anyway.

00:15:45.798 --> 00:15:50.898
Or perhaps, to continue answering the question of why British music isn’t so popular

00:15:50.898 --> 00:15:57.208
anymore, the simplistic but in my opinion most sensible explanation is the one you

00:15:57.208 --> 00:16:01.478
might think is most plausible to explain the success of The Beatles in America.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:08.348
The Beatles succeeded because they made fantastic music, music that is still listened to today.

00:16:08.828 --> 00:16:12.818
So, why aren’t British bands experiencing the same success?

00:16:13.528 --> 00:16:16.158
Well, the music simply isn’t good enough.

00:16:17.278 --> 00:16:22.398
Now, how I’d like to end this short exploration is by addressing the question

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:27.038
of why, in an episode all about amazing music, you haven’t heard any.

00:16:28.118 --> 00:16:32.908
An annoying thing called copyright infringement means I can’t play you any tracks from any of

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:39.178
these bands, but all I will say is that I hope that this might have inspired you to head straight

00:16:39.188 --> 00:16:46.168
to Spotify, or YouTube, your own record collection, or wherever you listen to your music, and

00:16:46.348 --> 00:16:52.868
fire up some Beatles or Rolling Stones, and experience this British Invasion for yourself.

00:16:54.828 --> 00:17:00.568
OK then, that is it for this short exploration of The British Invasion.

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:05.638
I hope it's been an interesting one, and whether you are the world’s biggest Beatles fan, or

00:17:05.888 --> 00:17:10.458
if you didn’t know anything about this period at all, well I hope you've learnt something new.

00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:14.558
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:15.148 --> 00:17:17.858
What are your favourite British bands, and why?

00:17:18.198 --> 00:17:25.078
Why do you think this British music of the 1960s and 1970s had such an outsized cultural impact?

00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:30.948
And, final question, what is the most underrated, the best but least

00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:34.408
known, band of this period one that everyone should know about?

00:17:35.288 --> 00:17:38.448
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.618

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.099
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.960
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.590
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Soft Power in the 21st century.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.819
You might remember that one of the first episodes we ever made, over 4 years

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.570
ago now, was about soft power in general, but in this episode we are going to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.120
revisit the topic by looking at three unusual but fascinating displays of soft

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.620
power: Korean pop music, the president of Ukraine and the sport of cricket.

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:53.971
OK then, soft power in the 21st century.

00:00:55.531 --> 00:01:02.841
Every year, a company called Brand Directory publishes something called The Global Soft Power Index.

00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:10.111
It is a report that surveys over 100,000 people across 101 different countries,

00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:16.111
and asks them a range of questions about how they feel towards other countries.

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:25.401
The end result is this large index, a comprehensive report that ranks 121 countries by

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:31.201
their so-called “soft power”, how attractive they are perceived to be on a global scale.

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:37.621
Every year the countries tend to change a bit, some increasing, others

00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:43.211
decreasing, but the rankings tend to be relatively similar year on year.

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:51.311
In 2023, the top country globally was, you might be able to guess, the United States of America.

00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:57.841
It was then followed by the UK, then Germany, then Japan, and China came in at number five.

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.931
And just to give you all of the top ten, France came sixth, then

00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:07.471
Canada, then Switzerland, then Italy at number nine, and the United

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:14.055
Arab Emirates shot up from number 15 in 2022 to number 10 in 2023.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.016
And if you’re wondering which country lost its spot in the top 10

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:23.471
this year, it was Russia, which went from number 9 to number 13.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:28.761
Now, don’t worry, I’m not going to spend the rest of this episode reading you out

00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:34.051
the rest of the list, but I wanted to start with this as I think it gives you a

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:40.021
useful introduction to think about “soft power”, and how it relates to the three

00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:45.361
examples we are going to talk about today: K-Pop, President Zelenskyy, and cricket.

00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:50.991
But first, let’s remind ourselves of what soft power is.

00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:59.371
The term was coined by a political theorist and Harvard professor called Joseph Nye in 1990.

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.341
It means the ability to exert power by attracting people,

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:09.711
rather than forcing them with military or economic means.

00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:18.172
He came up with the term to try to explain and understand the post-Cold War world, one in

00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:24.022
which power was more than about how strong your army was or how many nuclear weapons you had.

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:32.782
Power could also be “soft”, not “hard”, the carrot was just as important as the stick.

00:03:33.782 --> 00:03:39.462
You could be powerful by attraction, it was just as important for a country to invest in

00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:44.572
elements of its culture and society that would attract people from other countries rather

00:03:44.572 --> 00:03:50.003
than simply investing in its military capabilities in order to scare other countries.

00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:54.163
It was a message that came at the right time.

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:59.463
American military dominance was waning, and “soft

00:03:59.483 --> 00:04:03.723
power” was seen as a useful tool to counterbalance this.

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:09.623
And soft power, of course, isn’t something limited to the United States.

00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:14.963
In the post Cold War era, countries all over the world have continued

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:19.753
to invest in soft power initiatives, projects to improve the way

00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:22.963
in which their country is perceived by people in other countries.

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:28.963
From organisations like the British Council, which promotes British culture and of course

00:04:29.173 --> 00:04:34.030
teaches people English, right through to China’s Confucius Institutes,  which do the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.096
same thing but for China and Mandarin,  many countries all over the world invest heavily

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:46.066
in initiatives that make their country and culture seem more attractive to foreigners.

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:52.906
These examples are some obvious, government-sponsored soft power initiatives,

00:04:53.446 --> 00:05:00.386
but more often than not a country's soft power comes from unexpected places.

00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:05.836
And it is three examples of this that we are going to talk about today:

00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:11.926
Korean Pop Music, the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Cricket.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:16.936
Let’s start with Korean Pop Music, or K-Pop for short.

00:05:18.316 --> 00:05:22.556
South Korea is a relatively small country, just over 50

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:26.066
million people, with pretty limited natural resources.

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:33.496
But it packs a sizable punch when it comes to pop music, and soft power overall.

00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:41.396
The band BTS is perhaps Korea’s most successful recent export, and it is certainly the

00:05:41.396 --> 00:05:46.846
country’s most successful musical export, after selling more than 40 million albums.

00:05:47.756 --> 00:05:49.666
You’ve probably heard a BTS song.

00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:53.806
They are absolutely everywhere, and are so big that they were

00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:57.266
even asked to visit The White House to meet President Joe Biden.

00:05:58.156 --> 00:06:02.176
Now, it’s unclear whether the then 80-year-old American President

00:06:02.436 --> 00:06:07.296
knew who BTS were, but their cultural impact has been huge.

00:06:08.116 --> 00:06:11.026
They managed to sell out London’s Wembley Stadium,

00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:14.496
something that only 12 artists have ever managed to do.

00:06:15.026 --> 00:06:20.916
They got 100 million views on Youtube in 48 hours, and got four no.

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:23.776
1 albums as quickly as The Beatles did.

00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:29.806
And this isn’t merely the story of one group that struck it lucky.

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:36.789
BTS are surfing a wave that started in the late 1990s, something called “Hallyu”.

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:43.426
Hallyu comes from the Mandarin, hánliú, and it literally means “Korean Wave”.

00:06:44.766 --> 00:06:49.166
It refers to the mass popularisation of Korean culture outside Korea.

00:06:50.066 --> 00:06:55.506
It started in mainland China, where Korean soap operas and TV dramas became

00:06:55.506 --> 00:07:01.446
incredibly popular in the late 1990s, and has now spread all over the world with

00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:08.291
Korean cultural exports: movies and TV shows like Parasite and Squid Game, and K-Pop

00:07:08.456 --> 00:07:14.634
like Psy’s hit single Gangnam Style and the chart-topping sensation that is BTS.

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:19.146
Now, how, you might be asking, has such a small country

00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:22.696
managed to have such an outsized cultural impact?

00:07:23.606 --> 00:07:29.886
Well, for a country to produce great musicians, filmmakers and artists, clearly it needs to have

00:07:29.886 --> 00:07:35.896
a certain base level of economic security and prosperity; great filmmakers and musicians are

00:07:35.946 --> 00:07:40.726
unlikely to emerge if there are no jobs available and they struggle to put food on the table.

00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:46.876
Many countries have this, of course, so what is so special about South Korea?

00:07:48.036 --> 00:07:54.006
Well, governments certainly do not “create” culture, but there are certain things that a

00:07:54.016 --> 00:08:00.506
government can do to help foster an environment in which culture can be created by its citizens.

00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:06.033
In the case of Korea, this does appear to be intentional.

00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:10.912
There is a story about a government report that was published in

00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:15.772
1994, shortly after the release of the first Jurassic Park movie.

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:22.862
The author of the report stated that the Korean government would make the same amount of money by

00:08:22.862 --> 00:08:30.072
making just one hit movie like Jurassic Park as it would from selling 1.5 million Hyundai cars.

00:08:31.482 --> 00:08:36.782
This was clearly an attractive proposition; instead of doing the capital and

00:08:36.842 --> 00:08:42.012
labour intensive work of producing cars, it could make one hit movie that would

00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:47.662
not only generate as much revenue but also help change Korea’s global reputation

00:08:48.092 --> 00:08:53.602
from the world’s factory to a premier creator of global culture and entertainment.

00:08:55.112 --> 00:09:00.062
After this, the Korean government put into place a series of initiatives that

00:09:00.092 --> 00:09:05.182
encouraged people to take up creative pursuits, it fostered an environment in which

00:09:05.192 --> 00:09:11.052
future creatives could thrive, and the result is the Korean Wave that we see today.

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:17.792
But, of course, a country cannot simply throw money at so-called “cultural projects”

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:24.162
and hope that a BTS or a Squid Game or a Parasite will emerge a few years later.

00:09:25.152 --> 00:09:29.945
There are plenty of other factors that are at play, and in the case of the

00:09:29.955 --> 00:09:35.915
gigantic success of K-Pop, one important factor that is often referenced is the

00:09:35.965 --> 00:09:40.875
close links to American musical culture that were forged after the Korean War.

00:09:42.355 --> 00:09:48.325
As you may know, the US has maintained a military presence in South Korea since the Korean War.

00:09:49.285 --> 00:09:54.085
Even today, there are over 20,000 US soldiers stationed in the country.

00:09:55.435 --> 00:09:59.975
One of the main influences of K-Pop is thought to be the early years of the

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:05.155
US military presence, when Korean bands would perform music that was heavily

00:10:05.205 --> 00:10:09.905
influenced by US pop music, but with a distinctly Korean element to it.

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:16.955
And of course modern K-Pop has similarities with US pop music, but it

00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:21.265
is unique in its style, it is visibly different from Western pop music.

00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:25.514
It is highly manufactured, with flawless performances

00:10:25.744 --> 00:10:28.654
and highly disciplined and choreographed shows.

00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:35.589
And of course, from BTS to Psy, it is unbelievably popular all across the world.

00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:42.904
And if you are thinking “so what”, well K-Pop has had a huge impact directly

00:10:43.054 --> 00:10:47.444
on Korea’s soft power, and brought tangible benefits to South Korea.

00:10:48.684 --> 00:10:55.644
In 2017, BTS was the reason that 1 in 13 tourists visited Korea.

00:10:56.634 --> 00:11:00.844
Korean is the 7th most popular language to learn on Duolingo,

00:11:01.264 --> 00:11:04.454
despite the fact that it is certainly not an easy language.

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:10.384
And Korea currently ranks number 15 on the global soft power charts.

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:14.043
Not bad for a country that, in 1980.

00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:21.131
had a GDP per capita that was between Ivory Coast and Colombia, and is still dwarfed

00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:26.101
by two powerful neighbours in the form of China to the West and Japan to the East.

00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:34.251
Now, our next stop on this soft power exploration will be Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine.

00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:41.551
To state the obvious, this is a very different kind of soft power to K-Pop, but let’s

00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:46.901
remember that soft power comes from the perception foreigners have of a country.

00:11:48.271 --> 00:11:53.341
Often this comes from the individuals who are the most visible representations of a country.

00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:57.631
This can be its pop stars, its actors or its footballers,

00:11:57.951 --> 00:12:01.241
but it’s also the politicians who lead the country.

00:12:02.631 --> 00:12:08.601
In the case of Zelenskyy, this presents an interesting way to explore the idea of soft power.

00:12:10.111 --> 00:12:14.921
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, it might have

00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:19.061
seemed like soft power would play no role in the conflict.

00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:26.711
After all, soft power is a long game, it's a question of attraction and persuasion.

00:12:28.181 --> 00:12:33.311
Hard power, on the other hand, refers to military action and economic

00:12:33.376 --> 00:12:38.639
sanctions, the cold steel of a rifle and the musty smell of dollar bills.

00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:46.321
And as Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine and jets started dropping bombs on Ukrainian

00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:50.861
cities, there were bigger priorities than making sure that Ukrainian culture could

00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:55.721
flourish and be attractive to foreigners; it was a case of national survival.

00:12:56.931 --> 00:13:03.111
But soft power is about attraction and persuasion, and Zelenskyy provided

00:13:03.121 --> 00:13:08.101
a masterclass on the importance of perception to attract and persuade.

00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:14.701
Famously, when he was offered assistance to leave the country, when it looked like he

00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:20.811
might be captured by Russian forces, he responded with “I need ammunition, not a ride”.

00:13:22.021 --> 00:13:27.441
He would release videos of him in camouflage clothing, army gear, wandering through

00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:32.591
the rubble of Kiev, talking directly to the individual on the other side of the camera.

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.521
He was talking to you and to me.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:42.591
He would give military-style briefings, was careful to be seen as a leader on the ground,

00:13:43.131 --> 00:13:48.981
conscious that he was to many people outside Ukraine, the symbol of Ukrainian resistance.

00:13:50.581 --> 00:13:56.071
And while Vladimir Putin might have thought, or at least hoped, that Zelenskyy

00:13:56.201 --> 00:14:00.651
would have left Ukraine out of fear that he'd be killed or captured, he didn’t.

00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:06.001
He stayed, and made sure that he used every tool at his disposal

00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:10.211
to keep Ukraine front and centre of the international news.

00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:15.861
And the result was what we see today, a huge outpouring

00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:19.051
of sympathy and support for Ukraine in the West.

00:14:20.181 --> 00:14:24.601
Now, this is not to suggest that things would have gone completely differently

00:14:24.891 --> 00:14:31.641
if Zelenskyy had acted in a different way, or to demean the bravery and sacrifice

00:14:31.711 --> 00:14:36.831
of the Ukrainian people, but let me ask you to do a quick thought experiment.

00:14:38.241 --> 00:14:42.901
Imagine that, instead of Zelensky in his green t-shirt and army trousers

00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:47.871
from a bunker in Kiev, Ukraine had been led by a 70-year-old man in a

00:14:47.871 --> 00:14:52.901
suit who had fled on the first plane to the safety of Germany, let’s say.

00:14:54.151 --> 00:14:58.201
Would there've been exactly the same amount of goodwill towards Ukraine?

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:02.761
Perhaps you could argue it would be the same, but I

00:15:02.761 --> 00:15:05.421
can't imagine you could argue it would have been more.

00:15:06.751 --> 00:15:13.381
What’s abundantly clear is that Zelenskyy was and still is a very savvy media operator.

00:15:14.137 --> 00:15:18.337
And the result has been, as we all know, not only a vast amount of

00:15:18.337 --> 00:15:22.697
financial and military aid from Western governments to Ukraine but,

00:15:23.237 --> 00:15:27.687
overall, support for this from the people of those Western governments.

00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:33.787
Soft power in the form of people being attracted by the behaviour of the leader of

00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:40.037
a country has transformed into hard power in the form of military and financial aid.

00:15:41.197 --> 00:15:46.417
And again to reference Duolingo, Ukrainian went from the 37th most

00:15:46.417 --> 00:15:52.730
popular language to learn in 2021 to the 17th most popular in 2022.

00:15:54.002 --> 00:15:59.682
Now, I want to move on to our third and final example, that of cricket.

00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:05.379
This is kind of two examples rolled into one, as we’ll be

00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:09.359
looking at cricket and soft power in two separate countries.

00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:17.479
Cricket, as you may know, was invented in England, and became popular in the 18th and 19th

00:16:17.499 --> 00:16:24.099
centuries as a "gentleman's game", something played by upper class men of the Victorian era.

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:30.109
In England it's still relatively popular, but it pales

00:16:30.119 --> 00:16:34.119
in comparison to football, and even to rugby and tennis.

00:16:35.859 --> 00:16:41.049
As the British Empire continued to colonise every corner of the world, the officers

00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:46.539
of the Empire brought with them their favourite sports, including, of course, cricket.

00:16:47.969 --> 00:16:51.559
It turned out that, in many of these countries, cricket

00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:54.709
became very popular, even after the British left.

00:16:56.139 --> 00:17:01.215
If you look at the list of the best cricketing countries in the world, you will see a theme.

00:17:02.215 --> 00:17:06.385
Australia, England of course, South Africa, New Zealand,

00:17:06.745 --> 00:17:11.535
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.

00:17:13.035 --> 00:17:18.095
All of these countries were, at one point in time, under British colonial

00:17:18.095 --> 00:17:23.255
rule, and the fact that this unusual sport became so popular there created

00:17:23.265 --> 00:17:27.895
a strong link between those countries and their coloniser, Britain.

00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:35.105
But you might have noticed that there is one important country missing in that list the

00:17:35.105 --> 00:17:39.935
country that is, as of the time of recording this episode, the top-ranked cricketing

00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:45.535
country in the world, and a country with almost a billion cricket fans: India.

00:17:47.015 --> 00:17:51.035
If you´ve been to India, you will know quite how popular cricket is.

00:17:51.685 --> 00:17:58.245
93% of all sport watched on TV in India is cricket, the Indian Cricket League

00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:04.125
is the most valuable in the world, at a reported $30 billion, and Indian

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:09.285
cricket stars are some of the best paid sportspeople in the entire world.

00:18:10.675 --> 00:18:15.095
Now, other than there just being a lot of money in it and people inside

00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:19.835
India being passionate about cricket, how does this relate to soft power?

00:18:21.335 --> 00:18:27.245
Well, much like football is an important factor in the soft power of countries like England,

00:18:27.435 --> 00:18:33.095
Spain and Italy, the fact that India is the world’s premier destination for cricket is a

00:18:33.115 --> 00:18:38.105
contributor to the country’s soft power among the world’s growing number of cricket fans.

00:18:38.845 --> 00:18:42.925
India, not England, is the world's top cricketing destination.

00:18:44.425 --> 00:18:51.235
And, like with Zelenskyy and Ukraine in our previous example, cricket is also an interesting

00:18:51.245 --> 00:18:59.865
bridge between soft and hard power: both in 1987 and in 2011, after heightened periods of

00:18:59.895 --> 00:19:06.565
tension between India and Pakistan, the leaders of both countries decided to display a show

00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:13.945
of unity by meeting at a sporting event loved by both Indians and Pakistanis: a cricket match.

00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:20.775
Now, cricket is only one element of Indian soft power; clearly there

00:19:20.775 --> 00:19:23.965
are many more attractive things about the world’s most populous country.

00:19:24.765 --> 00:19:30.375
But cricket is an interesting example because it is something that was originally a symbol of

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:36.365
British power, and is still a link between the coloniser and its now much more powerful colony.

00:19:37.425 --> 00:19:43.325
But cricket has been transformed into something uniquely Indian, the “home of

00:19:43.325 --> 00:19:48.995
cricket” now as much Eden Gardens in Kolkata as it is Lord’s Stadium in London.

00:19:49.775 --> 00:19:53.335
So, there we go, a little exploration of soft power

00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:56.895
through the lens of K-Pop, Zelenskyy and cricket.

00:19:58.005 --> 00:20:03.605
In an age where the power of a country is often measured by the strength of its economy or the might

00:20:03.655 --> 00:20:10.195
of its military, these examples remind us that influence often springs from unexpected sources.

00:20:11.335 --> 00:20:16.795
The soft power of culture, leadership, and sport has the ability to transcend

00:20:16.795 --> 00:20:22.805
boundaries, alter perceptions, and sometimes, even change the course of history.

00:20:24.834 --> 00:20:27.884
OK then, that is it for today's little exploration of

00:20:27.884 --> 00:20:31.944
soft power through three unusual and unrelated examples.

00:20:32.614 --> 00:20:35.254
As always, I'd love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:35.684 --> 00:20:36.924
Are you a fan of K-Pop?

00:20:37.384 --> 00:20:42.714
How much impact do you think Zelenskyy had on the perception of Ukrainian resistance abroad?

00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:45.664
And what comes next for Indian cricket?

00:20:46.154 --> 00:20:49.279
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

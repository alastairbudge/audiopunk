Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:16.296
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:20.566
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:25.026
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a people

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:30.116
who are not officially citizens of anywhere, the Bidoon of Kuwait.

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:35.366
In this episode we’ll learn who the Bidoon are, why they are considered

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:40.806
stateless, what life is like if you are stateless–and here’s a spoiler alert,

00:00:41.096 --> 00:00:46.686
it’s not particularly easy–and ask ourselves whether there is any end in sight.

00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:53.478
OK then, let’s get started and learn about the plight of the Bidoon.

00:00:55.314 --> 00:01:00.852
2019 was a busy year for the Irish embassy in London.

00:01:01.622 --> 00:01:06.332
It was flooded with requests for new passports and ended up issuing

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:12.552
120,000, double the amount it was used to issuing a few years before.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:15.182
Why, you might be thinking?

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:22.232
Well, the UK had voted for Brexit in 2016, and it would

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:28.482
officially leave the European Union on January 31st, 2020.

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:36.282
This surge of new Irish passport applications was from people who had never previously

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:43.382
had an Irish passport but were scrambling to get one before Brexit officially took place.

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:49.362
The Republic of Ireland, as you may know, is still part of the European

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:54.902
Union, so any Irish citizen can enjoy the same privileges as any

00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:58.862
other EU citizen when it comes to things like freedom of movement.

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:05.032
Of course, Ireland wasn’t handing out citizenship and passports to anyone who

00:02:05.032 --> 00:02:10.452
asked; you had to have a legitimate claim to be Irish, which typically means

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:15.682
either being born in Ireland or having an Irish-born parent or grandparent.

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:22.632
It didn’t matter if you weren’t born in Ireland, in some cases it didn’t even matter if your parents

00:02:22.702 --> 00:02:29.682
weren’t born in Ireland, if you had an acceptable link, lucky you, Irish citizenship was yours.

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:36.642
On the other side of the world, however, there are people who are not quite so lucky, as they

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:42.232
live in a country that is not quite so accommodating when it comes to handing out citizenship.

00:02:42.932 --> 00:02:49.602
In Kuwait, there are people who might never have left the country, whose parents, grandparents, and

00:02:49.622 --> 00:02:55.532
all known relatives might never have left the country, people who might have no links to any other

00:02:55.532 --> 00:03:02.622
country nor have the citizenship of another country, yet are not granted citizenship of Kuwait.

00:03:03.252 --> 00:03:05.872
They are citizens of nowhere.

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:12.852
These are the Bidoon, a people without a state to call their own.

00:03:14.072 --> 00:03:18.102
Not only can they not officially leave the country, because they have no

00:03:18.142 --> 00:03:24.042
passport, but more importantly they are completely locked out from accessing

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:28.832
public services because they have no government ID, no national identity.

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:34.382
Before we get into the question of how and why, we first

00:03:34.382 --> 00:03:38.112
need a brief geographical and historical refresher.

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:42.952
Kuwait is a country at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.

00:03:43.692 --> 00:03:47.769
It’s small, at just under 18,000 square kilometres.

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:55.072
To give you a reference point, that makes it smaller than the metropolitan area of Paris.

00:03:56.352 --> 00:04:00.962
To the south is Saudi Arabia, to the north and east is

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:07.012
Iraq, and just past Iraq, only 45 kilometres away, is Iran.

00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:14.202
This geopolitical position, sandwiched between three large countries, has always

00:04:14.202 --> 00:04:20.402
made the small country highly sensitive to external influences, which partly explains

00:04:20.412 --> 00:04:24.452
its cautious stance on citizenship, which is what we’ll be talking about today.

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:33.002
Now, there is evidence of people living in the area for thousands of years, both nomadic

00:04:33.012 --> 00:04:38.612
people, who would travel from place to place, and people who settled in villages and towns.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:46.982
And for most of its history, the area now known as Kuwait was a collection of small settlements.

00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:54.842
But in 1752, Kuwait became an independent country for the first time, under the rule

00:04:54.852 --> 00:05:00.672
of a man named Sabah I bin Jaber, a man whose descendants still rule the country today.

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:05.502
Between its founding as an independent nation and today,

00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:09.488
however, the country has gone through several iterations.

00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:14.172
Under increasing threat from the Ottomans, it struck a deal

00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:18.562
with Britain and became a British protectorate in 1899.

00:05:19.742 --> 00:05:25.092
Importantly, this didn't make Kuwait a British colony, and it wasn’t captured

00:05:25.092 --> 00:05:29.942
by Britain, but it did effectively outsource all diplomatic relations

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:34.452
to Britain and meant that Kuwait wasn’t really an independent country.

00:05:35.582 --> 00:05:41.352
It was a poor country, with most people in the country living a subsistence lifestyle.

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:47.503
But, in 1937, a discovery was made that would change everything.

00:05:48.573 --> 00:05:48.983
Oil.

00:05:50.643 --> 00:05:57.683
Despite its miniature size, Kuwait has approximately 8% of the world’s oil reserves.

00:05:58.723 --> 00:06:07.293
It started to export its oil in 1946, and by 1952 it was the largest oil exporter in the region.

00:06:08.313 --> 00:06:14.113
It declared full independence from Britain in 1961, and since then it has

00:06:14.113 --> 00:06:18.493
gone from one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest.

00:06:19.913 --> 00:06:26.263
With the declaration of independence in 1961, and with full responsibility over its own

00:06:26.263 --> 00:06:33.006
administration and security, Kuwait needed to fully figure out and document its citizens.

00:06:33.556 --> 00:06:39.713
So it encouraged all eligible Kuwaitis to come forward and claim citizenship,

00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:44.193
to make themselves official in the eyes of the Kuwaiti government.

00:06:45.743 --> 00:06:50.493
There was already legislation in place that outlined who did and didn’t

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:56.283
qualify for Kuwaiti citizenship, but this was updated in 1959 with the

00:06:56.303 --> 00:07:01.790
“Nationality Law”, which clarified the conditions to qualify for citizenship.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:09.590
Like most laws, it is long and complicated but there are a few key points to mention.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.600
Firstly, anyone who could prove that they or their ancestors had settled in

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:22.631
Kuwait before the year 1920 would automatically qualify for Kuwaiti citizenship.

00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:27.851
The relevance of 1920, by the way, is because it was the year

00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:32.071
of a key battle between Saudi-backed militants and Kuwait.

00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:38.621
The Kuwaitis won, and so this 1920 date was taken as being that anyone who was

00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:44.221
there at the time of this key military victory by default deserved citizenship.

00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:52.901
Secondly, for those who didn’t have or couldn’t prove Kuwaiti roots going back to 1920, there

00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:58.641
were paths to naturalisation, there were other ways in which you could obtain citizenship.

00:07:59.371 --> 00:08:05.231
For example, if you had lived in Kuwait for 15 years or more and could prove

00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:09.911
that you were an upstanding citizen, then there were ways you could officially

00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:14.897
become a citizen of Kuwait, even if your parents didn’t have official citizenship.

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:21.877
Now, the key element with both of these conditions of the law is around proof:

00:08:22.357 --> 00:08:27.107
being able to prove that you were in Kuwait in 1920 or that your ancestors

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:32.907
were, or being able to prove that you'd been in the country for over 15 years.

00:08:35.107 --> 00:08:38.957
For some people this was easy: birth certificates,

00:08:39.147 --> 00:08:42.127
official documents, employment contracts, and so on.

00:08:42.997 --> 00:08:45.297
But for others, it was not.

00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:48.984
And this brings us to the Bidoon.

00:08:49.818 --> 00:08:56.317
Now, on a linguistic note, “Bidoon” means “without” in Arabic, and is an

00:08:56.317 --> 00:09:02.327
abbreviation of the phrase “Bidoon jinsiya”, meaning “without nationality.”

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:08.457
And to clarify, “Bidoon” is different from “Bedouin”, which is

00:09:08.457 --> 00:09:12.487
the name for a larger nomadic people throughout the Arab world.

00:09:13.357 --> 00:09:21.967
Confusingly, most Bidoon are, or were, Bedouins, they were nomadic, but Bedouins are not all Bidoon.

00:09:22.897 --> 00:09:28.507
And on one more administrative note, Kuwait isn’t the only country with Bidoon; there

00:09:28.507 --> 00:09:34.627
are stateless Bidoon in other Gulf countries, mainly Saudi Arabia, but today we’ll keep

00:09:34.637 --> 00:09:39.947
the discussion to the Kuwaiti Bidoon, as that is where their plight is most obvious.

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:46.467
Historically, the Bidoon was a nomadic group, a group that travelled from

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:51.207
one place to another, never staying in one place for an extended period.

00:09:51.997 --> 00:09:56.627
The world is full of nomadic people, but the Middle East has always been

00:09:56.657 --> 00:10:00.887
home to a particularly high proportion of the world’s nomadic population.

00:10:01.797 --> 00:10:04.207
It is, in some ways, obvious.

00:10:04.677 --> 00:10:10.477
The region is filled with deserts, and there is not an abundance of arable land and fresh water.

00:10:11.107 --> 00:10:15.067
People needed to keep moving from one place to another to make

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:18.407
sure that they and their animals had enough to eat and drink.

00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:26.377
And this nomadic lifestyle, historically at least, would completely ignore national borders.

00:10:27.037 --> 00:10:31.597
Borders were man-made creations, imaginary lines in the sand.

00:10:32.107 --> 00:10:35.797
If you were crossing the desert on a camel and you navigated by the

00:10:35.797 --> 00:10:41.197
stars you had little idea where one state ended and the next one started.

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:43.037
It simply didn’t matter.

00:10:43.827 --> 00:10:48.517
You lived within your nomadic community, your tribe; it was where you were born,

00:10:48.897 --> 00:10:54.007
raised, and died, like your parents, their parents, and their parents before them.

00:10:55.517 --> 00:11:01.727
And for nomadic Bidoon, in the early 1960s when there were calls from the Kuwaiti

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:06.187
government for every eligible person in the country to come forward and claim

00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:11.217
citizenship, many simply never got the message, they never heard about it.

00:11:12.027 --> 00:11:15.107
Many who did hear about it just didn’t understand the

00:11:15.117 --> 00:11:18.427
benefit of claiming citizenship; what would it do for them?

00:11:18.997 --> 00:11:24.937
To them, formal borders and state institutions were new, foreign concepts.

00:11:25.357 --> 00:11:31.207
They lived outside mainstream society, so why should they register to collect a piece of paper?

00:11:31.847 --> 00:11:35.527
It sounded like a lot of work, without any tangible benefit.

00:11:36.107 --> 00:11:42.397
And even for those who did try to register, there was the additional problem that most were

00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:47.177
illiterate, they couldn’t read or write, making it hard to understand what they needed to do.

00:11:48.147 --> 00:11:53.017
And even if they were able to understand what they needed to do, there was

00:11:53.017 --> 00:11:58.147
the question of documentation, and proving they were who they said they were.

00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:04.637
Their parents or grandparents might well have been in Kuwait in 1920, they

00:12:04.637 --> 00:12:08.257
might have ticked every single box when it came to having the right to

00:12:08.257 --> 00:12:12.137
having Kuwaiti citizenship, they might have lived their entire life in Kuwait

00:12:12.397 --> 00:12:18.097
and never left the country, but it was hard, perhaps impossible, to prove.

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:24.517
There were no official birth certificates, no documents to prove Kuwaiti ancestry.

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:30.897
Early in the citizenship process, early in Kuwait’s history as an independent

00:12:30.907 --> 00:12:35.487
nation, the authorities appeared to be more understanding of this.

00:12:36.397 --> 00:12:41.537
Many Bidoon were granted Kuwaiti citizenship, they were given the same social

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:46.817
security benefits as everyone else, and they were allowed to hold normal jobs.

00:12:47.737 --> 00:12:56.083
And at one point, a reported 80% of the entire Kuwaiti army was made up of Bidoon.

00:12:57.172 --> 00:13:02.572
But today, the Bidoon is the most marginalised group in Kuwait.

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:08.592
Most are stateless, invisible, and without any path to

00:13:08.592 --> 00:13:12.512
citizenship and therefore the ability to live a normal life.

00:13:13.562 --> 00:13:18.142
When a baby is born to a Bidoon mother, they do not receive an official

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.875
birth certificate, as a Bidoon you do not receive an official Kuwaiti

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:27.775
identification card, you are completely shut out from Kuwaiti society.

00:13:29.155 --> 00:13:32.515
And we aren’t talking about a few hundred people here.

00:13:33.235 --> 00:13:36.915
The official number from the Kuwaiti government is around

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:42.945
120,000, but other estimates place it at over 200,000.

00:13:43.945 --> 00:13:51.349
And Kuwait only has 1.5 million citizens, so it is a sizeable chunk of the population.

00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:55.569
So, why are they so marginalised?

00:13:55.919 --> 00:14:00.533
Is it just a question of Kuwait tightening up its bureaucracy, and of

00:14:00.533 --> 00:14:04.319
the Bidoon not being able to prove that they are who they say they are?

00:14:05.289 --> 00:14:10.659
Well, Kuwaiti authorities say yes, but NGOs like Amnesty

00:14:10.659 --> 00:14:13.899
International say that it is more complicated than that.

00:14:15.259 --> 00:14:21.129
Instead of it being a simple case of missing papers, it is a coordinated effort on

00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:26.629
the part of Kuwait to marginalise this nomadic group, especially in recent years.

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:33.299
In other words, they have been singled out and shut out of society on purpose.

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:40.629
And according to NGOs in the region, there are a few reasons as to why.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:48.999
The key thing is that the major change happened in the late 1980s and early 1990s when

00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:54.759
Kuwait was under increasing pressure and aggression from its northern neighbour, Iraq.

00:14:55.909 --> 00:15:00.269
During the Gulf War, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, Kuwaiti

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:05.219
officials claimed that Bidoon had collaborated with the Iraqis.

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:12.709
Although it is debated whether this is true, it has led to deep scepticism about the

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:18.779
true allegiance of the Bidoon, and a sense that this entire group cannot be trusted.

00:15:20.049 --> 00:15:24.439
On a related note, the Kuwaiti government has argued that the Bidoon

00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:29.269
are full of foreign nationals, people from neighbouring countries like

00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:33.789
Iraq and Saudi Arabia, who have no right to claim they are Kuwaiti.

00:15:34.439 --> 00:15:38.379
They are claiming that they are Kuwaiti so they are entitled to Kuwait’s

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:44.069
generous welfare benefits, when in reality they are not Kuwaiti in the slightest.

00:15:45.079 --> 00:15:49.739
The Kuwaiti government fears that allowing the Bidoon citizenship would open

00:15:49.739 --> 00:15:54.699
the doors for more people to claim citizenship under the guise of being Bidoon.

00:15:56.199 --> 00:16:00.879
It’s also believed that most Bidoon are Shia, they are Shia Muslims,

00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:06.529
and the majority of Kuwait, including its ruling family, is Sunni.

00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:12.769
And without getting too deep into the history of Islam and the theological

00:16:12.769 --> 00:16:18.149
reasons behind it, as I’m sure you will know, Shia and Sunni Muslims have had

00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:23.052
their fair share of differences and distrust of one another, to put it mildly.

00:16:24.742 --> 00:16:29.162
And finally, there is the argument that it is actually quite convenient

00:16:29.322 --> 00:16:34.182
for the state of Kuwait to have its own mass of second-class citizens

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.150
We’ll come to this in greater detail in a minute, but being shut out of mainstream

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:48.470
society forces people to turn to casual, informal and typically poorly paid work, so this

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:56.150
undocumented mass of the population is, sadly, a convenient underclass of the Kuwaiti state.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.060
In other words, they do the poorly paid and unpleasant

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.260
work that Kuwaiti citizens simply don’t want to do.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:11.600
And in terms of what life is like for the Bidoon, and how being stateless affects your

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.810
day-to-day life, as you might imagine, it makes life difficult and pretty miserable.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.390
Without citizenship, they are cut off from all government services - healthcare,

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:27.920
education, bank accounts, practically every form of bureaucracy.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:35.950
Children born to stateless Bidoon parents cannot attend free government school, and the only

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:43.370
option for an education is to be sent to private schools, which are lower quality and expensive.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.450
So, many Bidoon children simply do not go to school,

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.190
further damaging their already dismal employment prospects.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:58.340
And in terms of employment, again, the Bidoon typically have to work in the shadows,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:04.230
working informally in low-paying and insecure jobs, with no legal protection.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:12.131
And in a wealthy country like Kuwait, this makes the Bidoon stand out even more.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:19.320
In Kuwait, there is already a large gulf between the citizens of Kuwait, who only make up

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:25.525
just over 30% of the population, and the foreign workers who make up the majority of the

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:32.150
population but can’t access the extremely generous welfare system enjoyed by Kuwaiti citizens.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.520
Kuwait’s huge oil reserves allow it to offer its citizens free education,

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:44.120
healthcare, subsidised housing, and well-paid and secure public sector jobs.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:51.030
But foreigners, who have been imported to fill labour-intensive, often low-paid jobs,

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.482
have to turn to the expensive and typically lower-quality private sector for all of this.

00:18:57.922 --> 00:19:03.762
And the contrast between the relative luxury and comfort afforded to the average Kuwaiti

00:19:03.762 --> 00:19:09.902
citizen and the conditions under which the Bidoon have to live is particularly jarring.

00:19:11.162 --> 00:19:17.392
Another layer of complexity behind all of this is the gender bias in Kuwait’s nationality law.

00:19:18.762 --> 00:19:24.162
Like in many Gulf countries, in Kuwait, citizenship is passed through the

00:19:24.172 --> 00:19:29.452
father, not the mother, meaning that children born to Kuwaiti mothers and

00:19:29.452 --> 00:19:34.602
Bidoon or foreign fathers do not automatically receive Kuwaiti citizenship.

00:19:35.992 --> 00:19:40.822
This leaves many Bidoon children stateless and without access to the benefits

00:19:40.822 --> 00:19:45.882
of Kuwaiti nationality, even if their mother has Kuwaiti citizenship.

00:19:47.212 --> 00:19:51.892
For Bidoon families, this makes the cycle of statelessness even

00:19:51.902 --> 00:19:56.067
harder to break, further marginalising them in Kuwaiti society.

00:19:57.687 --> 00:20:01.847
Sadly, there seems to be little opportunity for this to change.

00:20:02.437 --> 00:20:06.267
Kuwait says it needs to see proof, official documents,

00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:09.727
before it hands out prized Kuwaiti citizenship.

00:20:10.617 --> 00:20:15.427
The Bidoon cannot provide this proof, because they never had it in the first place.

00:20:16.757 --> 00:20:21.497
And it is not like there is any other country that can or should take them.

00:20:22.267 --> 00:20:27.687
Kuwait has argued in the past that Iraq and Saudi Arabia should give citizenship

00:20:27.687 --> 00:20:33.367
to qualifying Bidoon, but Iraq and Saudi Arabia have generally rejected this,

00:20:33.707 --> 00:20:38.337
on the grounds that the Bidoon are more Kuwaiti than they are Iraqi or Saudi.

00:20:38.927 --> 00:20:42.937
They are Kuwait’s issue to resolve, they are nobody else’s problem.

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:50.777
So, there they are, stuck in this diplomatic limbo: stateless, citizens of nowhere,

00:20:51.097 --> 00:20:55.777
living in a country that they call home, but that refuses to recognise them.

00:20:57.147 --> 00:21:04.623
Now, to end things on a slightly positive note, there are some signs of hope for the Bidoon.

00:21:05.137 --> 00:21:10.667
There is increasing international pressure on Kuwait from NGOs to solve the issue of the

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:16.867
Bidoons’ citizenship, and some signs that this is an issue Kuwait cannot ignore forever.

00:21:18.017 --> 00:21:23.027
After all, Kuwait is a signatory to several important international agreements

00:21:23.347 --> 00:21:27.497
binding it to give legal rights and citizenship to stateless people.

00:21:28.397 --> 00:21:32.477
But, as you’ve heard, despite having signed these conventions,

00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:36.827
Kuwait seems to have no qualms about continuing to violate them.

00:21:38.342 --> 00:21:42.682
In 2014 a United Nations initiative was launched to

00:21:42.762 --> 00:21:48.002
end statelessness within a decade, so by the year 2024.

00:21:49.582 --> 00:21:55.292
That  has not happened but while change is slow, international pressure is

00:21:55.292 --> 00:22:00.092
mounting, and the Bidoon issue is gaining more attention on the world stage.

00:22:01.222 --> 00:22:05.472
Now, the Bidoon only make up a fraction of the world’s stateless

00:22:05.472 --> 00:22:09.302
population, but their case is particularly interesting.

00:22:10.152 --> 00:22:15.722
They are not stateless because of a war or redrawing of national borders; they are

00:22:15.722 --> 00:22:20.962
stateless because their parents and grandparents never claimed a state when they could have.

00:22:22.302 --> 00:22:26.542
60 years later, the Bidoon of today are paying the price.

00:22:27.272 --> 00:22:31.612
They have slipped through all of the bureaucratic cracks, and exist,

00:22:32.022 --> 00:22:36.992
invisible, in the shadows of one of the richest countries in the world.

00:22:39.052 --> 00:22:42.855
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the Bidoon,

00:22:43.134 --> 00:22:47.222
the stateless citizens, or rather non-citizens, of Kuwait.

00:22:47.807 --> 00:22:50.717
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:22:51.157 --> 00:22:54.107
Are you from Kuwait, or from the Gulf region?

00:22:54.557 --> 00:22:58.437
If so, what do you think is the answer to the question of the Bidoon?

00:22:58.807 --> 00:23:01.817
Are there stateless people in your country, and what

00:23:01.857 --> 00:23:05.297
paths exist, if any, to giving them citizenship?

00:23:05.757 --> 00:23:09.257
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

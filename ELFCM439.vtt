Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.859
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.769
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.743
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something called “psychopomps”.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.919
The word “psychopomp” might be unfamiliar to you, it’s certainly not a common one in

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:37.499
English either, but it means someone who guides you in the afterlife, after you die.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.749
And in this episode we are going to talk about these people, these often

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.449
god-like figures, and how they have been interpreted through history.

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:52.022
On our journey we’ll travel through Ancient Egypt, Ancient

00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:56.534
Greece, Norse Mythology Hinduism and Middle Age Italy.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.491
We have a lot to get through, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:09.181
The Greek philosopher Socrates is once reported to have said, “To fear death is no other

00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:15.761
than to think oneself wise when one is not, to think one knows what one does not know.

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.881
No one knows whether death may not be the greatest of all blessings for

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:26.911
a man, yet men fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils.”

00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:33.961
In this quote, Socrates is reminding us that nobody knows what happens after

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:39.071
death, yet we fear it like it is the worst possible thing that can happen.

00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:46.131
If you are to take a purely atheist, non-believing perspective, and you would prefer to

00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:51.241
be alive than dead, then yes, surely death is the worst thing that can happen to you.

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:55.971
You die, nothing happens, and there is no possibility of return.

00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:57.491
It is not good news.

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.721
But if you have some kind of religious faith, perhaps

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:05.811
you believe that something happens after you die.

00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:11.481
Perhaps you will go to some kind of heaven, if you’ve led a good life, you will meet loved

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:16.801
ones, you might be changed into an animal of some sort, perhaps it will be marvellous.

00:02:18.095 --> 00:02:23.801
Perhaps you might not be so sure whether you’ve led a “good life”, and

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:28.781
you might be slightly nervous about what might happen to you after death.

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:34.861
As Socrates points out, even those with the most fervent of

00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:39.091
religious beliefs don’t claim to know exactly what will happen.

00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:45.591
Death is a leap into the unknown,  but if you believe that there is something

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.859
that awaits you after you take your last breath, you will no doubt be happy to

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.019
have someone guide you, to show you the way, to help you with the transition.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:02.549
These people, these figures, are called “psychopomps”, and many world religions

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.249
and belief systems have some form of guide of the afterlife who leads you and

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.899
helps you make the journey from the land of the living to the land of the dead.

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.879
Now, theoretical, or perhaps theological, part out of the way, let’s meet our first psychopomp.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.279
His name is Anubis, or Inpu in Ancient Egyptian.

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:28.849
You might be able to picture him.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.539
He looks like a man, but has a black dog’s head, with large pointy black ears.

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:43.269
His head is the head of a jackal, really, the sort of wolf-like dog native to Northern Africa.

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.679
And this gives us our first clue as to where Anubis is thought to have come from.

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:57.369
You’ll know that Ancient Egyptian pharaohs, the ancient kings, were buried in underground tombs

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.614
and at times under pyramids, but most people in Ancient Egypt didn’t get such a royal burial.

00:04:05.484 --> 00:04:11.234
They were buried in relatively shallow, underground graves, often only a few centimetres

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:17.860
underground, which meant that their bodies would be dug up by these hungry dogs and eaten.

00:04:18.662 --> 00:04:24.934
I know it's probably not a nice thought, but it leads us directly to the creation of Anubis.

00:04:25.795 --> 00:04:32.229
Because these jackals used to lurk around gravesites, eager for a fresh grave to be

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:38.279
dug and lunch to be waiting for them, these animals came to be associated with death.

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.399
So, in early Ancient Egypt, the god whose role was to be

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:47.509
a protector of graves was depicted as a fierce jackal.

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:52.949
After all, jackals were the threat, so what better

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.499
animal to fight off the jackals than another jackal?

00:04:57.758 --> 00:05:04.898
Now, as things progressed, this jackal god changed slightly, turning from a full

00:05:04.898 --> 00:05:10.878
jackal into a man with the head of a jackal, and his role also started to change.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:18.188
He was no longer merely the protector of graves; he was given several crucial psychopomp duties.

00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:24.188
His role was to help people cross from the realm of the living to

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:28.628
that of the dead, so when you died, he would be there waiting for you.

00:05:29.948 --> 00:05:35.398
He would then take you to the important next step, which would dictate what happened next.

00:05:36.608 --> 00:05:40.308
This was the weighing of the heart, where the heart of the

00:05:40.338 --> 00:05:45.198
dead person would be weighed against the feather of an ostrich.

00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:51.778
If the heart weighed more than an ostrich feather, the dead person

00:05:51.978 --> 00:05:56.923
would be eaten by Ammit, a terrible creature that had the back legs of a

00:05:56.928 --> 00:06:02.278
hippopotamus, the front legs and body of a lion, and the face of a crocodile.

00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:08.228
And, to state the obvious, you didn’t want to be eaten by Ammit, this was not good

00:06:08.228 --> 00:06:13.378
news at all, and meant that you would essentially die again, this time permanently.

00:06:14.838 --> 00:06:20.938
But, if your heart was lighter than the ostrich feather, this would mean that your soul

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:26.908
was pure and true, and Anubis would then guide you towards Ancient Egyptian heaven.

00:06:28.348 --> 00:06:33.278
Importantly, and this is going to be a theme with several of the psychopomps we’ll encounter,

00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:40.738
Anubis did not judge; he led the dead person to the scales and helped them make the journey.

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:48.528
He was neither good nor bad, he did not try to influence what happened, he was merely a helpful

00:06:48.528 --> 00:06:55.818
guide, but an essential one; without him, the dead person had no way of knowing where they needed

00:06:55.818 --> 00:07:01.028
to go, no way of getting to the weighing of the heart, and therefore no way of getting to heaven.

00:07:02.574 --> 00:07:05.744
Now, our next psychopomp is one that you will probably

00:07:05.744 --> 00:07:09.264
know if you are a fan of Greek myths, and that is Charon.

00:07:10.224 --> 00:07:15.204
Charon is the boatman of the Greek underworld, picking up the souls of the

00:07:15.204 --> 00:07:21.274
dead and carrying them across the River Acheron and River Styx in his boat.

00:07:22.404 --> 00:07:28.974
He was normally depicted as a grim, elderly man, or more as a skeletal

00:07:28.974 --> 00:07:33.294
figure, linking him closely to the idea of death and mortality.

00:07:34.824 --> 00:07:40.334
And of course crucial to the idea of Charon was the idea of travel, travelling

00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:46.354
from life to death, the known to the unknown, across the river in his boat.

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:53.154
Importantly, Charon’s service was not free, there was a fee to cross the river.

00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:58.814
And if you could not pay the fee, well Charon was not running a charity

00:07:58.814 --> 00:08:02.594
down there; he wouldn’t let you cross, the rules were the rules.

00:08:04.064 --> 00:08:08.544
In the Aeneid, Virgil describes what happened to people who didn’t have any money

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:14.234
to pay the fee, and that was the punishment of having to wait at the shore for a

00:08:14.234 --> 00:08:18.444
hundred years before they were allowed to cross the river and enter the underworld.

00:08:19.864 --> 00:08:25.964
And, as you may know, coins were often found in the burial sites of people in ancient Greece,

00:08:26.514 --> 00:08:32.124
and the reason archaeologists believe that people were buried with money was to pay Charon,

00:08:32.344 --> 00:08:38.724
the boatman, and avoid the fate of essentially being “stuck on the platform” for 100 years.

00:08:40.264 --> 00:08:44.414
Now, moving on to our next category of psychopomp, we are going to

00:08:44.444 --> 00:08:49.734
jump forward a few centuries, and go further north, to Scandinavia.

00:08:51.044 --> 00:08:54.834
And this category of psychopomp is a little different,

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:59.154
it will buck the trend, as they are all female.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:06.414
A valkyrie is a sort of female guide in Norse mythology who guides the

00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:10.884
souls of soldiers who have died in battle to the Norse heaven of “Valhalla”.

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:18.074
In fact, the Valkyries buck another trend because they are not merely non-judgmental

00:09:18.074 --> 00:09:24.734
guides; it is the role of the Valkyries to decide who dies in battle and who doesn’t.

00:09:26.134 --> 00:09:30.484
Now, you might be thinking that this makes them kind of nasty, evil,

00:09:30.484 --> 00:09:34.214
figures, if they are choosing who will live and who will die, but

00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:37.944
if that’s what you’re thinking, you are not thinking like a Viking.

00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:44.164
Remember that for a Viking warrior, almost the best thing that can happen is to

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:49.444
die a glorious death in battle, it’s something you look forward to, not fear.

00:09:51.114 --> 00:09:58.084
And the Valkyries decided who would die based on valour and prowess in battle; a viking

00:09:58.084 --> 00:10:03.384
warrior had to earn the right to die in battle, it was a reward, not a punishment.

00:10:04.024 --> 00:10:07.944
If a warrior was so lucky as to die in battle, this

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:10.594
was where the Valkyries really came into their own.

00:10:11.564 --> 00:10:17.074
They were beautiful, majestic women who rode on horseback, angel-like figures almost.

00:10:17.644 --> 00:10:22.874
They would descend on the battlefield and guide the souls of the fallen warriors

00:10:23.044 --> 00:10:28.854
towards Valhalla, the huge banqueting hall in Asgard, the home of the Norse gods.

00:10:29.784 --> 00:10:31.324
But that wasn’t it.

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:35.774
Upon arriving in Valhalla, Valkyries also played a role in

00:10:35.774 --> 00:10:39.754
welcoming and integrating the warriors into their new existence.

00:10:40.924 --> 00:10:46.334
This existence, this life in Valhalla, was essentially a non-stop feast and

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:51.674
battle, which would continue until something called Ragnarok, which is a huge

00:10:51.674 --> 00:10:56.584
battle in Norse mythology in which several important Norse gods die, there are

00:10:56.584 --> 00:11:02.194
huge fires and then a massive flood, the entire world is submerged underwater.

00:11:03.434 --> 00:11:07.424
If you ask me, Valhalla doesn’t exactly sound like heaven by

00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:10.754
my standards, but I am obviously not thinking like a Viking.

00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:15.584
Now, let’s move on to psychopomp number four, which is a

00:11:15.584 --> 00:11:18.844
very different kind of afterlife guide to the valkyries.

00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:25.894
Yama is a god that features prominently in both Hinduism and Buddhism, and

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:31.264
there are also similar characters in Iranian mythology and in Japanese culture.

00:11:32.644 --> 00:11:37.074
Now, because the character of Yama is so spread between cultures and

00:11:37.084 --> 00:11:42.494
religions, he varies greatly, but here are some of the key themes.

00:11:43.804 --> 00:11:49.724
In Hinduism, he is depicted as a fearsome deity with green or red

00:11:49.724 --> 00:11:55.388
skin, four arms, riding a buffalo and carrying various weapons.

00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:59.818
He isn’t the kind of person that I imagine you would particularly look forward to meeting

00:12:00.038 --> 00:12:05.918
after death, but it turns out that he has quite an important role to play, not just as a guide.

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:11.658
Unlike characters like Charon or Anubis, who do not judge

00:12:11.668 --> 00:12:16.168
and merely direct, Yama can decide where to send a soul.

00:12:17.248 --> 00:12:21.298
He is the lord of hell, but he can, if he so wishes,

00:12:21.598 --> 00:12:26.448
send a soul elsewhere; to purgatory or even to heaven.

00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:32.288
And after deciding where someone goes, he actually sends them there,

00:12:32.808 --> 00:12:36.378
fulfilling his important role as a psychopomp in those religions.

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:42.768
Now, our fifth and final psychopomp is the most important of all, the most

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:48.028
interesting, in my opinion, the best “guide”, and the father of all psychopomps.

00:12:48.998 --> 00:12:53.728
And he is also unique in that he is an example of how a

00:12:53.828 --> 00:12:58.528
historical figure can be reimagined as a psychopomp in literature.

00:12:59.837 --> 00:13:05.887
If you have read Dante’s Divine Comedy, La Divina Comedia, you will remember how Dante recounts

00:13:05.887 --> 00:13:12.947
his own journey through hell, purgatory and then heaven, and the characters he meets along the way.

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:19.890
It’s an epic poem, in every sense of the word, and it is also an epic journey.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.050
Of course, Dante was unable to make this journey on his own, so

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.460
his account called for a guide to the afterlife, a psychopomp.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:36.040
And we’ve actually already heard his name in this episode, it’s the Roman poet Virgil.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:41.220
Right at the start of Dante’s Inferno, “Hell”, he comes across

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.390
a man who he realises is one of his literary heroes, Virgil.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.700
Virgil is not in hell himself.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.620
I mean, he hasn’t been sent to hell, he has been sent down

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:58.350
from heaven specifically to guide Dante on this divine journey.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.910
And if you've read The Divine Comedy, you will know how much of a pivotal figure Virgil is,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.680
advising Dante on his journey, pointing out different people, and explaining different punishments.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:17.260
In fact, Virgil plays an important role before Dante even gets into hell proper.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.480
If you recall psychopomp number two, Charon, he also features in Dante’s Inferno.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:31.300
Dante and Virgil approach the river Acheron, but Charon refuses to carry Dante across.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.020
After all, Dante the character isn’t actually dead,

00:14:36.443 --> 00:14:39.300
and so he has no right to be taken across the river.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.590
It is only the intervention of Virgil, who tells Charon that Dante is on

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:49.110
a divine journey, that allows him to cross the river and start his voyage.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.950
And this is only the beginning.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:57.980
The other psychopomps we have talked about today have pretty specific roles, whether that be

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:03.660
the weighing the heart of a dead person or ferrying them from one side of a river to another.

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:09.000
Virgil’s role as a psychopomp is the most multi-faceted.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.060
He guides, he advises, he protects, and he explains.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.930
He is also used as a literary device by Dante the poet

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.660
to demonstrate things like the limits of human reason.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:29.490
Virgil is a pre-Christian character, so despite the fact that he represents the

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:34.940
pinnacle of classical human knowledge and wisdom, there are limits to his understanding.

00:15:36.219 --> 00:15:41.698
In other words, he’s used as a literary device to show that there are spiritual things

00:15:41.918 --> 00:15:46.788
that even the most intelligent people can not understand, if they do not have faith in God.

00:15:48.318 --> 00:15:52.798
And there we have it, a brief journey through time and myth,

00:15:53.038 --> 00:15:56.408
exploring the fascinating figures known as psychopomps.

00:15:57.128 --> 00:16:01.908
From the ancient tombs of Egypt to the ethereal realms of Valhalla, and from the judgement

00:16:01.918 --> 00:16:06.928
halls of Yama to the poetic guidance of Virgil, we've seen how different cultures and

00:16:06.928 --> 00:16:12.098
belief systems have grappled with the universal mystery of death and the afterlife.

00:16:13.568 --> 00:16:18.178
What's fascinating is how these guides of the afterlife, these psychopomps,

00:16:18.478 --> 00:16:23.008
though varied in their roles and origins, share a common purpose – to

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:28.108
escort us through the transition from life to whatever lies beyond.

00:16:29.568 --> 00:16:33.948
In learning about these figures, perhaps we can find some comfort in the

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:38.938
face of the unknown and recognise the shared human quest to understand

00:16:38.948 --> 00:16:44.048
life, death, and the mysteries that lie beyond our mortal understanding.

00:16:45.476 --> 00:16:51.244
OK then, that is it for today's episode this brief exploration of Psychopomps.

00:16:51.764 --> 00:16:54.144
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the episode.

00:16:54.494 --> 00:16:59.234
What other psychopomps, both spiritual and fictional, do you think we should have included?

00:16:59.824 --> 00:17:02.604
I'd love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

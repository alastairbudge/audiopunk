Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.529
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.790
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.380
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are talking about King Charles III.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.880
This is actually the second of a two-part mini-series about King Charles.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.020
In part one, which came out last week, we talked about his life and took a more

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.830
chronological approach to his long and patient journey to the British crown.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.919
Today, in part two, we are going to go a little deeper and

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.190
ask ourselves the question ‘Who Is The Real King Charles?’

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.540
Who is Charles the man, what life experiences have shaped his

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.901
character, and what will this mean for this reign as king?

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.911
So, let's get into it and talk about the real Charles III.

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:13.851
When he was a mere prince, Charles once remarked that “ As human beings, we suffer

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:19.471
from an innate tendency to jump to conclusions and to judge people too quickly”

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:27.071
It is, if I may say, an astute observation, something I’m sure most people would agree with.

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.851
And while we must try to not fall into the trap of judging people too

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:37.171
quickly here, in the case of King Charles, the British public has had over

00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:42.131
70 years of him being in the public eye, of him being known to the country.

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:48.461
These 70 years have provided us with some clues, some indications

00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:53.431
that might give us some idea about who Charles the man actually is.

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:59.111
So, in the next twenty minutes or so, we are going to try to unearth some

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:03.269
clues, to find some indications of the character of the British King.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.159
We must, of course, look at the question of nature vs.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:13.899
nurture, of how much of someone’s character is pre-built, is genetic, vs.

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:18.866
how much of it can be understood through their upbringing and lived experiences.

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:24.266
And within the question of nurture, we must look at the experiences that

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:29.616
Charles went through to try to ask ourselves how they might have affected him.

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:34.446
As with anyone, it’s helpful to start at the beginning, to

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:38.812
try to understand how he grew up and the childhood he had.

00:02:39.742 --> 00:02:43.742
This, clearly, touches on nature and nurture, though

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:47.592
as you will see, there wasn’t all that much nurture.

00:02:48.762 --> 00:02:53.002
Firstly, clearly, it’s almost impossible for any heir to the

00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:57.242
throne to have anything remotely resembling a normal childhood.

00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:01.752
As soon as Charles could understand who his parents were,

00:03:02.222 --> 00:03:05.304
he would have known that he was destined to become king.

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:11.474
In some respects, however, his parents did try to give the young

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:15.664
boy as normal a childhood as a monarch-in-waiting could have.

00:03:16.974 --> 00:03:22.944
You may remember from part one that the young Charles was the first heir apparent, that is, the

00:03:23.214 --> 00:03:29.344
first next in line to the throne, to go to school, as opposed to being tutored privately at home.

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.709
The school Charles went to wasn’t a normal school, of course, it was an

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.699
exclusive boarding school in the north of Scotland called Gordonstoun.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:47.379
The school had a focus on the outdoors, and on outdoor physical activity.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.789
Prince Phillip had suggested Charles was sent to this school

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.999
precisely because of its reputation for being a tough school.

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:01.229
He thought his son was too sensitive and soft, and thought

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.639
going to Gordonstoun would toughen the young boy up.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.429
When Charles arrived, teachers and students were instructed not to treat

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.685
the young prince any differently, and to not give him any special treatment.

00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:19.735
And they certainly didn’t.

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:25.475
In fact, he was beaten up and bullied, and Charles would later admit

00:04:25.615 --> 00:04:30.165
that he hated his time there, and longed to return to his family.

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:35.215
See, this school was a terrible choice for Charles.

00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:39.955
His father was right, that he was a sensitive young boy, someone

00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:44.945
more at home reading books or painting than fighting with other boys.

00:04:45.855 --> 00:04:49.607
But his father was certainly wrong about this being a good

00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:53.547
choice of school for Charles, who hated every minute of it.

00:04:54.352 --> 00:05:01.204
It was just one of many examples of there being a strained relationship between father and son.

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:07.234
The two men had very different characters: Charles was sensitive,

00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:12.774
Prince Phillip was very traditional and, in his own words “unfeeling”.

00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:18.984
Prince Phillip made no secret of his preference for his daughter, Anne, who

00:05:19.174 --> 00:05:24.573
liked outdoor sports, was more tough and was more similar to her father.

00:05:26.134 --> 00:05:29.714
To Prince Phillip, his eldest son was a disappointment.

00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:35.784
His father’s disappointment in him is thought to have been one of the reasons that Charles

00:05:35.784 --> 00:05:41.714
took active steps to try to engage in more “rough and tumble” activities, such as polo.

00:05:42.814 --> 00:05:48.524
If you don’t know, polo is a ball game played on horseback where each team must

00:05:48.574 --> 00:05:54.174
use a long wooden mallet, or stick, to hit a ball into the opposing team's goal.

00:05:54.964 --> 00:06:00.484
It is a very elitist sport, and is one only really played by the upper classes.

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:07.294
Charles embraced this unusual sport and was often photographed on horseback.

00:06:08.294 --> 00:06:11.864
Some have said that this was to impress his rough-and-ready father,

00:06:12.314 --> 00:06:16.724
to show that yes, Charles was a real man, he played this tough sport.

00:06:18.034 --> 00:06:23.684
Others have suggested that his reasons for taking up this sport went beyond his father,

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:29.774
and in fact it was to show the country that he was a powerful young king in waiting.

00:06:30.884 --> 00:06:35.154
It seems likely that there was some truth in both of these theories.

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:40.464
In one respect, taking up the sport was Charles' way of reaching out to

00:06:40.474 --> 00:06:45.354
his father, of trying to understand him and showing him that they could

00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:49.524
connect in the same way, that Charles could be more like his sister, Anne.

00:06:50.954 --> 00:06:57.014
In the other, it was Charles’ way of trying to establish his own legacy, to fight the

00:06:57.014 --> 00:07:03.104
preconceived notion that he was someone who preferred intellectual pursuits over physical ones.

00:07:04.154 --> 00:07:08.274
And polo was far from his only physical outdoor hobby.

00:07:08.924 --> 00:07:15.624
He went fox hunting, shooting, and fishing, and threw himself into these outdoor pursuits,

00:07:15.804 --> 00:07:21.494
making him more like a 15th-century prince than someone born in the 20th century.

00:07:22.694 --> 00:07:27.234
But none of this would seem to endear him to his parents.

00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:32.584
His relationship with his father showed few signs of improving, and

00:07:32.854 --> 00:07:37.894
his mother, the queen, had her own favourite, her third son, Andrew.

00:07:39.014 --> 00:07:42.904
If you’re wondering, yes, this is the same Andrew who is now

00:07:43.084 --> 00:07:47.284
somewhat disgraced, but she was the queen’s “golden boy”.

00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:51.634
Again, this is thought to come down to Charles’ character.

00:07:52.374 --> 00:07:57.784
The queen found Charles to be, as she said, “emotionally complicated”, whereas

00:07:57.784 --> 00:08:02.364
Andrew, she felt, could “make her laugh and raise the family’s spirits.”

00:08:03.534 --> 00:08:07.656
But the Queen’s preference for her second son over her first

00:08:07.874 --> 00:08:11.243
wasn’t only because of the two men's different characters.

00:08:12.123 --> 00:08:15.663
Commentators have suggested that a lot of it is to do

00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:18.973
with the fact that Charles is 11 years older than Andrew.

00:08:20.443 --> 00:08:25.923
For much of Charles’ early life, his mother had been away, she was absent.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:32.603
He was three years old when his mother became queen, and he rarely saw her when he was growing up.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:39.855
And when he did see his parents, it was an unusual and unaffectionate relationship.

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:48.165
In one famous episode, when the queen and Prince Phillip returned to the UK after 6 months away on

00:08:48.165 --> 00:08:55.955
a tour, they greeted the five-year-old Charles not with a hug or a big kiss, but with a handshake.

00:08:56.725 --> 00:09:01.688
So, his relationship with his parents was distant, unaffectionate, and

00:09:01.868 --> 00:09:06.228
always inferior compared to their relationship with their other children.

00:09:07.238 --> 00:09:11.188
For a sensitive young boy, this must not have been easy.

00:09:12.468 --> 00:09:19.241
With absent parents, Charles was far closer to his great-uncle, the 1st Earl Mountbatten.

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:23.888
Mountbatten began to nurture the young Charles, allowing

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:27.208
him to show his sensitive side and speak his mind.

00:09:28.188 --> 00:09:32.038
Charles, reportedly, felt comfortable enough to cry in front of

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:35.811
him, something he would never have done in front of his own father.

00:09:37.031 --> 00:09:42.398
But in 1979, Mountbatten was assassinated by the IRA.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:49.061
Just like that, this guiding influence in the young man’s life, his confidant, was no more.

00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:55.641
As you might imagine, it affected him greatly, and for months Charles

00:09:55.641 --> 00:09:59.471
couldn’t talk about his beloved great-uncle without breaking down in tears.

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:03.851
By this time, Charles was in his early thirties.

00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:10.411
He had been playing around, dating women, for several years, and it was time to find a wife.

00:10:11.671 --> 00:10:17.821
The wife was, as you’ll know, Lady Diana Spencer, a woefully bad match for Charles.

00:10:18.701 --> 00:10:22.501
Now, what does the choice of Diana, and his behaviour

00:10:22.511 --> 00:10:26.371
during his marriage to Diana, tell us about Charles the man?

00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:31.221
Perhaps it tells us that he has a strong sense of duty.

00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:35.801
He knew that he needed to find someone to produce an heir, someone

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:40.101
to be his queen, and Diana had all of the relevant qualities.

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:44.651
She was young, she was beautiful, and she looked like a princess.

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.231
And most importantly, she would give him a child.

00:10:49.381 --> 00:10:55.621
So, Charles moved quickly, with the pair only meeting 13 times before their wedding day.

00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:01.610
Perhaps you have a story of true love, where you only met your partner a handful

00:11:01.743 --> 00:11:06.973
of times before getting hitched, getting married, and living happily ever after.

00:11:07.743 --> 00:11:09.433
If so, great, well done.

00:11:10.663 --> 00:11:14.903
For Charles and Diana, as you’ll know, it wasn’t a story of true love.

00:11:16.033 --> 00:11:19.893
But perhaps, to Charles, this didn’t matter.

00:11:20.403 --> 00:11:24.983
It didn’t matter if he hardly knew her and didn’t love her, that was

00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:29.913
secondary, this marriage was a transaction on behalf of the country.

00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:37.133
After all, his true love was another woman, Camilla Shand, who by now was Camilla Parker-Bowles.

00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:41.333
You could interpret this as showing some great sense

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:44.756
of  duty, putting his country’s needs above his own.

00:11:45.754 --> 00:11:51.196
But to others, it suggests selfishness, that he brought this young girl into the

00:11:51.196 --> 00:11:56.566
limelight, and put her on the front page of every newspaper, knowing full well that it

00:11:56.566 --> 00:12:01.986
would be a loveless marriage and her role was to produce an heir and look glamorous.

00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:09.356
And his behaviour as a parent did nothing to dispel, to get rid of, these

00:12:09.386 --> 00:12:14.036
accusations of selfishness, of putting himself before his wife and children.

00:12:15.246 --> 00:12:19.246
For example, in 1991, the young Prince William had

00:12:19.246 --> 00:12:22.426
an accident when a friend hit him with a golf club.

00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:29.206
The then nine-year-old, who still has the scar to this day, needed 24 stitches.

00:12:30.196 --> 00:12:31.846
But what did Charles do?

00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:38.386
After going to see his young son, he left to attend a function after less than an hour.

00:12:39.486 --> 00:12:44.046
This was observed by the British press, of course, and fueled tabloid

00:12:44.056 --> 00:12:48.727
speculation that the future King was a selfish man and uncommitted father.

00:12:49.597 --> 00:12:53.037
Then there were the revelations of his and Camilla’s affair,

00:12:53.227 --> 00:12:57.557
his subsequent divorce from Diana, and her death a year later.

00:12:58.567 --> 00:13:03.927
Charles was a villain, his popularity with the British public at rock bottom.

00:13:04.827 --> 00:13:09.181
And whatever Charles did, there were accusations of hypocrisy.

00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:13.621
He would try to put forward the image of a simple man with

00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:17.681
simple pleasures: the outdoors, gardening, and nature.

00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:23.061
Yet there were reports that one of his valets, his servants, was

00:13:23.061 --> 00:13:27.275
required to squeeze out his toothpaste onto his toothbrush every night.

00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:32.359
Similarly, he said he had simple tastes, only having

00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:35.339
a simple boiled egg for breakfast every morning.

00:13:35.819 --> 00:13:40.609
Yet his standards for this simple boiled egg are reported to be so

00:13:40.609 --> 00:13:45.179
high that it needs to be cooked to perfection, and the cook always

00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:49.899
boils several eggs in case the first one is rejected by his master.

00:13:51.081 --> 00:13:57.731
Now, one area where it is perhaps harder to fault Charles is his commitment to the environment.

00:13:58.521 --> 00:14:04.041
Charles has long been an advocate for green issues, and it’s fair to say

00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:08.211
he was certainly ahead of the curve on this one, or ahead of his time.

00:14:08.821 --> 00:14:15.241
As early as the 1970s, when he was just 21 years old, Charles was making speeches about

00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:20.861
pollution, and he has been a keen environmental campaigner ever since he was a young man.

00:14:22.071 --> 00:14:26.581
But even when it comes to his environmental credentials, there are plenty of

00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:31.421
reports over the years that have shown Charles to be a man who doesn’t always

00:14:31.681 --> 00:14:35.911
practise what he preaches - that is, that he is somewhat of a hypocrite.

00:14:37.251 --> 00:14:43.011
He has a large collection of gas-guzzling cars, and travels all around the world on private planes.

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:50.331
So, to try to bring this back to the question at hand, Who is the real King Charles III?

00:14:51.091 --> 00:14:53.471
His character is one of contradictions.

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:58.391
A sensitive man who tried to develop a macho image.

00:14:58.711 --> 00:15:02.387
A man with both a reputation as an environmentalist

00:15:02.577 --> 00:15:05.847
and an expensive collection of gas-guzzling cars.

00:15:06.297 --> 00:15:10.148
What does this mean that we, the public, should think about him?

00:15:11.128 --> 00:15:17.528
On the one hand, he is the king, and he should be held to higher standards than normal citizens.

00:15:18.098 --> 00:15:22.668
I say this both from the point of view of a functional constitutional monarchy

00:15:22.668 --> 00:15:27.276
more generally,  and from the point of view of the longevity of the monarchy.

00:15:28.156 --> 00:15:32.196
In other words, if Charles wants the monarchy to remain popular, he

00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:36.076
needs to hold himself to the same high standards as his mother did.

00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:44.786
But on the other hand, on a human level, Charles has had a very unusual and not very happy life.

00:15:45.606 --> 00:15:50.816
Sure, it was far from difficult in the sense that he has huge houses,

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:55.046
servants, and access to any material possession he might choose.

00:15:55.946 --> 00:16:01.236
But on an emotional level, he had an unhappy childhood with absent

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:05.436
parents, both of whom clearly preferred another one of his siblings.

00:16:05.976 --> 00:16:10.786
He was not allowed to marry the woman he loved and ended up in a loveless marriage.

00:16:11.436 --> 00:16:17.386
And he constantly lived in the shadow of his mother, a hugely popular woman and queen.

00:16:18.536 --> 00:16:24.046
Of course, I am not saying that we should pity Charles Philip Arthur George Mountbatten-Windsor.

00:16:24.496 --> 00:16:28.956
But simply acknowledge the bizarre situation of his life, and

00:16:29.116 --> 00:16:33.056
recognise the impact that this must surely have on a person.

00:16:33.998 --> 00:16:39.026
To have emerged from this unhappy and unusual life lived under a magnifying

00:16:39.026 --> 00:16:44.716
glass and still manage to have a half-decent reputation is somewhat of a triumph.

00:16:45.776 --> 00:16:50.086
And on this note, he is now more popular than ever before.

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:56.026
More than a quarter of British people say that their opinion of him has improved

00:16:56.176 --> 00:17:01.646
since he became king, and 58% of people say that they think he’ll be a good king.

00:17:02.886 --> 00:17:06.606
As a sensitive man who is acutely aware of his public

00:17:06.606 --> 00:17:10.186
perception, this must surely give him some reassurance.

00:17:11.269 --> 00:17:17.069
So, we’ve learned about Charles the man - a sensitive character with an unhappy

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:23.289
childhood, a man of contradictions, a man perhaps unsure of who he wants to be.

00:17:24.399 --> 00:17:27.209
What does this mean for his reign as king?

00:17:27.939 --> 00:17:33.080
Well, a strange contradiction is that as king, he will have much

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.420
less opportunity to have an influence and show his true character.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.800
As Prince Charles, he enjoyed some freedom to speak his

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.900
mind, to try to influence opinion and to get his way.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.220
As King Charles, he will not enjoy these freedoms.

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:58.720
His mother’s huge popularity came in part from her never interfering with the running of

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.340
the country, never showing anyone her opinion, and never revealing what she really thought.

00:18:04.964 --> 00:18:07.738
It will certainly be a tough adjustment.

00:18:08.468 --> 00:18:14.858
But king he is, and he has had more than enough time to think about the kind of king he wants to be.

00:18:15.698 --> 00:18:21.408
Only time will tell how much of the “real” Charles we will see now he is King.

00:18:24.068 --> 00:18:30.358
Ok then, that’s it for today’s episode - the second in our two-part special on King Charles III.

00:18:30.698 --> 00:18:34.488
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you are a huge fan of the Royal

00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:38.978
Family and knew a lot about Charles’ character, or this mini-series was the

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:42.928
first time you’d heard much about him, well I hope you learned something new.

00:18:43.798 --> 00:18:47.148
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:47.568 --> 00:18:50.818
What type of man do you think Charles really is?

00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:53.122
How will that affect  him as King?

00:18:53.502 --> 00:18:54.902
Do you think he’ll be a good King?

00:18:55.382 --> 00:18:58.642
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

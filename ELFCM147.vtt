Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.990
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.400
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.090
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Death of God’s Banker.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.260
It's a fascinating story that links the Vatican City, the Mafia, a masonic lodge,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.000
London, the most powerful figures in Italian business and finance, and the Pope.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.900
The story is one of suicide or murder, of corruption, of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.930
money laundering, and of one family’s hunt for the truth.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.120
It is also, I should add, an ongoing one, the mystery has yet to be solved.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.410
So, I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.560
Our story starts on the morning of June the 18th, 1982, in London.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.480
As you may know, the river Thames runs through the centre of London dividing north and south.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.275
A young postal clerk was on his way to work, and was walking across one of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.350
the bridges that stretch over the river, a bridge called Blackfriars bridge.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.220
London on an early June morning can be beautiful and crisp, the sun rising to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.540
the east, and a beautiful light shining over the city, reflecting off the river.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.140
But, that morning the postal clerk was to make a gruesome discovery.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.110
Hanging from under Blackfriars Bridge was the body of a man.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.823
He was dressed in a dark grey suit, a white waistcoat, and a blue striped shirt.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.050
Around his neck hung a bright orange rope.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.340
The postal clerk called the police, who rushed to the scene and took down the body.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.050
As they lay him down, they found bricks in his pockets, weighing him down.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.970
In his wallet, they found the equivalent of $15,000 in three different currencies.

00:02:26.695 --> 00:02:32.436
There was also an Italian passport with the name, Gian Roberto Calvini.

00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:37.334
The dead man's face matched the face of the man in the

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:42.787
passport, but the dead man’s name wasn’t Gian Roberto Calvini.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.579
The passport was a fake.

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:49.309
Within a few days, his body was identified.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.449
His name was Roberto Calvi.

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:59.084
He was the ex-chairman of one of Italy’s largest private banks, and had

00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:04.583
disappeared from his apartment in Rome on June 10th, eight days before.

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:12.287
The British police ruled that his death was a suicide, that Calvi had killed himself.

00:03:13.237 --> 00:03:19.177
But ever since the gruesome discovery, people have been trying to figure out what really

00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:25.937
happened, and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that his death was far from suicide.

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:32.767
To understand why the police thought Roberto Calvi did kill himself, and why

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:38.237
his family thought he didn’t, we need to take a little trip down memory lane.

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:46.867
Roberto Calvi had joined a small private bank called Banco Ambrosiano shortly after the end of

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:56.017
World War II, and he had worked his way up, becoming the boss of the entire organisation by 1975.

00:03:56.997 --> 00:04:02.587
He was known as a shrewd, trustworthy and clever banker, and

00:04:02.607 --> 00:04:06.707
cultivated strong relationships with the clients of the bank.

00:04:07.907 --> 00:04:12.267
When he joined the bank it was a small organisation that didn’t

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:17.347
do anything one might consider risky, adventurous or dodgy.

00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:27.347
But as Calvi rose through its ranks, he expanded the bank, opening offshore branches in places like

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:34.967
Luxembourg, and the Caribbean, offshore banking centres not known for their transparency, not places

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:41.377
where banks generally have branches if they are squeaky clean, if they are completely innocent.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:49.327
Calvi’s Banco Ambrosiano had developed strong links with the Vatican, and Calvi was

00:04:49.387 --> 00:04:56.337
nicknamed God’s Banker, given the amount of trust placed in him by the Catholic Church.

00:04:57.557 --> 00:05:04.227
Initially, it wasn’t quite clear exactly what business Banco Ambrosiano was conducting.

00:05:05.057 --> 00:05:09.257
Calvi was borrowing large amounts of money and then giving

00:05:09.277 --> 00:05:12.767
it out as loans to companies based in the Caribbean.

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:19.777
In order to distribute these loans, he was given letters directly from the Vatican,

00:05:20.263 --> 00:05:26.657
implying that the Vatican either owned these companies or supported them in some way.

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:32.432
These letters came directly from a man called Paul Marcinkus.

00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:39.687
Marcinkus was a senior American priest, and was nicknamed The Pope’s Bodyguard.

00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:47.237
But most importantly for our story, he was also the head of the Vatican City’s own

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:53.387
bank, something called Istituto per le opere di religione, The Institute for Religious

00:05:53.387 --> 00:06:00.087
Works, which manages the bank accounts of both the church itself, and its priests.

00:06:00.717 --> 00:06:06.397
Now, The Vatican Bank is still a very mysterious institution, and

00:06:06.577 --> 00:06:11.527
40 years ago, when our story takes place, it was even more so.

00:06:12.476 --> 00:06:18.246
Because of the Vatican’s status as an independent self-governing city state,

00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:23.866
it didn’t have to show anyone what was going on at its bank, so there was no

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:27.586
central authority that could say “hey, we’d like to look at your accounts”.

00:06:28.756 --> 00:06:34.746
It would also accept deposits in cash, so there was often no paper

00:06:34.746 --> 00:06:40.176
trail of where money had come from before it was deposited at the bank.

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:45.899
A client of the Vatican Bank could turn up with cash or other

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:50.570
assets, and simply deposit them, with very minimal questions asked.

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:57.909
There have been multiple investigations into the Vatican Bank, with it being accused of being

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:05.459
a front, of being a cover, for laundering money for everyone from the Mafia to the Nazis.

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:11.901
And Marcinkus ran the show, he had been in charge of it since 1971.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:18.669
Marcinkus and Calvi cultivated a strong working relationship, and it’s believed that

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:24.459
Calvi offered The Vatican access to investment opportunities through Banco Ambrosiano.

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:31.049
Unfortunately, Calvi’s Banco Ambrosiano wasn’t immune from investigation, it was

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:36.519
an Italian bank, and the Italian authorities had the right to look at its accounts.

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:40.454
When they did, it turned out that Banco Ambrosiano

00:07:40.609 --> 00:07:44.709
was no longer a small, clean Italian private bank.

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:52.559
In 1981 the Italian authorities found out that the bank had been engaging in illegal

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:58.739
foreign currency transactions, that they had bought and sold $50 million worth of

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:04.249
Italian lire without informing the Bank of Italy, which they were legally required to do.

00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:11.142
Calvi was thrown into prison, and while he was awaiting trial he tried to kill himself.

00:08:12.222 --> 00:08:16.552
He insisted that he was innocent, and his wife said that he had

00:08:16.622 --> 00:08:21.042
actually made these transactions on behalf of the Vatican Bank.

00:08:21.842 --> 00:08:27.672
But these illegal currency transactions were really just the tip of the iceberg.

00:08:28.672 --> 00:08:32.982
As the authorities looked more closely at the activities of Banco

00:08:32.982 --> 00:08:38.292
Ambrosiano, they found all sorts of irregular transactions, of money

00:08:38.382 --> 00:08:43.172
moving all over the world, being loaned out to unexpected places.

00:08:44.212 --> 00:08:49.482
Calvi had borrowed money denominated in dollars, and then sent it

00:08:49.502 --> 00:08:53.782
to other Banco Ambrosiano branches in places like the Caribbean.

00:08:54.632 --> 00:09:00.249
After that, it was lent out to non-existent companies, companies that existed

00:09:00.404 --> 00:09:05.612
only as a letterbox, and were used to move money all around the world.

00:09:06.582 --> 00:09:10.372
It was many of these companies that were guaranteed by letters

00:09:10.382 --> 00:09:14.612
of support from Paul Marcinkus, the head of The Vatican Bank.

00:09:15.532 --> 00:09:22.762
When the US dollar increased in value against the Italian Lira starting in 1980, and interest

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:29.922
rates increased, the amount of interest that Calvi was required to pay increased dramatically.

00:09:30.812 --> 00:09:34.782
Calvi wasn’t able to pay back the interest on these loans.

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:39.204
The Italian currency was getting weaker and weaker,

00:09:39.817 --> 00:09:43.827
and the entire house of cards had started to collapse.

00:09:45.097 --> 00:09:50.177
These loans totalled between 1.2 and 1.4 billion dollars

00:09:50.177 --> 00:09:54.897
at the time, which is about $3.5 billion in today’s money.

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:59.277
Calvi must have been desperate - the bank he had spent

00:09:59.287 --> 00:10:03.027
his career building was collapsing in front of his eyes.

00:10:03.977 --> 00:10:10.217
On June 5th 1982, Calvi wrote to Pope John Paul II appealing for help,

00:10:10.517 --> 00:10:15.087
telling him he was his last hope to stop the bank from imploding,

00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:20.062
and that the Vatican would also suffer if Banco Ambrosiano failed.

00:10:20.862 --> 00:10:26.712
Not only did The Vatican own a substantial part of Banco Ambrosiano, but Banco

00:10:26.842 --> 00:10:32.402
Ambrosiano was one of the original Catholic banks, and was a known favourite of The

00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:38.462
Vatican’s - it would certainly not reflect well on the Vatican if it were allowed to fail.

00:10:39.322 --> 00:10:42.492
But the pope didn’t respond to Calvi’s letter.

00:10:43.641 --> 00:10:49.212
Three days later, on June 8th, Roberto Calvi was stripped of his position as

00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:55.282
chairman of the bank, he was in effect sacked, when the directors on the board

00:10:55.312 --> 00:11:00.032
of the bank agreed to cooperate with the investigations of the Bank of Italy.

00:11:00.932 --> 00:11:05.172
Two days after that, on June 10th, his driver dropped

00:11:05.172 --> 00:11:09.132
him off at his apartment in central Rome at around 9pm.

00:11:10.092 --> 00:11:13.112
When the driver returned the following morning, Calvi

00:11:13.192 --> 00:11:16.872
was nowhere to be found, and his apartment was empty.

00:11:17.912 --> 00:11:22.422
He was next seen hanging from a bridge in London, 8 days later.

00:11:23.262 --> 00:11:28.142
Now, one could of course say that Calvi had every reason to kill himself.

00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:32.582
His bank was collapsing before his eyes, and he knew

00:11:32.742 --> 00:11:35.312
that there was very little that he could do to stop it.

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:40.402
We now know that Calvi had spent most of his time in London on the

00:11:40.402 --> 00:11:45.812
phone, trying furiously to find ways to save it, but to no avail.

00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:52.942
Was it completely beyond the realms of possibility that this desperate man, who

00:11:52.942 --> 00:11:58.242
had lost billions of dollars of his clients’ money, would decide to end it all?

00:11:59.182 --> 00:12:04.182
Perhaps not, but Calvi’s family certainly never believed that he killed himself.

00:12:05.022 --> 00:12:08.742
Why would he have gone to London if he knew he wanted to kill himself?

00:12:09.402 --> 00:12:15.282
And why did he telephone his family repeatedly telling them that it would all be ok?

00:12:16.162 --> 00:12:22.342
They also knew that he suffered terribly from vertigo - that he was really afraid of heights.

00:12:22.752 --> 00:12:26.764
If he really wanted to kill himself, surely climbing down from

00:12:26.764 --> 00:12:29.574
a bridge would have been the last way he would have done it?

00:12:30.604 --> 00:12:37.314
It took almost a decade, but 10 years later the Calvi family hired an investigative

00:12:37.354 --> 00:12:43.534
company to try and find out the truth, and some curious truths emerged.

00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:49.024
Firstly, they discovered that Calvi didn’t get under the bridge from the

00:12:49.024 --> 00:12:54.004
road, he must have been taken there by a boat, from underneath the bridge.

00:12:54.834 --> 00:13:01.854
They found this out as there was scaffolding under the bridge that had been recently painted yellow.

00:13:02.664 --> 00:13:08.764
They proved that if Calvi had climbed down to where he was found, he would have had

00:13:08.764 --> 00:13:14.174
to have gone over the scaffolding, and he would have got yellow paint on his shoes.

00:13:15.184 --> 00:13:18.564
When Calvi was found, there was no paint on his shoes.

00:13:19.704 --> 00:13:23.424
And the bricks that were in his pockets to weigh him down?

00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:29.124
There was no dust from the bricks on Calvi’s fingers, so he hadn’t put them there.

00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:35.974
And when they dug up his body and examined it again, they saw that the marks

00:13:35.994 --> 00:13:41.424
on his neck weren’t just from the orange ropes, someone had strangled him.

00:13:42.524 --> 00:13:46.554
So, if Calvi didn’t kill himself, who killed him?

00:13:47.684 --> 00:13:51.354
As the investigations continued, more and more people

00:13:51.554 --> 00:13:55.264
emerged with possible motives to have killed Calvi.

00:13:56.254 --> 00:14:01.714
He had dirt on some of Italy’s most powerful people, and had actually

00:14:01.714 --> 00:14:07.534
travelled to London with a briefcase full of documents, a briefcase Calvi

00:14:07.544 --> 00:14:12.784
considered so precious that he reportedly slept with it while in London.

00:14:13.654 --> 00:14:20.564
That briefcase was never found in London, but then magically it appeared on an Italian TV

00:14:20.564 --> 00:14:28.884
show in 1986, with a fake Nicaraguan passport, but funnily enough, no incriminating documents.

00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:32.644
There are several theories about who killed him.

00:14:33.144 --> 00:14:36.844
The most prominent of which is that he was murdered by the mafia.

00:14:37.434 --> 00:14:44.599
It’s believed that he was laundering vast amounts of money for the mafia through Banco Ambrosiano.

00:14:45.114 --> 00:14:49.144
When it was clear that the bank was going bankrupt and that

00:14:49.164 --> 00:14:52.854
their money had been lost, Calvi was killed for two reasons.

00:14:53.464 --> 00:14:56.284
Firstly, as revenge for losing their money.

00:14:56.764 --> 00:15:00.714
And secondly, as a preventative measure to stop him from talking.

00:15:01.774 --> 00:15:07.204
Calvi was desperate, he knew far too much about the mafia’s business dealings,

00:15:07.314 --> 00:15:12.004
and he was murdered so that he would take these secrets to the grave with him.

00:15:12.914 --> 00:15:17.664
Indeed, in 2005 five people with links to the mafia

00:15:17.824 --> 00:15:22.104
were put on trial in Italy, accused of his murder.

00:15:23.024 --> 00:15:27.244
Two years later, they were all cleared of the charges, with the

00:15:27.304 --> 00:15:30.824
judge saying that there wasn’t enough evidence to convict them.

00:15:31.724 --> 00:15:36.684
There was little doubt that he had been murdered, and the working theory was that

00:15:36.684 --> 00:15:41.854
the mafia had done it to shut him up, but there was not enough evidence to prove it.

00:15:43.244 --> 00:15:47.294
That the mafia did kill Calvi might be the correct answer, but

00:15:47.414 --> 00:15:51.514
it hasn’t stopped others from proposing alternative theories.

00:15:52.144 --> 00:15:55.704
The finger was pointed directly at the Vatican, and at the

00:15:55.704 --> 00:16:00.374
head of the bank and close associate of Calvi, Paul Marcinkus.

00:16:01.524 --> 00:16:06.964
But he was never allowed to be brought in for questioning, because he was protected by the Vatican.

00:16:07.664 --> 00:16:13.806
He died in 2006,  taking whatever knowledge he had of Calvi’s death with him.

00:16:14.936 --> 00:16:18.642
There’s also the theory that the Freemasons’ were involved.

00:16:19.716 --> 00:16:26.556
Calvi was a member of a right-wing Masonic lodge called Propaganda Due, P2, whose members

00:16:26.586 --> 00:16:33.206
included some of the most powerful men in Italy, people at the top of the world of politics,

00:16:33.356 --> 00:16:40.106
finance, business and the police, including the ex Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:44.756
The members of this lodge referred to themselves as

00:16:44.896 --> 00:16:48.986
‘frati neri’, ‘Black brothers’, or ‘Black friars’.

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:54.236
And can you remember the name of the bridge under which Calvi was found hanging?

00:16:55.126 --> 00:16:57.056
It was Blackfriars bridge.

00:16:58.166 --> 00:17:01.676
Calvi was staying in a hotel in Chelsea, in west London.

00:17:02.111 --> 00:17:06.416
Blackfriars Bridge is in the east of the city, nowhere near Chelsea.

00:17:06.946 --> 00:17:11.886
It made no sense for Calvi to have gone all the way to that bridge to kill

00:17:11.886 --> 00:17:17.636
himself, and so people have questioned whether the location of his murder was a

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:23.859
sign that the crime was committed by the Masonic lodge, by Propaganda Due, by P2.

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:32.069
It has been hypothesised that P2 had used Banco Ambrosiano to transfer money to right-wing

00:17:32.069 --> 00:17:38.229
causes it supported around the world, such as financing dictators in Latin and South America.

00:17:39.129 --> 00:17:44.619
And Calvi was murdered so that he wouldn’t be able to tell anyone where this money

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:50.719
had gone, or more importantly, which members of P2 had ordered for this to be done.

00:17:51.729 --> 00:17:57.229
Although it is easy to get caught up in these kinds of conspiracy theories, the decision

00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:02.689
to leave Calvi under Blackfriars bridge, of all the bridges in London, does seem...

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.589
unusual.

00:18:04.439 --> 00:18:09.259
The reality is that many of the people who were accused of either

00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:13.479
ordering or actually committing the murder are now dead themselves.

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:19.019
Paul Marcinkus, the head of the Vatican Bank, died in 2006.

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:23.439
Two gangsters who were accused of actually killing him,

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:27.099
Vaccari and Vincenzo Casillo, were murdered in Naples.

00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:32.689
Licio Gelli, the head of Propaganda Due, died in 2015.

00:18:33.569 --> 00:18:38.779
And the remaining mafiosi, the ones that are still alive, are in their

00:18:38.779 --> 00:18:43.209
late 80s and 90s, they have managed to keep quiet for the past 40

00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:47.199
years, and they will no doubt take their secrets to the grave with them.

00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:54.959
And if that does happen, it seems like the mystery of who killed God’s Banker will never be solved.

00:18:57.969 --> 00:19:02.059
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Death of God’s

00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:06.619
Banker, and the mystery of what actually happened to Roberto Calvi.

00:19:07.269 --> 00:19:10.369
If you did enjoy it, then I think you will probably enjoy

00:19:10.629 --> 00:19:15.069
episode 63, which is on The Disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi.

00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:18.909
That is another fascinating story involving the disappearance

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:22.029
of a young girl from right at the heart of the Vatican.

00:19:23.319 --> 00:19:26.319
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:26.609 --> 00:19:31.839
Especially for the Italian members among you, do you remember the case of Roberto Calvi?

00:19:32.389 --> 00:19:33.309
Who do you think

00:19:33.319 --> 00:19:34.319
was behind his death?

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:36.219
I would love to know.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.213 --> 00:00:16.803
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:20.963
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:25.673
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:30.213
Dolly the Sheep, probably the most famous sheep in the world.

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:36.663
25 years ago this year, in 1997, a small research institute in

00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:42.343
Scotland announced that it had cloned a sheep from a single adult cell.

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:50.693
The birth of Dolly was groundbreaking for many reasons, and it gave rise to both fear and suspicion.

00:00:51.453 --> 00:00:53.453
Would cloning become widespread?

00:00:53.813 --> 00:00:57.173
How long would it be until we started cloning humans?

00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:01.953
Had we gone too far and started to develop God-like powers?

00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:07.133
It seemed like humanity was on the very cusp of entering a new

00:01:07.193 --> 00:01:11.043
era that would change life, and its creation, as we knew it.

00:01:11.983 --> 00:01:18.273
But, behind the media hype on cloning humans, Dolly’s creation had enormous

00:01:18.303 --> 00:01:24.103
implications for science and our understanding of cell programming and genetic diseases.

00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:30.563
So, that’s what we are going to talk about today, the story of how a Scottish research team and a

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:37.263
cloned sheep took the world by surprise, how it actually worked, and what has happened since then.

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:43.283
OK then, let’s get started, and talk about Dolly the Sheep.

00:01:44.543 --> 00:01:50.643
Dolly was created at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, an institute for animal research.

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:54.773
The team of researchers there was trying to find better

00:01:54.773 --> 00:01:57.923
ways of creating genetically modified farm animals.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:04.933
Dolly was just one of their many experiments, but she would undoubtedly be the most famous.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:11.433
Dolly was born in July of 1996, but her birth was not made

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.773
public, it wasn’t announced publicly, until seven months later.

00:02:17.023 --> 00:02:22.553
This delay gave the institute a chance to publish its scientific paper on the

00:02:22.563 --> 00:02:27.653
methods used to create Dolly at the same time as it announced Dolly to the world.

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:35.058
It was a huge development, and in the week after Dolly was announced the otherwise quiet

00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:41.448
phone lines at the Roslin Institute received 3,000 phone calls from all over the world.

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:46.098
Her face was all over the news, all around the world, and

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:50.788
in an instant she became the most famous sheep in history.

00:02:51.698 --> 00:02:55.068
So, why was Dolly the Sheep such a big deal?

00:02:55.868 --> 00:03:00.858
Well, she was special, but contrary to what many people think she wasn’t

00:03:00.898 --> 00:03:05.448
actually the first cloned animal, or even the first cloned mammal.

00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:10.388
Cloning, the creation of an identical genetic copy of

00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:14.358
an organism, has a surprisingly long scientific history.

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:20.442
The first creature to be demonstrably cloned, to be cloned in a way that

00:03:20.442 --> 00:03:27.152
can be proved, was a sea urchin more than 100 years before Dolly, in 1885.

00:03:27.872 --> 00:03:33.502
Sea urchins, by the way, are those small, spikey sea animals you find on a sea bed.

00:03:33.832 --> 00:03:38.422
They are fairly basic creatures so it’s easy to study their development.

00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:45.442
Researchers found that by simply shaking sea urchins at a very early stage

00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:50.042
of their development, their cells would separate to form an additional

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:55.182
identical sea urchin - a process known as artificial embryo twinning.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:04:00.122
It just so happened that sea urchins were very easy to clone.

00:04:00.672 --> 00:04:03.592
Larger animals would prove to be more complicated.

00:04:04.642 --> 00:04:11.352
In 1975, cloning experiments were made using rabbit embryos, an embryo being

00:04:11.362 --> 00:04:16.352
the very first form of an animal or human at its earliest stages of growth.

00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:23.242
After transferring a rabbit embryo cell into an egg, a process known as nuclear

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:27.802
transfer, an advanced rabbit embryo was grown in a laboratory in Oxford.

00:04:29.052 --> 00:04:34.152
The embryo was not grown to its full potential, no rabbit was actually

00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:39.592
born, as this would have required placing the embryo inside a female rabbit.

00:04:40.472 --> 00:04:45.162
This, however, was the first time a mammal embryo had been created

00:04:45.332 --> 00:04:49.922
via nuclear transfer, but it was still restricted to the laboratory.

00:04:50.662 --> 00:04:54.822
Scientists needed to figure out a way of getting the embryo into

00:04:54.822 --> 00:04:59.492
a host mother, so that it could grow to full term, and be born.

00:05:00.692 --> 00:05:05.282
The first records of this were in the 1980s, when sheep and

00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:08.422
cattle were cloned using the nuclear transfer technique.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:13.352
The embryos created in laboratories were implanted, or placed

00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:17.952
inside, host animal mothers which resulted in live births.

00:05:18.972 --> 00:05:24.732
It's pretty amazing technologically, but it was actually quite simple compared to Dolly.

00:05:25.722 --> 00:05:31.912
So, let’s move on to Dolly the Sheep, the hero, or should I say heroine, of our story.

00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:36.642
Just how was she created, and why was this so important?

00:05:37.802 --> 00:05:43.292
Dolly was created with the help of three individual female sheep, or ewes.

00:05:44.192 --> 00:05:46.882
Sheep one, sheep two, and sheep three.

00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:51.932
It’s particularly important that all three of them were female,

00:05:52.202 --> 00:05:56.092
there were no male sheep involved in the creation of Dolly.

00:05:57.732 --> 00:06:03.512
Cells were taken from sheep one’s breast tissue, which would provide the DNA.

00:06:04.262 --> 00:06:09.112
Incidentally, it was because Dolly the Sheep’s DNA came from breast tissue

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:14.282
that she was named Dolly, after Dolly Parton the American country singer.

00:06:15.212 --> 00:06:19.452
If this explanation doesn’t make sense to you, then if you search

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:23.652
for images of “Dolly Parton” then perhaps it’ll be more clear.

00:06:24.772 --> 00:06:29.682
So, sheep one provided the DNA which Dolly was to be cloned from.

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:33.362
Importantly, this came from this sheep’s breast tissue.

00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:39.132
As you will know, DNA contains all of the genetic instructions

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:42.862
needed to grow, maintain and reproduce an organism.

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:47.372
In other words, it’s almost like a biological recipe book.

00:06:48.272 --> 00:06:54.022
This is important as it’ll be sheep one that will provide the DNA for Dolly;

00:06:54.342 --> 00:06:59.092
sheep one and Dolly will be genetically identical, they will be the same.

00:07:00.312 --> 00:07:04.132
It's also important to note that the cells used were from an

00:07:04.192 --> 00:07:08.292
adult sheep and they were what’s called specialised cells.

00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:13.822
Specialised cells are different from the cells that are used to create life.

00:07:14.432 --> 00:07:18.282
Specialised cells have been developed to fulfil a specialised

00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:22.352
role, for example in the case of Dolly, breast tissue cells.

00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:28.512
At the very beginning of the creation of a person or animal, we start off as a

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:33.392
single cell that divides and divides and divides, eventually creating an embryo.

00:07:34.062 --> 00:07:39.922
This early collection of cells, called embryonic stem cells, are not specialised.

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:44.122
They will go on to create every type of cell that our body needs.

00:07:45.162 --> 00:07:50.232
Dolly started off as a single specialised adult cell in a test tube.

00:07:51.032 --> 00:07:54.012
The scientists at the Roslin Institute were trying

00:07:54.022 --> 00:07:57.692
to create a new being from an adult specialised cell.

00:07:58.462 --> 00:08:01.462
This was previously thought to be impossible.

00:08:02.702 --> 00:08:08.382
Once the breast tissue cell was successfully isolated, separated, from the other

00:08:08.382 --> 00:08:14.882
cells, the next step was to insert it into an egg cell provided by sheep number two.

00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:20.542
This egg was unfertilised, it couldn’t create a lamb, a baby sheep.

00:08:21.522 --> 00:08:27.892
Scientists removed the cell’s nucleus, its centre, that contained the genetic material.

00:08:28.702 --> 00:08:33.622
They then replaced the nucleus with the adult breast cell from sheep one.

00:08:34.662 --> 00:08:38.742
This, perhaps, might sound simple, but it is, of course, a

00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:42.862
very complex process and various other steps are required.

00:08:43.884 --> 00:08:48.604
In fact, it took 227 attempts to produce Dolly.

00:08:49.854 --> 00:08:56.834
Of all these breast cells implanted into egg cells, only 13 successfully formed into embryos.

00:08:57.854 --> 00:09:04.184
These 13 developing embryos were inserted into surrogate ewes, mother sheep.

00:09:04.844 --> 00:09:08.894
Only one became pregnant, sheep three, who gave birth to Dolly.

00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:16.954
The scientists could immediately see that Dolly was indeed a clone of sheep one because sheep

00:09:16.964 --> 00:09:23.424
one was a breed of sheep with a white face, whereas sheep two and three had a black face.

00:09:24.074 --> 00:09:28.474
When Dolly was born she had a white face, indicating she was completely

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:34.414
unrelated to sheep two or three, and was an exact replica of sheep number one.

00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:39.664
So, now that we've got an idea of what was involved in Dolly’s

00:09:39.714 --> 00:09:44.024
creation, we can move on to focus on the importance of this development.

00:09:44.954 --> 00:09:48.704
What made Dolly’s creation such a scientific breakthrough?

00:09:49.024 --> 00:09:54.064
What developments have been made as a result of the science behind cloning Dolly the sheep?

00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:57.484
In other words, why was Dolly so important?

00:09:58.934 --> 00:10:03.284
As we discussed earlier, cloning mammals was certainly not new.

00:10:04.254 --> 00:10:10.314
What made Dolly’s case so special was that an exact genetic replica of sheep one,

00:10:10.704 --> 00:10:16.611
a mammal, had been  engineered and brought to life from an adult specialised cell.

00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:22.711
The fact that a sheep, a mammal, had been cloned from a single adult cell seemed

00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:28.171
to open up a huge realm of cloning possibilities in the not so distant future.

00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:34.671
If sheep, then theoretically any mammal, including humans, could be cloned.

00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:37.011
The unthinkable had been done.

00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:40.571
Pandora’s box had been opened and it seemed like the

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:43.871
world had changed forever and there was no going back.

00:10:44.681 --> 00:10:48.691
Pope John Paul II criticised Dolly’s creation as being a

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:53.511
“dangerous experiment” and called for a ban on cloning humans.

00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:58.981
The World Health Organisation released a statement denouncing human cloning as

00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:04.541
being "ethically unacceptable and contrary to human integrity and morality".

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:10.261
Scientists were accused of playing God and there was a huge amount

00:11:10.271 --> 00:11:14.621
of controversy, of disagreement, about the future of cloning.

00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:22.661
Yet despite the intense media frenzy, or excitement, about the seemingly very near prospect

00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:28.811
of human cloning, the advances made by Dolly’s research team have not led to a world

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:34.191
filled with cloned humans, let alone the great increase in cloning that was predicted.

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:36.531
Why not, you might ask.

00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:41.361
Well, although scientists believe it could theoretically be possible,

00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:45.701
it would be inadvisable, and there simply isn’t the will to try it.

00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:49.471
It doesn’t mean that there haven’t been some developments though.

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:58.191
Indeed, a human embryonic clone was successfully created in 2013 using DNA from skin cells, and

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:05.811
two monkeys were successfully cloned in China in 2018, using the same technique as for Dolly.

00:12:06.421 --> 00:12:09.321
This suggests that the same technique that created

00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:12.811
Dolly the Sheep could potentially be used in humans.

00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:21.711
But human cloning was and still is considered to be too dangerous and completely unethical.

00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:28.621
Approximately 46 countries have banned human cloning, although some of these countries still

00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:35.001
allow human embryo cloning for research purposes despite bans on human reproductive cloning.

00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:41.151
There seems to be a general consensus, an agreement, that attempting to

00:12:41.151 --> 00:12:46.741
create a human clone, also known as reproductive cloning, is unacceptable.

00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:53.421
However, in the USA, despite powerful anti-cloning religious influences,

00:12:53.664 --> 00:12:58.651
there are actually no laws regulating human cloning at a federal level.

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:02.221
In the UK, reproductive cloning is banned.

00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:08.521
Therapeutic cloning, cloning human embryos to research the development of genetic diseases,

00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:14.361
and embryonic cloning for stem cell research, are both allowed but highly regulated.

00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:19.061
At the UN and in the European Union, there is no clear

00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:23.411
consensus on creating fully binding laws that ban cloning.

00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:28.001
Some European countries allow cloning for therapeutic

00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:31.311
and stem cell research, as do many countries in Asia.

00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:37.611
It seems that the awkward questions about the creation of life that Dolly the Sheep has

00:13:37.611 --> 00:13:44.331
generated are still very far from being adequately resolved - both legally and ethically.

00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:52.431
This being said, Dolly’s creation and the process used have been invaluable to science.

00:13:53.331 --> 00:13:58.011
Indeed, the original purpose of creating Dolly was to help scientists

00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:02.991
to better understand and cure diseases in humans, not to clone them.

00:14:04.521 --> 00:14:10.421
The main benefit of Dolly’s creation has been the advances made in the field of cell research.

00:14:11.211 --> 00:14:18.341
Prior to, before, the creation of Dolly, scientists believed that once cells had become specialised

00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:24.851
they completely lost their ability to be able to be reprogrammed to produce other types of cells.

00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:30.840
What Dolly had proved was that cellular nuclear reprogramming is indeed

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.790
possible - in other words that we can turn back time in terms of the

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:41.340
development of specialised cells to reproduce stem cells from specialised ones.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.310
You’ve probably heard the term “stem cell” before, but here’s a quick

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.750
explanation, which will help you understand why Dolly was so important.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:57.780
Stem cells are the very special type of cell that have the potential,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.790
the ability, to develop into many different types of cells.

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:07.660
Stem cells can replicate, they can divide into exact copies

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.850
of themselves, forming more cells, known as daughter cells.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.350
You can think of stem cells as being the very building blocks of life itself.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:23.790
They provide the raw materials required to produce all other types of cells in the body.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:31.213
Previously, research into stem cells required embryonic stem cells, cells from

00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:37.063
a human embryo, which understandably raises a huge amount of ethical concerns.

00:15:37.983 --> 00:15:43.173
When scientists clone human embryonic stem cells for use in the lab, there’s an

00:15:43.183 --> 00:15:48.233
argument that they are creating a human being, giving themselves God-like powers.

00:15:49.423 --> 00:15:54.763
Even if the embryos they are using are really only the starting point of life, a

00:15:54.923 --> 00:16:00.923
microscopically small bunch of cells, they could theoretically become humans like you and me.

00:16:01.783 --> 00:16:04.933
Understandably, not many people are comfortable with

00:16:04.933 --> 00:16:08.533
the idea of humans being created for research purposes.

00:16:09.423 --> 00:16:12.533
So here’s where the importance of Dolly comes in.

00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:18.933
The creation of Dolly showed that we can create artificial stem cells from

00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:25.223
adult cells using blood or skin tissue, without having to clone human embryos.

00:16:26.173 --> 00:16:33.003
This means that scientists can run experiments on these artificially created stem cells, helping

00:16:33.003 --> 00:16:39.573
us better understand diseases, without the same ethical dilemma of cloning human embryos.

00:16:41.093 --> 00:16:44.953
Indeed, this technology was used to create the genetically

00:16:45.023 --> 00:16:49.633
modified heart in the first pig-to-human heart transplant.

00:16:50.883 --> 00:16:56.313
As you can create these artificial stem cells using a patient's own cells, it is

00:16:56.313 --> 00:17:01.403
becoming increasingly possible to create more personalised treatments for diseases,

00:17:01.693 --> 00:17:07.403
as well as reducing the chances of rejection when growing organs for transplantation.

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:11.203
Obviously, this is good news for medical science.

00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:16.823
But Dolly’s legacy expands further than just the medical world.

00:17:17.383 --> 00:17:20.973
Cloning animals has continued to develop as an industry.

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:26.143
Particularly desirable farm animals are starting to be cloned, so

00:17:26.143 --> 00:17:30.493
that animals with valuable characteristics can continue to breed.

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:35.783
This mainly takes place in China and the USA - the cloning

00:17:35.783 --> 00:17:39.103
of animals used for food has been banned in Europe.

00:17:40.243 --> 00:17:44.063
Some types of animals that are bordering on extinction have also

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:48.214
been cloned to try to prevent them from dying out as a species.

00:17:48.954 --> 00:17:53.754
You may have heard tales about bringing back mammoths, or even dinosaurs,

00:17:53.944 --> 00:17:57.874
from the dead using cloning, just like they did to create Dolly.

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:02.044
This is now more of a possibility than ever before,

00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:05.404
provided we have DNA that has been well preserved.

00:18:06.524 --> 00:18:11.554
While not quite as impressive as a T-Rex, scientists in America have

00:18:11.594 --> 00:18:16.344
already successfully cloned an endangered type of American ferret, a

00:18:16.484 --> 00:18:21.864
small furry mammal, using cells from a deceased, a dead, individual.

00:18:22.574 --> 00:18:27.731
In addition, there are also various companies around the world that specialise in the

00:18:27.731 --> 00:18:35.164
cloning of pets for wealthy owners, people whose favourite dog or cat has died and they

00:18:35.164 --> 00:18:40.894
are prepared to pay tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for a carbon copy of it.

00:18:42.104 --> 00:18:45.794
So, now we’ve discussed the importance of Dolly’s creation

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:49.824
and its implications, what about the actual sheep herself?

00:18:50.164 --> 00:18:53.294
We’ve really skipped over our main character, haven’t we?

00:18:54.494 --> 00:18:58.494
Well, the reality is that, although Dolly’s existence

00:18:58.514 --> 00:19:03.404
was remarkable, her life itself was pretty unremarkable.

00:19:04.004 --> 00:19:07.074
She was a sheep, she got up in the morning, she ate

00:19:07.074 --> 00:19:10.634
grass, and did what every other sheep in the world does.

00:19:11.364 --> 00:19:17.064
Dolly lived with a flock of other sheep, some cloned, some non-cloned, and went

00:19:17.074 --> 00:19:23.824
on to have six lambs, all fathered naturally by the same ram, the male sheep.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:28.944
Unfortunately, Dolly developed arthritis - the disease that

00:19:28.964 --> 00:19:33.014
causes the joints to become swollen, causing pain and stiffness.

00:19:33.724 --> 00:19:38.834
Older sheep often suffer with arthritis, it’s not uncommon at all, however,

00:19:39.064 --> 00:19:44.194
Dolly was only middle-aged when she first started showing signs of stiffness.

00:19:45.024 --> 00:19:50.064
In 2003, her handlers noticed that she was coughing frequently.

00:19:50.574 --> 00:19:53.954
A scan revealed that she had a severe disease that

00:19:53.954 --> 00:19:57.774
causes lung cancer in sheep, again not uncommon at all.

00:19:58.454 --> 00:20:03.324
But she was old and unwell, and it was decided to put her to sleep,

00:20:03.564 --> 00:20:07.744
to euthanise her, while she was still unconscious during the scan.

00:20:09.234 --> 00:20:14.384
There were some fears that Dolly’s ill health, or sickness, could be linked to

00:20:14.384 --> 00:20:19.614
her being a clone, and that her arthritis could be linked to premature ageing.

00:20:20.484 --> 00:20:24.624
However, out of the other Dolly clones that were later made from the

00:20:24.624 --> 00:20:29.824
same cell culture, only one sheep appeared to develop moderate arthritis.

00:20:30.264 --> 00:20:32.867
So, it may well  have just been bad luck.

00:20:34.017 --> 00:20:38.287
To conclude, Dolly the Sheep has inspired some of the most important

00:20:38.327 --> 00:20:42.177
recent developments in genetic modification and biotechnology.

00:20:43.057 --> 00:20:49.627
While the hype, the excitement, surrounding her creation and the fears that it produced have

00:20:49.827 --> 00:20:55.837
faded, the improvements in science that she directly inspired have been truly groundbreaking.

00:20:56.657 --> 00:21:02.467
Dolly the Sheep was living proof that adult cells could be reprogrammed to make stem cells.

00:21:03.617 --> 00:21:08.077
Thanks to the work of the team at the Roslin Institute, we are a step closer to

00:21:08.097 --> 00:21:13.517
understanding and ultimately curing some of the most serious and debilitating diseases.

00:21:14.177 --> 00:21:20.707
And, contrary to what the fear mongers might have said back in 1997, the world is not filled

00:21:20.857 --> 00:21:27.167
with human clones, dinosaurs are not roaming the streets of London and New York, and in fact

00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:33.957
all that happened was that a very unordinary sheep ended up living a very ordinary life.

00:21:35.947 --> 00:21:40.727
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Dolly the Sheep.

00:21:41.107 --> 00:21:45.427
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and that you’ve learned a little bit about the science

00:21:45.447 --> 00:21:51.127
behind cloning as well as some of the important advances that Dolly’s creation has inspired.

00:21:51.717 --> 00:21:54.897
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:57.017
What are your thoughts on human cloning?

00:21:57.467 --> 00:21:59.837
Are there any circumstances in which you think it

00:21:59.867 --> 00:22:03.187
should be allowed, or should it be completely banned?

00:22:03.937 --> 00:22:08.197
What about animal cloning for agricultural or medical purposes?

00:22:08.523 --> 00:22:12.647
How do you think stem cell therapy could change our lives in the future?

00:22:13.067 --> 00:22:16.517
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

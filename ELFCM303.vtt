Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:16.951
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:21.471
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:25.191
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:29.351
about a man who was one of the most feared men in Africa.

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:31.691
His name was Robert Mugabe.

00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:36.991
He was the Zimbabwean schoolteacher from humble beginnings who went onto

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:42.401
become an anti-colonial leader and then, with time, a notorious tyrant.

00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:48.931
His rule was one of political assassinations and disappearances, corruption, and rigged

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:55.521
elections, yet Mugabe was central to Zimbabwe’s independence and establishment as a country.

00:00:55.941 --> 00:01:01.761
He was loved by some, hated by many, feared by all, and begrudgingly

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:06.631
respected by most for his leading role in the decolonisation process.

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:11.371
So, let’s get right into it and talk about Robert Mugabe.

00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:19.311
Robert Gabriel Mugabe was born on February 21st, 1924, in Katuma, on

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:24.361
a Jesuit mission in Southern Rhodesia, the area we now call Zimbabwe.

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:29.431
Mugabe was born just one year after white settlers

00:01:29.651 --> 00:01:34.381
established Southern Rhodesia as a British colony in 1923.

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:40.061
Northern Rhodesia, by the way, was the place we now know as Zambia.

00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:45.811
Both were run by the British South Africa Company on behalf of the British

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:51.351
Government and were, as a result, self-governing British protectorates.

00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:56.481
Like many other countries across Africa at the time, both countries

00:01:56.591 --> 00:02:01.661
were run not only by colonial governments but by white-minorities.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:07.171
Historians estimate that in Southern Rhodesia, around a quarter of a

00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:12.691
million whites ruled over a population of six million black Africans.

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:16.971
This was the historical context Mugabe was born into.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:24.141
His father, Gabriel, was a carpenter, and his mother, Bona, a religious teacher.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:27.401
The pair would go on to have six children.

00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:34.471
And growing up on a Jesuit mission meant that religion surrounded the young Mugabes.

00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:42.701
The priests who ran the schools were feared disciplinarians, tough teachers, yet young

00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:48.611
Robert performed well at school, he was known for being quiet and studious, a good student.

00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:55.771
But in 1930, when Mugabe’s father had a disagreement with one of the Jesuits,

00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:02.258
the family was shunned, pushed out, by its leader, Father Jean-Baptiste Loubière.

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:08.591
The family moved to another village briefly, but the Mugabe children were allowed to

00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:14.041
remain at the mission school, living with relatives in a nearby town during the week.

00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:20.731
Around the same time, Mugabe's older brother, Raphael, died, and then a few

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:25.201
years later another older brother, Michael, died of suspected poisoning.

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:31.401
As you might imagine, his brother’s deaths had a great impact on the young boy.

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:37.251
And to make matters worse, shortly afterwards, when Mugabe was just 10 years

00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:43.461
old, his father, abandoned the family and left for the city of Bulawayo,

00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:47.311
where he would go on to have three more children with another woman.

00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:53.601
Mugabe found himself, aged only ten years old, with two of his older

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:59.071
brothers dead, abandoned by his father, and the oldest son in the house

00:03:59.151 --> 00:04:03.851
without any real male role models, no other older men to look up to.

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:11.351
Then something happened that changed Mugabe’s life forever, an unlikely event, perhaps, for

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:16.731
a man who would later become best known for forcing the white population out of his country.

00:04:17.881 --> 00:04:21.771
Father Loubière, the leader of the Jesuit group, died

00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:26.241
and was replaced by an Irishman, Father Jerome O'Hea.

00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:32.971
Not only did he accept the Mugabes back in the community, and, unlike

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:37.751
the racism underpinning Rhodesian society at the time, he preached racial

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:43.711
equality, but O'Hea took the young Mugabe, took young Robert ‘under his wing.’

00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:47.581
To take someone ‘under your wing’, by the way, simply

00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:50.251
means to take care of them and look out for them.

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:57.291
As well as giving him a good Jesuit education, O'Hea taught Mugabe about the Irish War of

00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:03.998
Independence and described how Irish revolutionaries had overthrown British colonial rule.

00:05:05.218 --> 00:05:11.148
Like O’Hea’s homeland, Ireland, Mugabe’s Zimbabwe, or Southern Rhodesia, as it

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:16.348
was then, was under British control, so despite the pair being of very different

00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:22.318
ages, and of races that would not traditionally mix in Southern Rhodesia, the

00:05:22.318 --> 00:05:27.061
pair found common ground in their countries mutual oppression by the British.

00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:35.331
As a teenager, Mugabe was a quiet boy who preferred reading to making friends, and he spent more and

00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:42.131
more time with Father O’Hea, who had picked Mugabe out as an intelligent boy with a bright future.

00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:49.021
O’Hea’s kind nature made such an impression on Mugabe that he said of him many years

00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:55.381
later: “He was a nice Irishman… Only an Irishman could do that; an Englishman couldn't."

00:05:56.511 --> 00:06:03.921
But Mugabe wouldn’t stay under Father O’Hea’s wing forever, and in 1941, aged 17,

00:06:04.051 --> 00:06:09.731
he began a teacher training course, and he graduated four years later in 1945.

00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:16.121
Perhaps influenced by Father O’Hea, the next stage of his life was

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:20.061
spent teaching at mission schools in Southern and Northern Rhodesia.

00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:25.561
But he continued to be devoted to his studies, he graduated with a

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:29.771
degree in History and English from the University of Fort Hare, a South

00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:33.691
African university known as a breeding ground for African-nationalism.

00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:39.251
And by 1954, he had completed a Bachelor of Education degree through

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:45.411
distance courses, and in 1955 Mugabe moved to Northern Rhodesia, modern

00:06:45.616 --> 00:06:50.586
Zambia, where he started another distance degree, this time in economics.

00:06:51.586 --> 00:06:56.816
Clearly, he had a thirst for knowledge, but he wanted something more.

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:01.076
To find that something, he would need to make the

00:07:01.076 --> 00:07:05.706
7,000km trip to Ghana, on the west coast of Africa.

00:07:06.656 --> 00:07:10.819
It would be in Ghana that he’d meet his first wife, Sarah Heyfron.

00:07:11.176 --> 00:07:14.316
But Mugabe didn’t come looking for love.

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:19.116
He came to see what a newly liberated African state could look like.

00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:26.406
In 1957 Ghana had broken free from Britain and became the first sub-Saharan

00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:31.766
African country to become fully independent from the European colonial powers.

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:39.836
Now free, it moved in an African-nationalist direction underpinned by socialist ideas.

00:07:40.806 --> 00:07:44.576
Mugabe was excited by the political freedoms there, and

00:07:44.576 --> 00:07:48.586
he thrived in the decolonising world of Ghanain society.

00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:54.706
It was in Ghana that Mugabe first began reading Marxist teachings, and

00:07:54.796 --> 00:07:59.646
he supported the Ghanaian efforts to make education available to all, and

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:04.576
to soften the social class divisions that had existed under British rule.

00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:14.496
But when he returned to Southern Rhodesia in 1960, when he came home, Mugabe found a changing place.

00:08:15.126 --> 00:08:17.746
The colonial government had increased the white

00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:21.376
population and displaced thousands of black families.

00:08:21.786 --> 00:08:26.656
The black majority were still hugely under-represented in politics.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:34.382
Any opposition was met with police brutality; African nationalist political groups were shut down.

00:08:35.442 --> 00:08:41.542
While Mugabe had been away in Ghana, an anti-colonial political movement had sprung

00:08:41.582 --> 00:08:47.202
up in Southern Rhodesia but it had been quickly outlawed by the colonial government.

00:08:48.392 --> 00:08:56.182
Building on this, in January of 1960 something called the National Democratic Party [the NDP] was

00:08:56.182 --> 00:09:02.582
established, which had the objective of improving black rights and representation in the country.

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:05.662
It met the same fate.

00:09:06.182 --> 00:09:08.832
Several NDP leaders were arrested.

00:09:09.262 --> 00:09:14.552
There were protests outside the Prime Minister's office, and Mugabe joined in with them.

00:09:15.722 --> 00:09:21.942
As he was respected for his life experience - his time abroad and his extensive university

00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:28.285
education, as well as his natural charisma, Mugabe was asked to speak to the crowd.

00:09:29.444 --> 00:09:35.362
Unintimidated by the police presence, he explained how their Ghanain neighbours

00:09:35.542 --> 00:09:41.122
had become independent and were working to make their country a more equal place.

00:09:42.092 --> 00:09:48.662
And perhaps sensing the anti-colonial energy in the country, and getting a taste for what might

00:09:48.662 --> 00:09:56.161
be possible, Mugabe decided to give up his teaching career and devote himself entirely to politics

00:09:56.371 --> 00:10:02.857
and activism - a decision that would change the course of his life, and Zimbabwean history forever.

00:10:04.057 --> 00:10:10.136
Now, Mugabe's rise to power was long, complicated, and included a vast array of

00:10:10.246 --> 00:10:15.156
alliances and deals with people across the political spectrum from a number of

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:20.266
different parties that were constantly being banned, splitting up, and reforming.

00:10:20.776 --> 00:10:25.456
But let me give you a little taste, some of the most important elements of it.

00:10:26.716 --> 00:10:33.616
The NDP, which, remember, was the National Democratic Party, became ZAPU, the

00:10:33.826 --> 00:10:40.726
Zimbabwe African Peoples Union, but ZAPU itself then split in August of 1963.

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:47.336
The more radical members of ZAPU, including Mugabe, formed the Zimbabwe

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:53.196
African National Union - known as ZANU, so you had these two groups wanting

00:10:53.236 --> 00:10:57.456
similar outcomes but with differing views about how to achieve them.

00:10:58.446 --> 00:11:02.806
Both groups were a clear threat to the white minority government.

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:08.356
In charge of Southern Rhodesia at this time was a man named Ian Smith,

00:11:08.646 --> 00:11:13.506
who led a party called the Rhodesian Front, which had won power in 1962.

00:11:14.566 --> 00:11:21.512
The Rhodesian Front wanted independence from Britain but it wanted to keep white -majority rule.

00:11:22.668 --> 00:11:28.368
Britain was prepared to give Southern Rhodesia its independence, but a key

00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:33.478
requirement for this was that it would transition to black-majority majority rule.

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:41.528
After Smith took over in 1964, in a bid to suppress political opposition, ZANU

00:11:41.588 --> 00:11:47.398
was banned and Mugabe, as a key member of the party, was thrown into prison.

00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:54.248
Then in 1965, frustrated by Britain’s refusal to allow Southern Rhodesia

00:11:54.518 --> 00:11:59.958
to become independent and maintain white minority rule, Ian Smith declared

00:11:59.988 --> 00:12:05.128
independence from Britain and renamed Southern Rhodesia as Rhodesia.

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:11.638
The British government did not recognise the move, and this threw the country,

00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:17.428
which was, let’s remember, not technically its own country, into political turmoil.

00:12:17.958 --> 00:12:23.578
This caused what had been, until then, a series of small civil disobediences

00:12:23.588 --> 00:12:28.718
and skirmishes, small battles, to turn into a full-blown civil war.

00:12:30.148 --> 00:12:36.028
This war, the Rhodesian Bush War or the ‘Second Chimurenga’, was a drawn-out

00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:41.138
civil war that included many different fighting factions, and lots of death.

00:12:41.738 --> 00:12:50.168
It lasted for 15 years, from July 1964 to December 1979, and involved brutal,

00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:56.027
often hand to hand combat and killed tens of thousands of Zimbabweans.

00:12:56.749 --> 00:13:02.788
Mugabe was one of the main anti-Smith, anti-colonial, leaders, and he continued

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:08.638
to coordinate the war effort from jail before being released in November of 1974.

00:13:09.818 --> 00:13:15.848
By mid-1976 he had firmly established himself as the most powerful

00:13:15.868 --> 00:13:19.578
guerrilla leader battling the white-dominated Rhodesian government.

00:13:20.308 --> 00:13:25.088
And by 1979, his guerilla forces had gained the upper

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.488
hand and surrounded several key Rhodesian cities.

00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:33.588
Smith and his government were forced to the negotiating table.

00:13:34.628 --> 00:13:41.088
By now Mugabe was publically calling for Smith’s execution, and called for violence

00:13:41.118 --> 00:13:47.408
against white Rhodesians, who he called "blood-sucking exploiters" and "hard-core racists."

00:13:48.108 --> 00:13:54.698
By 1979, the writing was on the wall for Smith and white-minority led Southern Rhodesia.

00:13:55.288 --> 00:14:01.598
To see the writing on the wall, by the way, means to be aware of or foresee something bad happening.

00:14:02.648 --> 00:14:09.348
In April of 1979 there was a general election, and Abel Muzorewa, a moderate

00:14:09.418 --> 00:14:14.258
black bishop, was elected Prime Minister of the newly named Zimbabwe-Rhodesia.

00:14:15.058 --> 00:14:19.318
This election, however, was boycotted by both ZANU and

00:14:19.318 --> 00:14:23.138
ZAPU, the two main opposition parties didn’t take part.

00:14:24.178 --> 00:14:30.108
What’s more, the British government, led by Margaret Thatcher, said it would only recognise

00:14:30.158 --> 00:14:36.278
the new state of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia if ZANU and ZAPU participated in the elections.

00:14:36.908 --> 00:14:43.168
Now, I know there are a lot of names and acronyms here, but if we skip to the end,

00:14:43.378 --> 00:14:48.388
this culminated in something called the Lancaster House Agreement, and led to a

00:14:48.398 --> 00:14:53.378
general election in which all of the parties involved in the civil war took part.

00:14:53.878 --> 00:14:59.148
Mugabe stood as leader of ZANU, he survived two assassination attempts,

00:14:59.368 --> 00:15:04.928
and on the 18th of April 1980, after winning 63 percent of the vote,

00:15:05.268 --> 00:15:10.338
ZANU won the election, Southern Rhodesia finally gained its independence.

00:15:11.398 --> 00:15:16.408
Shortly after midnight, at the age of 56, Robert Mugabe became

00:15:16.408 --> 00:15:20.488
the first Prime Minister of a newly independent Zimbabwe.

00:15:21.548 --> 00:15:28.108
In his victory speech, he said, “The wrongs of the past must now stand forgiven and

00:15:28.108 --> 00:15:33.898
forgotten…It could never be a correct justification that because whites oppressed us

00:15:33.898 --> 00:15:39.258
yesterday when they had power, the blacks must oppress them today because they have power.”

00:15:40.378 --> 00:15:44.338
“Democracy,” he said, “is never mob rule.”

00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:51.098
As you may know, especially towards the end of his political and earthly life,

00:15:51.338 --> 00:15:56.116
Mugabe’s actions were somewhat different from what he preached back in 1980.

00:15:57.338 --> 00:16:01.978
So, what was life like under Mugabe in newly liberated Zimbabwe?

00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:06.798
Initially, he kept his word, and invited the former leader

00:16:06.798 --> 00:16:09.968
of the Rhodesian military to stay on in his position.

00:16:10.508 --> 00:16:15.628
He respected the white parliamentary seats as outlined in the Lancaster House Agreement.

00:16:16.398 --> 00:16:21.261
And he formed a coalition with ZAPU, which drew its support from the

00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:26.231
minority Ndebele people, as opposed to Mugabe's Shona ethnic group.

00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:32.171
Like he had seen in Ghana, Mugabe tried to make Zimbabwean society more equal.

00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:36.851
He oversaw massive increases in education and health spending.

00:16:37.491 --> 00:16:42.091
When Mugabe took over, Zimbabwe had just 177 secondary

00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:45.441
schools for a population of over 7 million people.

00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:50.231
By 2000 that number was 1,548.

00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:57.221
During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62 percent to 82 percent.

00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:02.241
Child immunisation grew from 25 percent to 92 percent.

00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:05.361
Commendable, laudable achievements, of course.

00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:11.521
So what changed, why isn’t Robert Mugabe hailed as a visionary leader?

00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:18.651
Well, as the historian Lord Acton once wrote, “absolute power corrupts absolutely”.

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:23.001
And this certainly applies to Robert Mugabe, as he

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:26.701
started the transition from freedom fighter to tyrant.

00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:31.355
This transition started pretty soon after he took power.

00:17:32.575 --> 00:17:38.935
In 1982, Mugabe forced the ZAPU leader, Joshua Nkomo, out of the coalition,

00:17:39.255 --> 00:17:44.095
and fighting between the Shona and the Ndebele ethnic groups broke out.

00:17:45.465 --> 00:17:49.285
In what became known as the Gukurahundi, the 5th Brigade

00:17:49.295 --> 00:17:53.885
of the Zimbabwean army murdered 20,000 Ndebele people.

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:57.989
Historians are almost certain the atrocity, this

00:17:58.239 --> 00:18:02.489
genocide, in effect, was done directly on Mugabe’s orders.

00:18:03.319 --> 00:18:07.189
It was becoming clear to Zimbabweans that their new leader was

00:18:07.189 --> 00:18:11.642
willing not only to kill white people, but black Zimbabweans.

00:18:12.159 --> 00:18:17.879
Then, a few years later in 1987, ZANU and ZAPU merged to

00:18:17.879 --> 00:18:22.849
form ZANU-PF, and Mugabe changed the Zimbabwean constitution.

00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:28.239
On the 30th of December, Mugabe was made ‘executive president’,

00:18:28.579 --> 00:18:33.039
meaning he took on all the responsibilities of a head of state, head

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:37.439
of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces in one role.

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:42.489
In a single move, he had taken out his main political rivals

00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:46.499
and consolidated the power of the entire Zimbabwean state.

00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:51.769
It granted him the powers to declare martial law, bypass government,

00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:56.419
and extend his time in office for an unspecified number of years.

00:18:57.629 --> 00:19:01.449
Zimbabwe had, effectively, become a one-party state.

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:04.739
And Mugabe was the man at the top.

00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:11.659
It would be a position he held for 29 years and 325 days.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:14.789
So, how did things progress?

00:19:15.249 --> 00:19:19.519
Well, Zimbabwe was still, in theory at least, a democracy.

00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:26.139
There were more elections, and, surprise, surprise, Mugabe would be elected again and again.

00:19:26.699 --> 00:19:33.498
In 1990 he was reelected in an election marked by voter intimidation and violence.

00:19:34.278 --> 00:19:37.678
He was starting to grow unpopular domestically, not just

00:19:37.678 --> 00:19:41.738
for his political choices but also for his romantic ones.

00:19:42.318 --> 00:19:47.968
See, it was around this time that he began an affair with his secretary, Grace Marufu,

00:19:48.218 --> 00:19:53.918
who was 41 years his junior, she was in her mid 20s while he was in his mid 60s.

00:19:54.838 --> 00:19:59.378
He would marry her in an extravagant ceremony in 1996, and

00:19:59.568 --> 00:20:02.898
she quickly became the least popular woman in the country.

00:20:03.908 --> 00:20:09.938
Firstly, she was a foreigner - she was born in South Africa - but she was also known for her

00:20:09.938 --> 00:20:15.718
luxurious lifestyle at a time when Zimbabwean people were struggling to put food on the table.

00:20:16.658 --> 00:20:22.205
While regular Zimbabweans struggled to get by on a few dollars a day, there were reports

00:20:22.245 --> 00:20:29.415
that the President’s wife had spent $75,000 on luxury goods in a single Paris shop.

00:20:30.255 --> 00:20:33.605
But the excess wasn’t limited to his young wife.

00:20:34.205 --> 00:20:38.605
In November 1998, there were riots when Mugabe gave

00:20:38.605 --> 00:20:41.715
himself and members of his government big pay rises.

00:20:42.855 --> 00:20:49.445
Despite his questionable electoral wins, the ethnic tensions, mass murder, and civil unrest

00:20:49.445 --> 00:20:56.105
in Zimbabwe, by the early 1990’s Mugabe’s international reputation was growing, and he

00:20:56.105 --> 00:21:01.575
was viewed as the most successful of all African liberation leaders-turned politicians.

00:21:02.765 --> 00:21:07.345
By the time the 2000’s came around, however, that reputation

00:21:07.535 --> 00:21:10.195
was beginning to wane, it was beginning to suffer.

00:21:11.215 --> 00:21:16.305
One of his main policies was land reform, where he had ordered the seizure of

00:21:16.305 --> 00:21:21.200
farmland from white farmers and gave it to inexperienced black Zimbabweans.

00:21:22.025 --> 00:21:26.825
Without the knowledge of how to farm the land effectively, and in combination

00:21:26.825 --> 00:21:31.515
with severe drought, the inexperienced farmers were unable to produce

00:21:31.535 --> 00:21:36.465
enough food to feed the country, which caused food shortages and famine.

00:21:37.835 --> 00:21:42.405
There were also major foreign policy missteps, mistakes, including

00:21:42.555 --> 00:21:45.845
getting involved in war in Democratic Republic of the Congo.

00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:51.375
All of this drained the country’s coffers, it was hugely expensive.

00:21:52.441 --> 00:21:56.641
By 2002, economic mismanagement left over half of

00:21:56.661 --> 00:21:59.881
the Zimbabwean population needing emergency food aid.

00:22:00.651 --> 00:22:02.431
Inflation skyrocketed.

00:22:03.201 --> 00:22:07.671
And people - both Zimbabweans and the international community - began

00:22:07.671 --> 00:22:11.031
to notice Mugabe’s increasing authoritarian behaviour.

00:22:12.211 --> 00:22:18.231
Although he was reelected again in 2002, Mugabe’s position was now tainted by

00:22:18.381 --> 00:22:23.601
voter intimidation and violence, and he was criticised by international observers.

00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:28.711
It was clear that he didn’t quite practise the democratic views he preached.

00:22:29.601 --> 00:22:34.201
And as the country’s economy began to unravel, as it began

00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:38.401
to collapse, Mugabe intensified his hold on Zimbabwe.

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:44.771
Having long been accustomed to using violent means for political ends, Mugabe’s

00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:50.471
ZANU-PF stepped up its campaign of abductions, murders and intimidation.

00:22:51.251 --> 00:22:55.611
And with Mugabe more concerned about silencing political opponents than

00:22:55.611 --> 00:23:00.901
governing, Zimbabweans suffered the crippling effects of an economy in freefall.

00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:10.161
By 2007, TIME magazine described Zimbabwe’s economy as suffering “1,700 percent inflation,

00:23:10.431 --> 00:23:18.161
an 80 percent unemployment rate, and average life expectancy of 35, the lowest in the world.”

00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:23.671
Yet in 2008, Mugabe ran for president again.

00:23:24.141 --> 00:23:31.231
But as the results were slowly released, it emerged that, this time, Mugabe might have lost.

00:23:32.031 --> 00:23:35.831
He demanded a recount, for the ballots to be counted again.

00:23:36.931 --> 00:23:42.341
Faced with intimidation and ZANU-PF approved violence in the streets, Mugabe’s

00:23:42.341 --> 00:23:47.333
opponent - the former finance minister, Morgan Tsvangirai - withdrew from

00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:52.063
the race, saying that free and fair elections were impossible in Zimbabwe.

00:23:52.993 --> 00:23:56.123
Mugabe was, unsurprisingly, declared the winner.

00:23:57.493 --> 00:24:03.663
After international voices - including previously supportive African countries - called for a power

00:24:03.663 --> 00:24:10.473
sharing arrangement with Tsvangirai’s MDC party, an agreement was made but quickly fell apart.

00:24:11.173 --> 00:24:15.973
Then MDC supporters and activists began to disappear,

00:24:16.313 --> 00:24:19.853
and international critics called for Mugabe to step down.

00:24:20.843 --> 00:24:21.283
Did he?

00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:22.473
Of course not.

00:24:23.024 --> 00:24:26.774
“ I will never, never, never surrender,” Mugabe said.

00:24:27.044 --> 00:24:29.134
“Zimbabwe is mine, I am a Zimbabwean.

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.834
Zimbabwe for Zimbabweans.”

00:24:32.114 --> 00:24:34.864
“Only God, who appointed me, will remove me.”

00:24:36.064 --> 00:24:40.614
He wouldn’t have to wait all that long…but first, there was time for another election.

00:24:41.224 --> 00:24:49.984
In May of 2013, Mugabe was again reelected in suspicious circumstances, at the ripe old age of 89.

00:24:50.854 --> 00:24:56.614
With his health deteriorating and rumours about who would succeed him, political infighting

00:24:56.624 --> 00:25:02.944
broke out within the ZANU-PF ranks as potential successors tried to position themselves.

00:25:03.334 --> 00:25:05.894
Yet, Mugabe still clung to power.

00:25:06.854 --> 00:25:14.384
Finally, on November the 15th of 2017, the military intervened and put Mugabe under house arrest.

00:25:15.064 --> 00:25:20.634
The political pressure eventually became too much and Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s only

00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:25.314
leader since its independence, finally stepped down on the 21st of November

00:25:25.504 --> 00:25:31.544
2017, exactly a month before he would celebrate his 30th year as President.

00:25:32.714 --> 00:25:36.434
And it would be almost two years later, in Singapore on the

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:41.524
6th September 2019, aged 95 that he would take his last breath.

00:25:42.514 --> 00:25:48.314
So, what had Zimbabwe’s great anti-colonial liberator turned tyrant left behind?

00:25:49.064 --> 00:25:54.350
A country ravaged by drought and starvation; a culture of political corruption,

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.490
abductions and murders; a loss of faith in the electoral system; widespread

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:05.520
poverty; skyrocketing inflation; and the mass exodus of young Zimbabweans abroad.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:11.990
After fighting so long and hard to win independence from the British, Mugabe had spent the

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:18.780
majority of his time in office desperately trying to hold onto it - consolidating power, silencing

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:25.250
critics, and putting his own interests above those of the country he claimed to love and represent.

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:31.500
He was a man who would stop at nothing to stay in control, and perhaps

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:36.630
ironically it would be his actions after he took office that overshadowed

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.990
his important role in the birth of Zimbabwe and its independence.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:47.938
So his legacy is, for much of the world, as a dictator and a tyrant,  not

00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:52.548
as he used to be affectionately called in better times, “Uncle Bob”.

00:26:54.606 --> 00:27:00.988
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on Robert Mugabe, the school teacher who became

00:27:00.988 --> 00:27:06.278
a revolutionary anti-colonial leader and then turned into an authoritarian tyrant.

00:27:06.728 --> 00:27:12.118
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about Mugabe and his life before today,

00:27:12.318 --> 00:27:17.118
or this was the first time you’d heard anything about him, well I hope you learned something new.

00:27:17.748 --> 00:27:20.928
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:27:21.278 --> 00:27:22.998
Have you ever been to Zimbabwe?

00:27:23.438 --> 00:27:27.278
Do you know any Zimbabweans who lived through the Mugabe dictatorship?

00:27:27.768 --> 00:27:31.078
Can you think of any other revolutionaries who were corrupted

00:27:31.088 --> 00:27:34.908
by power and became tyrants, or had similar falls from grace?

00:27:35.198 --> 00:27:36.518
I can certainly think of a few.

00:27:37.058 --> 00:27:40.248
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.397 --> 00:00:17.437
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:21.757
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:27.667
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about tea.

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:34.017
It is the second most popular drink in the world, second only to water, and

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:41.237
it’s estimated that 3.7 billion cups of tea are consumed every single day.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.677
I’m drinking one right now, as are hundreds of

00:00:44.687 --> 00:00:48.277
millions of other people, including, perhaps, even you.

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:55.397
So, in this episode we are going to look at how tea became such a global sensation.

00:00:56.027 --> 00:01:01.337
It is an amazing story, it’s one of global trade, East vs.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:10.569
West, opium, theft, addiction, wars, international espionage, smuggling and a Portuguese Princess.

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.769
If you would like to press pause and put the kettle on, now is the time to do so,

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:22.689
as this episode is best listened to with an accompanying cup of your favourite tea.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.489
OK then, let’s get right into it.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.399
Great Britain is said to be a nation of tea drinkers.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.199
We drink it at breakfast, we drink it in the mid-morning, and we drink it in the afternoon.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.919
The average person in Britain drinks about one and a half kilos of the stuff every

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:52.049
year, which will make you about 700 cups, or almost two cups of tea every single day.

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:58.149
And it has become part of British culture, so much so that during World War

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.149
II, as things were not going well for the Allies, the British government

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:08.349
bought up all the tea available in Europe in a bid to keep up morale.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.969
But there is, of course, nothing actually British about tea.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.349
Tea, as you will probably know, originates from China.

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.579
There are several myths about the discovery of tea.

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:31.069
One has a Chinese emperor, Shen Nung, about to drink from a bowl of boiling water, and magically

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.119
some leaves blow into it, he drinks this newly flavoured water and thinks, hmm, that was nice.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.379
Another has Shen Nung accidentally poisoning himself, and just as he was

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:50.089
about to die a leaf blew into his mouth, he chewed it, and he was saved.

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.899
While I’ll leave you to decide whether you believe either of these two stories,

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:01.971
there is evidence of tea being drunk in China going back to the second century BC.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.239
Tea was mainly grown in south-western China, in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.119
And it is thought to have initially been considered to be a medicinal drink, a drink

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:23.189
to be mixed with things like onion, ginger and salt, and drunk for its health benefits.

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:28.989
But as China continued to grow in power, especially during the Tang

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.929
dynasty from the 7th to 10th century, people looked for other uses for tea.

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:41.369
It turned from a medicinal drink to one drunk for similar reasons as

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:46.049
it is drunk today, because it was enjoyable, because it was tasty,

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.399
and because the caffeine in it gave you a little buzz of energy.

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.749
And as the popularity of tea continued to grow within Imperial China, it was increasingly

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.799
exported to neighbouring countries: Japan to the east, and the Tibetan empire to the south.

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:11.779
And with the growth of the Silk Road, tea was also introduced to central Asia and the Middle East.

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:19.609
It was a popular drink, and countries began to put their own mark on how tea should be drunk.

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.249
In China, it was typically drunk plain - green tea mixed with hot water.

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:31.799
In the mountainous Tibetan region they added Yak milk to it.

00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:38.289
In Japan there was an intricate ritual developed to do with the preparation of tea.

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:44.889
But it was to be in 1610 that tea took its first step to

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.189
becoming a drink that would literally change the world.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:56.849
Dutch merchants brought tea to Amsterdam, the first tea leaves arrived on northern European shores.

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.589
When it first arrived, people weren’t so convinced.

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.339
Sure, it was exotic, and therefore there was interest in trying it.

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:12.799
But it was incredibly expensive, and it was, like coffee,

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:16.639
initially thought to be a medicinal drink by Europeans.

00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:22.071
The first records of tea arriving in Britain came shortly after, but

00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:26.811
the Brits weren’t overly convinced about these new, green leaves either.

00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:35.141
Tea only really started to take off in Britain after Charles II took the throne in 1660.

00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:43.071
To briefly remind you, Charles II was the king nicknamed “The Merry Monarch”.

00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:49.931
He was crowned king after the country had spent 11 years experimenting with life without a

00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:56.751
monarch, and after it had decided to restore the monarchy, the crown was placed on Charles’ head.

00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:02.301
The country was ready for a good time, and Charles was a party animal.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.920
He reopened the theatres, allowed music to be played again,

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.020
and there was a general mood of celebration in the air.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.710
His wife was Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese princess.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.690
Now, Portuguese merchants had brought tea back a little earlier than the Dutch, so

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.240
the Portuguese nobility had had a bit more time to develop a taste for the stuff.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.570
And Catherine of Braganza was someone who had certainly developed a taste for it.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.820
She was a huge fan of tea, and she brought it with

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.927
her when she moved to England to marry Charles II.

00:06:43.013 --> 00:06:47.790
In those days the King and Queen were the most fashionable people in

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.040
the country, and if you wanted to show that you were fashionable and

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.340
a person of high reputation, you did what the King and Queen did.

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.940
You went to the same places as they did, you wore the same clothes, and you drank the same drinks.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.660
So all of high society, in an attempt to do what

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.042
Catherine of Braganza was doing, started to drink tea.

00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:16.022
Demand for tea did increase, but given that it was

00:07:16.022 --> 00:07:19.402
such an expensive drink few people could afford it.

00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:24.832
The only place in the world that produced tea at this time was

00:07:24.832 --> 00:07:29.312
China, so British merchants needed to go to China to get it.

00:07:30.102 --> 00:07:34.512
And at the time a monopoly on British trade with China had

00:07:34.512 --> 00:07:38.432
been given to an organisation called The East India Company.

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:45.842
The East India Company, given that British aristocrats had started to develop a taste

00:07:45.892 --> 00:07:52.142
for the stuff, started to buy tea from Chinese merchants in Canton, modern day Guangzhou.

00:07:53.192 --> 00:07:56.452
This was the only port with which foreign trade was

00:07:56.452 --> 00:08:00.892
allowed - so the entire tea trade needed to pass through here.

00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:06.882
But for the first 30 years or so of its existence in Britain, tea

00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:10.892
was so expensive that only the richest in society could afford it.

00:08:11.772 --> 00:08:20.552
Then, over the next 50 years, so this is from around 1690 to 1740, tea

00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:25.812
went from the preserve of the upper classes to a truly national drink.

00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:32.022
In 1690 around 50 tonnes of tea were imported to Britain, but

00:08:32.232 --> 00:08:39.332
by 1740 it had gone to 2,500 tonnes, an increase of 50 times.

00:08:40.622 --> 00:08:44.622
Given the amount that was being imported, the cost had reduced,

00:08:44.892 --> 00:08:48.492
meaning that it was now something that normal people could afford.

00:08:49.602 --> 00:08:55.682
It was also a very easy drink to make, you simply boil water and add it to the tea.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:09:02.282
If you compare this to the other hot drinks available, coffee or hot chocolate,

00:09:02.462 --> 00:09:08.482
hot cocoa, tea was much easier to prepare, and it became part of British culture.

00:09:09.422 --> 00:09:15.302
The British also added their own twist, their own unique style, to tea preparation.

00:09:15.962 --> 00:09:22.142
They added sugar, and unlike in east Asia, tea became a sweet drink.

00:09:23.032 --> 00:09:27.992
Indeed, if you look at the amount of tea imported to Britain every year,

00:09:28.262 --> 00:09:33.342
it increases at almost exactly the same rate as the imports of sugar.

00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:38.682
Now, we are still in the early 18th century here, but we can

00:09:38.702 --> 00:09:42.702
already see quite how interlinked the global economy already is.

00:09:43.652 --> 00:09:47.792
Sugar is being exported from the Caribbean, after having been

00:09:47.992 --> 00:09:52.502
produced in plantations filled with slaves taken from west Africa,

00:09:52.832 --> 00:09:57.702
who were bought from European slave traders with wool and metal goods.

00:09:58.192 --> 00:10:04.802
The sugar then makes its way back to Britain, where it is drunk with a leaf exported from China.

00:10:05.902 --> 00:10:10.222
It is quite horrific to think about, and this is evidently a

00:10:10.232 --> 00:10:15.692
gross simplification, but globalisation was already well underway.

00:10:16.992 --> 00:10:20.662
Now, a functioning global trade system requires

00:10:20.662 --> 00:10:24.092
countries to produce things that other countries want.

00:10:24.892 --> 00:10:28.972
I make product A, you make product B, and then I

00:10:28.992 --> 00:10:32.652
give you some of product A in exchange for product B.

00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:40.712
The only problem with this was that China, the global centre of tea production, wasn’t

00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:47.142
really interested in products that Britain was producing - wool, textiles, and machinery.

00:10:48.402 --> 00:10:53.712
In a famous letter to the British King George III, the Emperor of Imperial

00:10:53.712 --> 00:11:00.482
China, Qianlong, in 1793 wrote: "Our Celestial Empire possesses all

00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:05.072
things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders.

00:11:05.482 --> 00:11:09.402
There is therefore no need to import the manufactures

00:11:09.572 --> 00:11:13.663
of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce.”

00:11:14.651 --> 00:11:18.942
Translation: “we don’t need or want anything you make”.

00:11:20.072 --> 00:11:27.182
And Britain had, to date, been paying for tea with silver, but the silver was running out.

00:11:28.082 --> 00:11:33.782
Britain needed to find a product that it could sell to China in exchange for tea.

00:11:35.182 --> 00:11:37.332
The product was opium.

00:11:38.132 --> 00:11:44.862
Now, opium was illegal in China, but this didn’t stop the British smuggling it into the country.

00:11:45.912 --> 00:11:50.542
More and more Chinese became addicted to the drug, and by

00:11:50.574 --> 00:11:56.002
1840 there were an estimated 10 million Chinese opium addicts.

00:11:57.092 --> 00:12:01.452
You may know the story of what happened next, The Opium Wars.

00:12:02.172 --> 00:12:07.492
We actually made an episode on this, it’s episode number 93, so if you

00:12:07.492 --> 00:12:11.852
want the long version of that story, I’d recommend listening to that.

00:12:12.842 --> 00:12:14.802
But here’s the short version.

00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:21.912
In 1839, a Chinese official named Lin Zexu destroyed 1,000

00:12:21.972 --> 00:12:25.592
tonnes of opium that had been seized from British smugglers.

00:12:26.472 --> 00:12:30.972
Britain rushed to the defense of these drug smugglers, and between

00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:37.642
1839 and 1860 there were two different wars between Britain and China.

00:12:39.384 --> 00:12:43.604
China wanted Britain to stop flooding its country with opium.

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:52.774
Britain needed the opium trade to continue, because its population was also addicted, albeit to tea.

00:12:54.224 --> 00:12:59.274
To cut a long story short, these wars were won by Britain, and

00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:03.394
resulted in the so-called Century of Humiliation for China.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:09.934
As far as tea is concerned, the British continued to flood China with

00:13:09.954 --> 00:13:15.524
opium, which allowed them to continue to buy vast quantities of tea.

00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:18.884
But this wasn’t a long term solution.

00:13:20.114 --> 00:13:24.094
While all of this had been going on, Britain had been desperately

00:13:24.104 --> 00:13:28.864
trying to find a way to produce tea in its rapidly-growing empire.

00:13:30.124 --> 00:13:35.314
The problem was that Britain had no idea how tea was actually produced.

00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:42.414
Given that the British traders only saw the final version of tea, the dried out

00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:49.076
leaves ready to be exported, they had no real idea how tea actually went from

00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:54.796
being a plant growing on a bush to the final product that you add to hot water.

00:13:55.916 --> 00:14:01.396
The British even thought that green and black tea were two completely different

00:14:01.446 --> 00:14:07.786
plants, and that different varieties of tea came from a very large variety of plants.

00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:12.866
In case you didn’t know, black tea is oxidised, when

00:14:13.016 --> 00:14:16.006
green tea isn’t - they come from the same plant.

00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:19.616
So, what did the British do?

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:26.496
They sent spies deep into China to try to see tea production for themselves.

00:14:27.896 --> 00:14:33.656
The most famous of these spies was a Scotsman called Robert Fortune, who travelled

00:14:33.696 --> 00:14:40.056
deep into China, disguised as a Chinese peasant, and learned how tea was actually made.

00:14:41.286 --> 00:14:46.366
I’m not quite sure how a very Caucasian-looking Scotsman managed to

00:14:46.366 --> 00:14:51.996
successfully disguise himself as a Chinese peasant, but apparently it worked.

00:14:52.906 --> 00:14:58.966
He managed to learn the secrets of tea production, and escape from China with tea plants.

00:15:00.046 --> 00:15:05.656
And it was with the tea plants that Fortune had taken from China, and with the

00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:10.926
knowledge he had gained from witnessing the production of tea, that tea started

00:15:10.946 --> 00:15:16.694
to be produced in British India, specifically, in Assam, in northern India.

00:15:18.134 --> 00:15:21.904
The Chinese stronghold on global tea production was coming

00:15:21.904 --> 00:15:25.904
to an end, and tea production in India continued to grow.

00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:32.214
Armed now with the knowledge of how to produce tea, the British brought

00:15:32.304 --> 00:15:36.994
it to other parts of the empire, for example Sri Lanka and East Africa.

00:15:37.644 --> 00:15:40.794
And the rest is, as they say, history.

00:15:41.684 --> 00:15:45.744
Tea is as popular as it ever has been, and as we

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:49.544
heard, literally billions of people drink it every day.

00:15:50.374 --> 00:15:55.654
Now, I want to finish off this episode with three curiosities about tea.

00:15:56.604 --> 00:16:03.564
The first is linguistic, and it’s about what the word for tea tells you in any language.

00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:09.264
There are three broad groups of ways of saying tea:

00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:14.034
The first is “te”, so in English we say “tea”, in

00:16:14.034 --> 00:16:17.624
French you say “thé”, in Spanish it’s “té”, and so on.

00:16:18.804 --> 00:16:23.564
The second is “cha”, so in Mandarin it’s “chá”, in

00:16:23.564 --> 00:16:27.384
Japanese it’s “cha”, and in Portuguese it’s also “chá”.

00:16:28.194 --> 00:16:32.794
And the third is more like “chai”, so in Russian, Arabic,

00:16:32.844 --> 00:16:37.304
and Persian, the word for tea sounds a bit like chai.

00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:43.364
The interesting thing about this is that the way a language

00:16:43.604 --> 00:16:48.634
says “tea” tells you about how tea probably entered the country.

00:16:49.714 --> 00:16:55.674
If the word is something like “tea”, it will have come from south-east China, in or around

00:16:55.674 --> 00:17:02.584
Fujian province, as “te” is the word in the Min group of languages spoken in this area of China.

00:17:03.674 --> 00:17:09.714
If the word is something like “cha”, it will either have come from the original Chinese word,

00:17:09.894 --> 00:17:16.584
in the case of Japanese or Korean, or have come from the traders in Canton, in southern China.

00:17:17.504 --> 00:17:22.414
Interestingly, the reason that Portuguese is the only European language

00:17:22.514 --> 00:17:27.274
to have this root is thanks to early Portuguese traders in Macau.

00:17:28.174 --> 00:17:34.784
And if the word is something like “chai”, it will likely have come overland, through the

00:17:34.794 --> 00:17:41.584
Silk Road, which explains why Middle Eastern and Slavic languages typically use this version.

00:17:42.804 --> 00:17:48.044
OK, our second curiosity about tea is the story of tea bags.

00:17:49.414 --> 00:17:55.664
Nowadays, most pre-packaged tea, certainly in Europe, comes in tea bags.

00:17:55.834 --> 00:18:00.354
You put the tea bag in a cup, add water, then take it out, and you

00:18:00.354 --> 00:18:03.864
don’t need to worry about dealing with all of the little leaves.

00:18:04.144 --> 00:18:05.344
It’s convenient.

00:18:06.004 --> 00:18:11.944
But it might surprise you that tea bags were discovered completely by accident.

00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:21.164
In 1908, an American tea merchant called Thomas Sullivan sent small samples of tea to his customers.

00:18:21.774 --> 00:18:26.524
He enclosed them in little silk bags, assuming that the customers

00:18:26.524 --> 00:18:31.574
would take the tea leaves out and prepare the tea in a metal infuser.

00:18:32.574 --> 00:18:37.554
But the customers just put the entire bag into hot water, not

00:18:37.554 --> 00:18:40.514
realising that they were meant to take the tea leaves out.

00:18:41.694 --> 00:18:45.314
It tasted just as good, and there was none of the mess.

00:18:46.244 --> 00:18:51.674
So, Sullivan started mass-producing these little bags, no longer made

00:18:51.694 --> 00:18:56.194
out of silk, of course, and that was how the tea bag was invented.

00:18:57.594 --> 00:19:01.834
Our final curiosity is perhaps more of a point of debate,

00:19:02.104 --> 00:19:05.674
and that is about how you actually make a cup of tea.

00:19:06.304 --> 00:19:12.084
Do you put the water in first, the milk first, the bag first, and how

00:19:12.124 --> 00:19:16.434
long do you leave it to brew, how long do you leave the bag in there?

00:19:17.164 --> 00:19:23.204
Well, I can assure you that there are conversations happening about this very topic in

00:19:23.214 --> 00:19:29.779
British households right now, but here are three tips from a so-called tea-making expert.

00:19:30.846 --> 00:19:37.626
Firstly, always drink from a porcelain or ceramic cup, never from a styrofoam one.

00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:43.525
The styrofoam actually absorbs flavour molecules, reducing the taste.

00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:50.075
Secondly, always use filtered water, as if you use hardened

00:19:50.075 --> 00:19:53.835
water then the flavour of the tea will react with the calcium.

00:19:54.315 --> 00:19:58.195
And add the water first, then the tea, and then the milk.

00:19:58.965 --> 00:20:03.815
And the final tip, which some of you might find surprising, is

00:20:03.815 --> 00:20:08.825
to leave the teabag in the hot water for at least 5 minutes.

00:20:09.715 --> 00:20:14.765
You might think that the tea would be horrendously strong and disgusting, but

00:20:14.955 --> 00:20:20.655
according to a literal expert in the science of tea making, this is the way to do it.

00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:29.755
So, that is our not-so-short history of tea, a drink with mysterious origins, one that went from

00:20:29.755 --> 00:20:35.625
the preserve of emperors and the ultra-rich to being the second most popular drink in the world.

00:20:36.205 --> 00:20:39.995
Along the way it altered global politics, caused countries

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:43.845
to go to war with each other, and changed the world.

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:47.565
It’s certainly something to think about when you next put

00:20:47.585 --> 00:20:51.475
the kettle on, ready to enjoy a refreshing cup of tea.

00:20:53.225 --> 00:20:57.865
OK then, that is it for today's episode on tea.

00:20:58.195 --> 00:21:01.625
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:05.905
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:06.295 --> 00:21:09.875
We do have an increasing number of members from China, so I

00:21:09.875 --> 00:21:13.155
would particularly love to know what your thoughts on this were.

00:21:13.635 --> 00:21:20.695
What do you see as the role of tea in Chinese culture today, and is it strange for you that

00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:26.395
it has been semi-adopted as a national drink by a country on the other side of the world?

00:21:27.235 --> 00:21:33.895
And for everyone else, from whichever country you are from, what role does tea play in your culture?

00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:38.565
I know we have focussed on Britain and tea here, so I’d love

00:21:38.565 --> 00:21:42.385
to hear any interesting stories about tea and your country.

00:21:43.195 --> 00:21:45.075

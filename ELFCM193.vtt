Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.737 --> 00:00:16.477
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:21.007
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:25.887
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:31.197
Spartacus, the man who led a gladiator uprising in Ancient Rome.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:35.957
Now, you probably know something of the story of Spartacus.

00:00:36.237 --> 00:00:42.707
Perhaps you learned about him at school, perhaps you’ve seen the cult 1960 film with

00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:49.837
Kirk Douglas, or perhaps you have seen a more recent TV series loosely based on his life.

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:54.848
His story has inspired philosophers, politicians, athletes,

00:00:54.878 --> 00:00:59.178
and people just like me and you for thousands of years.

00:00:59.398 --> 00:01:03.938
So, in this episode we are going to tell the story of Spartcaus.

00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:07.278
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:08.788 --> 00:01:15.768
Ancient Rome had many great qualities that much of the world still looks on with admiration.

00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:23.408
Republicanism, the idea that citizenship shouldn’t be tied to ethnicity, great literature and

00:01:23.408 --> 00:01:29.828
philosophy, beautiful buildings, aqueducts, and roads that are still partly standing today.

00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:37.268
But two things that are not universally admired from ancient Rome are slavery and

00:01:37.278 --> 00:01:44.428
gladiators - the idea that a human being can be the property of another human being, and the

00:01:44.428 --> 00:01:51.688
idea that it is not just acceptable, but enjoyable to watch two humans fight to the death.

00:01:52.638 --> 00:01:56.838
Now, of course ancient Rome wasn't the first, and wasn’t the

00:01:56.948 --> 00:02:01.238
only society to keep slaves or force people to kill each other.

00:02:01.528 --> 00:02:04.058
But it is one of the most famous.

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:08.558
I should clarify that to say that gladiators and slavery

00:02:08.688 --> 00:02:13.088
are two completely different concepts is not exactly true.

00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:18.358
Most gladiators were slaves, they were people who had been captured

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:23.898
by the Romans, often from far off lands, and had been sold as slaves.

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:31.688
These male slaves would often be sent to camps, where they would be trained as gladiators.

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:37.858
The topic of gladiators deserves its own episode, but as a brief summary,

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:43.778
promising slaves, men who were considered to be strong and able fighters, would

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:48.478
be sent to these gladiator schools where they would be trained as a gladiator.

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:54.158
When they were considered sufficiently trained, they would be sent out to fight.

00:02:54.668 --> 00:03:00.608
If they won, and by won, we of course normally mean if they killed their

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:05.438
opponents or were not killed themselves, they would live to fight another day.

00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:11.318
And if they lost, well this almost always meant death.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.386
So the status of a gladiator in ancient Rome was a strange one.

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:23.826
On the one hand they were slaves or criminals, people who were right at the bottom

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:29.516
of society and forced to fight to the death for the entertainment of others.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:34.256
They couldn’t leave, they weren’t free, they were still owned by their master.

00:03:34.773 --> 00:03:39.436
But on the other hand they were often treated very well inside these schools.

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:46.056
Their masters wanted them to win, partly because they would win fame and glory if their

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:52.886
gladiator won, and partly because if their gladiator lost, well the slave owner would

00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:58.416
lose valuable property, the gladiator would be worthless because he would be dead.

00:03:59.036 --> 00:04:04.656
Despite the gladiator’s status as a man in captivity, the most successful

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:10.106
gladiators had a fame that one could compare to a modern sports star.

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:16.296
They were cheered on, they had fans, and lived a pretty good life inside these schools.

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:22.076
One of the most famous of these schools was located in a place

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:28.186
called Capua, about 25km to the north of Naples, in southern Italy.

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:34.266
In 73 BC, in the gladiatorial school in Capua, a

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:38.476
gladiator named Spartacus had been planning his escape.

00:04:39.156 --> 00:04:46.596
Not much is known about Spartacus’ early life, other than he probably came from Thrace,

00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:52.756
an area of Eastern Europe split between modern day Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey.

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:58.126
He had probably been captured by the Romans, and sold into slavery.

00:04:58.866 --> 00:05:05.186
What we do know is that in 73 BC, when Spartacus was probably in his

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:11.676
late 30s, he and a group of around 70 other gladiators managed to

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:17.006
overpower their captors and break out of the gladiator school in Capua.

00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:21.256
The story goes that they managed to overpower their

00:05:21.256 --> 00:05:24.966
guards using some knives that they found in the kitchen.

00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:30.132
As soon as they got out of the school they found a caravan of

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:34.752
trucks that was full of weapons for these trainee gladiators.

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:39.462
Weapons that were deadly, but of course only intended

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:42.512
to be used within the school for training purposes.

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:51.092
Spartacus and his group of 70 or so escapees were now armed and dangerous.

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:57.982
They were all professional gladiators, they were men whose job was literally to fight and

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:04.542
kill other people, and they now knew that if they were captured, certain death awaited them.

00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:13.072
The group headed south towards Mount Vesuvius, the volcano that overlooks the bay of Naples.

00:06:13.922 --> 00:06:19.896
This was about 150 years before the famous eruption that destroyed Pompeii,

00:06:20.452 --> 00:06:26.232
and at the time Mount Vesuvius was a lush region full of olive trees.

00:06:27.142 --> 00:06:31.222
As the group moved south, they were joined by other slaves

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:34.342
who had run away from their masters to join the group.

00:06:35.102 --> 00:06:41.042
There is this romantic idea that was popularised by the 1960 film that

00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:46.102
Spartacus had the goal of abolishing slavery throughout the Roman empire,

00:06:46.102 --> 00:06:52.172
that he was filled with this dream to get rid of this horrible practice.

00:06:52.832 --> 00:06:57.882
Although this might have been a noble aim, there is no evidence that it was true.

00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:02.562
The slaves who ran away to join the gladiators, in all

00:07:02.562 --> 00:07:07.052
probability, weren’t doing it because of their anti-slavery views.

00:07:07.682 --> 00:07:13.122
More likely is that slaves saw that Spartacus’s group was growing, that they were

00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:18.622
living a better life than the slaves were, so they risked it all to join Spartacus.

00:07:19.552 --> 00:07:25.372
When news got back to Rome of this escape from the school, something had to be done.

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:31.362
A signal needed to be sent to this rebellious group, and to potential future

00:07:31.362 --> 00:07:36.542
rebels, that one could not escape from gladiator school and get away with it.

00:07:38.352 --> 00:07:42.992
A man called Gaius Claudius Glaber was sent to deal with the escaped

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:48.692
gladiators, but he wasn’t even given an army - he had to find 3,000 men

00:07:48.702 --> 00:07:53.272
on his way south, he had to form his own army to fight the gladiators.

00:07:53.892 --> 00:07:59.732
This gives you an idea of how little threat Rome thought Spartacus posed.

00:08:00.732 --> 00:08:07.102
On the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, Glaber and his men surrounded Spartacus and blocked his path.

00:08:07.672 --> 00:08:11.222
On one side Spartacus saw the Roman soldiers.

00:08:11.682 --> 00:08:14.122
On the other was a steep cliff.

00:08:14.992 --> 00:08:21.662
In a display of the excellent military strategy that Spartacus would later prove to have, he

00:08:21.662 --> 00:08:28.662
ordered his men to make ropes out of vines, so they could lower themselves down the cliffs.

00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:34.262
They then went round the back of the Roman camp without Glaber noticing,

00:08:34.502 --> 00:08:39.862
and were able to use the element of surprise to massacre the Roman soldiers.

00:08:40.782 --> 00:08:45.662
This was the first of the real victories for Spartacus, and as

00:08:45.672 --> 00:08:50.612
word got out, more and more slaves flocked to join the army.

00:08:51.282 --> 00:08:56.822
Spartacus was now the de facto leader of the group, although power was shared with

00:08:56.892 --> 00:09:03.032
two other gladiators, gauls from modern day France called Crixus and Oenomaus.

00:09:03.862 --> 00:09:06.762
You might be thinking, “why didn’t the Romans just

00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:09.992
send their real army to deal with the gladiators?”

00:09:10.432 --> 00:09:15.202
Well, at least when Spartacus escaped from Capua most of the Roman

00:09:15.232 --> 00:09:20.692
army was far away in the empire fighting, in Spain, Gaul and Germany.

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:26.192
The most serious threats were on the edges of the empire, so that

00:09:26.192 --> 00:09:30.012
was where the best trained, and majority of the soldiers were.

00:09:31.052 --> 00:09:35.792
Spartacus’s army, and by this time we can probably call it an army,

00:09:36.132 --> 00:09:40.622
marched north from Vesuvius, moving up Italy towards The Alps.

00:09:41.412 --> 00:09:44.882
As it went, it attracted more and more men to it.

00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:49.252
It must have been an attractive proposition for a slave.

00:09:49.392 --> 00:09:52.742
The army was no longer a group of a couple of hundred

00:09:52.862 --> 00:09:58.092
escaped gladiators, it had swelled to around 40,000 men.

00:09:58.832 --> 00:10:05.072
It was, by all reports, a relatively democratic army, and when treasures

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:09.832
were taken from Roman towns or villas, they were shared between the soldiers.

00:10:10.672 --> 00:10:16.852
If you were someone living as a slave, in pretty terrible conditions, then it’s not

00:10:16.872 --> 00:10:22.672
hard to imagine the attraction of running away from your masters and joining the rebels.

00:10:23.342 --> 00:10:29.392
Indeed, there are historians who have suggested that it wasn’t just slaves that joined Spartacus

00:10:29.392 --> 00:10:35.872
- there were many freed slaves and common people who decided that they too wanted to join.

00:10:36.842 --> 00:10:43.432
By the spring of 72 BC the army was around 70,000 men in total.

00:10:43.962 --> 00:10:47.882
But, factions, different groups, were arising.

00:10:48.412 --> 00:10:54.542
Specifically, one group led by the gaul Crixus, a group of around 30,000

00:10:54.542 --> 00:11:00.412
men, decided to stay behind in central Italy while Spartacus moved north.

00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:07.742
The Roman forces managed to catch up with Crixus, and by this time they were better prepared.

00:11:08.682 --> 00:11:11.252
Crixus and his men were slaughtered.

00:11:11.432 --> 00:11:13.902
The rebels had lost nearly half of their men.

00:11:14.842 --> 00:11:18.972
But the group led by Spartacus continued to march north.

00:11:19.772 --> 00:11:27.052
Historians suggest that Spartacus was trying to lead his men out of modern day Italy, back towards

00:11:27.222 --> 00:11:34.262
Thrace, where Spartacus came from, while the ones from Gaul would go there, in modern day France.

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:38.482
Put simply, Spartacus was trying to go home.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:43.769
Strangely enough when Spartacus’s army got to the Alps,

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:47.909
they turned around and went south, back towards Rome.

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:49.529
Why?

00:11:50.059 --> 00:11:54.919
Well, that is a great question, and nobody actually knows why.

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:58.869
There are several theories that historians have put forward.

00:11:59.369 --> 00:12:04.009
The Italian peninsula was the richest place in Europe at the time.

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:08.279
The gladiators had enjoyed a lot of success by taking

00:12:08.289 --> 00:12:11.719
gold and other treasure from villages they had attacked.

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:15.629
Why leave, when it seemed so easy to get rich?

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:21.159
Perhaps they were so drunk on their own success that they really thought that

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:26.599
they could march on Rome, capture the city, and seize power for themselves.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.689
It might seem crazy to us now, but they hadn’t been defeated

00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:35.619
so far, why couldn’t they keep on going and take the capital?

00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:40.677
And not all of the rebels came from Thrace or Gaul.

00:12:40.941 --> 00:12:44.589
Spartacus might have been going “home”, but not everyone was.

00:12:45.589 --> 00:12:51.009
By this point, for many, home would have been with the other rebels, they were having a

00:12:51.009 --> 00:12:56.429
lot of fun, and they didn’t want to go to a place that was completely foreign to them.

00:12:57.319 --> 00:13:03.699
And finally, perhaps they saw the Alps and thought, wow, that looks dangerous.

00:13:03.959 --> 00:13:07.829
If you haven’t been to northern Italy before and seen the

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:11.979
start of the Alps, they do almost come out of nowhere.

00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:18.439
To someone who had never seen mountains like that before, one couldn’t blame them if they wanted to

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:25.349
take their chance against the Roman army instead of trying to go across dangerous snowy mountains.

00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:29.259
So, they turned back, and marched south.

00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:34.179
Their target was Sicily, at the other end of the Italian peninsula.

00:13:35.579 --> 00:13:39.879
Sicily had a history of slave rebellions, it was also an

00:13:39.929 --> 00:13:44.189
island, so partly separated from the rest of the Roman empire.

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:51.899
Spartacus’s plan was to get to Sicily, where he hoped he would find sympathy with his cause.

00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:55.729
But Rome was not going to allow this to happen.

00:13:56.519 --> 00:14:00.339
One of the richest people in Rome, a man named Marcus

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:04.499
Crassus, was chosen to make sure Spartacus never got there.

00:14:05.259 --> 00:14:11.079
He raised an army, and set off to defeat the rebels, once and for all.

00:14:12.119 --> 00:14:18.789
Crassus knew that Spartacus’s forces were in a place called Picenum, or Picenum, as

00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:24.459
I am told it should be pronounced in the authentic Roman way, on the Adriatic coast.

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:27.949
He sent one of his lieutenants, complete with two

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:32.809
legions, so around 10,000 men, to push Spartacus north.

00:14:33.409 --> 00:14:38.939
They were given specific instructions not to attack Spartacus’s army,

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:44.059
just to push him north, where they would face another, larger, army.

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:51.519
This lieutenant, a man named Mummius, got ahead of himself, he was too confident.

00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:57.339
Instead of pushing Spartacus’s forces north, he attacked.

00:14:57.849 --> 00:15:05.199
Miscalculating the strength of Spartacus’s army, Mummius’s two legions were badly defeated.

00:15:05.959 --> 00:15:11.239
The survivors returned to the main army, to tell their commander what had happened.

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:14.579
Crassus was furious.

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:22.889
His direct orders had been disobeyed, and he wanted to make sure that this would never happen again.

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:28.799
Of the 500 soldiers who returned alive, they were divided into groups

00:15:28.849 --> 00:15:35.309
of 10, and one person in each group was chosen to be publicly executed.

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:42.159
The idea was that the soldiers would fear their own commander more than

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:46.289
they would fear Spartacus, and they would never disobey orders again.

00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:54.859
The word for this punishment is, you might know, decimate, meaning to take one out of every ten.

00:15:56.239 --> 00:16:00.179
The word in English today has gone on to mean “completely

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:04.459
destroy”, but this type of punishment is where it comes from.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.289
While Crassus was busy disciplining his army,

00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:12.159
Spartacus’s army had managed to progress further south.

00:16:13.089 --> 00:16:18.399
They had almost reached Sicily, but needed to find a way across the straits

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:24.689
of Messina, the 3km body of water between Sicily and the Italian peninsula.

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:31.529
The only option available to Spartacus was to get Sicilian pirates to help them cross.

00:16:32.009 --> 00:16:36.459
The pirates had fast boats and knowledge of good places to land.

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:43.569
Spartacus’s army had plenty of money, taken during their attacks on Roman towns and villages.

00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:52.019
Spartacus paid the pirates to help him cross, but he was betrayed at the last minute, the

00:16:52.019 --> 00:16:58.129
pirates sailed off with the money, leaving Spartacus and his army stuck on the mainland.

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:03.889
This part of the Italian peninsula, the foot, is long and thin.

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:09.339
Spartacus’s forces were trapped, and Crassus’s army was fast approaching.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:16.449
What’s more, a legendary Roman general called Pompey The Great was on his way to support.

00:17:17.729 --> 00:17:23.239
While Spartacus and his group of gladiators had had success against smaller

00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:28.889
Roman forces, and against people who were essentially civilians, coming up

00:17:28.929 --> 00:17:34.309
against the full force of the Roman army would be a different thing altogether.

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:41.619
Spartacus tried to make a deal, he tried to make peace with Crassus, but was rejected.

00:17:42.119 --> 00:17:48.269
Crassus wanted the glory of defeating Spartacus for himself, and he knew that if

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:53.579
Spartacus was only defeated when Pompey arrived there would be no glory for him.

00:17:54.869 --> 00:18:01.279
As the Roman forces tightened around the gladiators, Spartacus reportedly resorted

00:18:01.329 --> 00:18:07.419
to some particularly violent acts to strike fear into the hearts of his soldiers.

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:12.369
One report has him asking for his horse to be brought to him.

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:17.475
Spartacus, wanting to show to his men that there will be no escape

00:18:17.545 --> 00:18:22.365
from this battle, plunges his sword into the horse, killing the animal.

00:18:23.065 --> 00:18:29.325
Another report has him crucifying a Roman prisoner in front of the gladiators as a

00:18:29.325 --> 00:18:34.495
way of showing his men what will happen to them if they do not defeat the Romans.

00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:39.885
Now, the final stages of the story of Spartacus are a little bit

00:18:40.075 --> 00:18:44.415
unclear, and the two main historical sources, Appian and Plutarch,

00:18:44.495 --> 00:18:49.225
have slightly different accounts, but they both end in a similar way.

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:53.985
Crassus had been building walls and tunnels to stop

00:18:54.065 --> 00:18:57.685
Spartacus’s army from getting around them and escaping north.

00:18:58.305 --> 00:19:02.735
Spartacus and his forces were being pushed into a tighter and

00:19:03.055 --> 00:19:07.745
tighter situation, and eventually they were pressured to fight.

00:19:08.725 --> 00:19:12.104
It was against Crassus’s soldiers that they fought.

00:19:12.345 --> 00:19:17.755
The battle was bloody, and it was a resounding victory for the Romans.

00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:21.945
And as for Spartacus, what happened to him?

00:19:22.665 --> 00:19:28.205
If you’ve seen the iconic 1960 film, you’ll remember exactly how it ended.

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:30.395
Here’s a short clip of it.

00:19:31.206 --> 00:19:31.986
Slaves.

00:19:31.986 --> 00:19:41.586
You were and slaves you remain, but the terrible penalty of crucifixion has been set aside on the

00:19:41.586 --> 00:19:49.916
single condition that you identify the body or the living person of the slave called Spartacus

00:19:50.176 --> 00:20:04.256
I am Spartacus.

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.206
I am Spartacus.

00:20:05.276 --> 00:20:13.936
[everyone saying "I am Spartacus"]

00:20:29.536 --> 00:20:34.656
.  
Yes, all of the soldiers bravely say that they are Spartacus, they

00:20:34.656 --> 00:20:39.006
would rather die than give up the identity of their heroic leader.

00:20:39.796 --> 00:20:43.896
As a result, the Romans crucify them all, including Spartacus.

00:20:45.166 --> 00:20:50.816
Unfortunately this is just Hollywood, there is no evidence that this actually happened.

00:20:51.656 --> 00:20:56.266
Most historians agree that Spartacus was killed on the battlefield,

00:20:56.376 --> 00:21:01.136
and would have been thrown into a mass grave like any other soldier.

00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:06.846
The Roman soldier who killed him might not have even known it was

00:21:06.856 --> 00:21:11.186
Spartacus when they killed him, and certainly now we would have no

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:16.726
chance of identifying who was Spartacus even if the mass grave was found.

00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:22.406
And as for the gladiators who were not killed in the battle, they were

00:21:22.446 --> 00:21:27.756
taken up north to be an example to the world, or at least to other slaves

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:32.486
and gladiators, of what happens when you rise up against your masters.

00:21:33.156 --> 00:21:38.576
From Capua, just north of Naples where the gladiators first escaped, right

00:21:38.576 --> 00:21:45.966
through to Rome, 6,000 of Spartacus’s men were lined up on the side of the road

00:21:46.116 --> 00:21:52.416
and crucified, with their bodies left there for months as an example to others.

00:21:53.296 --> 00:22:00.266
But while Spartacus’s final resting place may never be known, we may never know what he actually

00:22:00.276 --> 00:22:07.436
looked like, or why he did what he did, his story, his legend even, is as strong as ever.

00:22:08.596 --> 00:22:13.976
Of course the film and later on the TV series have helped popularise

00:22:14.186 --> 00:22:19.656
his story, but even before that he was held up as a role model of good

00:22:19.806 --> 00:22:26.086
vs evil, of someone who stood up against the tyranny of Roman slavery.

00:22:26.696 --> 00:22:33.136
Voltaire considered the war Spartacus fought to be the only just war in history.

00:22:33.996 --> 00:22:38.696
Later on, in Soviet Russia he became a cult-like symbol.

00:22:39.636 --> 00:22:44.176
Karl Marx had called him "the most splendid fellow in the whole of ancient

00:22:44.186 --> 00:22:50.506
history" and a "great general, noble character, real representative of the ancient

00:22:50.556 --> 00:22:56.786
proletariat", and a Moscow football club changed its name to become “Spartak” Moscow.

00:22:57.446 --> 00:23:02.716
There was also the Spartacus League, a Marxist movement in Germany during World War I.

00:23:04.066 --> 00:23:11.376
To many, he is an icon, a revolutionary leader who was just trying to do the right thing.

00:23:12.076 --> 00:23:19.206
To some historians, I should add, he is considered to be a selfish rebel, someone who was in essence

00:23:19.246 --> 00:23:26.286
a thief, going up and down the Italian peninsula with his rebels and taking anything he could find.

00:23:26.996 --> 00:23:33.076
While we may never know the true story of Spartacus, what’s most definitely true

00:23:33.286 --> 00:23:38.546
is that he led the biggest slave rebellion in ancient history, and one whose

00:23:38.546 --> 00:23:44.636
story has survived and inspired millions of oppressed people for over 2,000 years.

00:23:45.266 --> 00:23:51.436
And as far as that’s concerned, the legend of Spartacus certainly does live on.

00:23:53.556 --> 00:23:58.506
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Spartacus.

00:23:58.626 --> 00:24:01.906
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new,

00:24:02.016 --> 00:24:07.006
and even if you knew a little bit about this story before, it has helped

00:24:07.016 --> 00:24:11.626
fill in some of the gaps, and it has been fun to remind yourself of it.

00:24:12.286 --> 00:24:15.656
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

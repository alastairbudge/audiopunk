Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.930
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.080
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.950
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.310
place that exists outside American territory, and even the law.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.330
A secret place that holds the ‘worst of the worst’ from terrorist organisations around

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.030
the world, but has also been shown to detain and torture perfectly innocent people.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.330
A place that has been steeped in controversy since the day it opened,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.960
caused concerns for human rights experts and legal scholars around the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.930
world, and has been a political talking point for four American presidents.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.190
I am talking, of course, about Guantanamo Bay.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.250
So, let’s get right into it.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.790
A row of handcuffed men are led into the pen.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.730
Chain link fencing surrounds them, razor sharp barbed wiring stopping any chance of escape.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.100
They wear orange jumpsuits, and their heads are bowed.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.910
Their ears are covered with ear-muffs; their eyes with goggles.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.504
A guard forces them to their knees, and they instinctively lean their hands against the fence.

00:01:36.564 --> 00:01:37.454
Some weep.

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:39.044
Others pray.

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.654
‘But I’m a journalist,’ one of them cries.

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:48.294
A row of guards in military uniform stare silently back.

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:51.144
‘Where are you taking us?’ someone says.

00:01:51.524 --> 00:01:53.234
‘How long will we be here?’

00:01:53.724 --> 00:01:56.114
‘Why are we here?’ asks another.

00:01:57.444 --> 00:02:00.854
None of these men know how long they will be held.

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:04.514
And some of them genuinely don’t know why they’re there.

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:12.914
Welcome to Guantanamo Bay, the secretive and shady headquarters of the West’s ‘War on Terror.’

00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:19.804
Guantanamo Bay is now internationally famous, or rather, internationally

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:25.294
infamous, but until the turn of the 21st century it was barely known.

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:28.424
So first, some background.

00:02:28.664 --> 00:02:29.914
Where actually is it?

00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:37.024
Well, the first surprising point is that this “American Detention Centre” isn’t actually in America.

00:02:38.544 --> 00:02:45.784
It’s in a 117 square km enclave in Guantanamo Province, in southeastern Cuba.

00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:53.004
Now, to explain why the Americans got their hands on this small part of Cuba, we first need to

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:59.714
consider both the history of the Americas and the broader geopolitical picture of the 19th century.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:07.234
After Columbus landed in Cuba in 1492, the island was captured by the Spanish.

00:03:08.044 --> 00:03:11.654
It remained under Spanish control for centuries, apart from

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:15.484
a very brief period when it was captured by the British.

00:03:16.454 --> 00:03:21.134
By the late-19th century, Spain was declining as an

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:25.244
imperial power and began to gradually lose its territories.

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.424
And soon it was dragged into war again.

00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:33.334
Not with its old foe the British, but a new imperial

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:37.004
power emerging at the turn of the century - the USA.

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:44.444
Sensing the power of the Spanish waning, Cuba began to fight for their independence.

00:03:45.344 --> 00:03:49.864
The Americans, sensing an opportunity to strike a blow against their

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:54.384
enemy and finish off the Spanish empire, decided to help the Cubans out.

00:03:55.524 --> 00:03:59.964
Cuba became a front in the ongoing Spanish-American War,

00:04:00.294 --> 00:04:03.204
though most of the fighting was actually in the Philippines.

00:04:04.074 --> 00:04:11.584
In December 1898 when the war ended and the Americans won, Spain was forced to give the U.S.

00:04:11.614 --> 00:04:14.934
control of Cuba and other former territories.

00:04:15.624 --> 00:04:19.494
And then, three years later, Cuba became an independent state.

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:22.184
Well, not entirely.

00:04:23.134 --> 00:04:26.994
As it turns out, gaining complete independence from the world’s

00:04:27.024 --> 00:04:32.384
emerging superpower comes with some strings, some terms and conditions,

00:04:32.744 --> 00:04:37.104
and this came in the form of something called The Platt Amendment.

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:43.944
This required the new Cuban state to rent or sell territory to the United States.

00:04:44.854 --> 00:04:46.874
And you have probably guessed where.

00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:48.204
Guantanamo Bay.

00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:57.234
When it was signed in 1903, the Platt Amendment gave Cuba “ultimate sovereignty” over Guantanamo.

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:03.134
But, in order to get its independence, Cuba had to give the U.S.

00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:06.664
“complete jurisdiction and control” of Guantanamo.

00:05:07.334 --> 00:05:12.994
Essentially, the amendment stated that Guantanamo was ultimately Cuban land,

00:05:13.124 --> 00:05:19.984
it was part of Cuba, but the deal required Cuba to allow the U.S to control it.

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:28.494
This strange arrangement continued until decades later, in 1959, when Fidel Castro came to power.

00:05:29.624 --> 00:05:34.304
Castro’s arrival on the scene caused some uncertainty about the future

00:05:34.304 --> 00:05:38.854
of Guantanamo and the continued presence of American soldiers in Cuba.

00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:44.834
In September of 1960, Castro threatened to kick the Americans

00:05:44.904 --> 00:05:48.874
out of Cuba if they continued to undermine the Cuban economy.

00:05:49.854 --> 00:05:54.364
But he also realised that, if he did so, the Americans could

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:58.974
use it as justification to attack and remove him from power.

00:06:00.034 --> 00:06:03.164
Having seen what the US had done in other countries

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:06.514
around the world, he clearly had reason to be cautious.

00:06:07.604 --> 00:06:12.694
Ultimately Castro decided against it, but didn’t let the issue go away quietly.

00:06:13.684 --> 00:06:17.204
He repeatedly raised the issue of Guantanamo with the Americans,

00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:22.774
and in 1964, he even cut the supply of water off from the area.

00:06:23.844 --> 00:06:30.134
Despite all this, Castro knew what a mismatch war with the U.S would be, and wanting

00:06:30.144 --> 00:06:35.514
to cling onto power, begrudgingly allowed the Americans to stay in Guantanamo Bay.

00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:40.434
And this arrangement remained relatively unknown to the

00:06:40.434 --> 00:06:43.694
rest of the world until the turn of the 21st century.

00:06:44.894 --> 00:06:50.494
That’s when the detention centre was opened, and in order to understand the reason for

00:06:50.494 --> 00:06:55.544
this, we need a bit more modern historical context that you’re probably familiar with.

00:06:56.854 --> 00:07:02.144
Shortly after the United States suffered the deadly twin towers attacks on September

00:07:02.144 --> 00:07:10.014
the 11th of 2001, the then US president, George W Bush, issued a military order on the

00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:16.534
“Detention, Treatment and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens, in the War Against Terrorism”.

00:07:17.934 --> 00:07:25.274
Simply put, what this did was allow the US to hold foreign nationals in custody without charging

00:07:25.274 --> 00:07:31.124
them for as long as they wanted without the right to legal process to challenge their detention.

00:07:32.482 --> 00:07:37.072
Or put even more simply, if you weren’t a US citizen and

00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:40.992
you were accused of terrorism, normal laws didn’t apply.

00:07:42.132 --> 00:07:46.592
And where did the US intend on holding these people suspected of terrorism?

00:07:47.282 --> 00:07:49.022
That’s right - Guantanamo Bay.

00:07:50.372 --> 00:07:54.472
According to the American Civil Liberties Union, Guantanamo Bay was

00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:59.592
“intended to be an ‘island outside the law’ where terrorism suspects

00:07:59.722 --> 00:08:04.242
could be detained without process and be interrogated without restraint.”

00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:12.732
And a few months after the 9/11 attacks, in December of 2001, the US Justice department

00:08:12.952 --> 00:08:19.132
stated the prisoners that would be held at Guantanamo Bay were not eligible for something

00:08:19.132 --> 00:08:24.262
called “habeas corpus legal rights”, because they would not be on American soil.

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:29.902
Essentially, this means that they could be detained, kept there, without a trial.

00:08:31.362 --> 00:08:38.562
Shortly after, on January 11th 2002, the first prisoners arrived at Guantanamo Bay.

00:08:39.712 --> 00:08:43.032
They were held outside in mesh cages.

00:08:43.182 --> 00:08:45.342
You have probably seen pictures of this.

00:08:46.552 --> 00:08:52.542
A week later, on January 18th, The International Committee of the Red Cross visited Guantanamo

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:59.432
Bay, but on the very same day, the US government decided that the detainees at Guantanamo

00:08:59.682 --> 00:09:06.382
were not, in fact, prisoners of war and therefore were not protected by the Geneva Convention.

00:09:07.322 --> 00:09:09.282
Most certainly convenient timing.

00:09:10.722 --> 00:09:16.252
In any case, almost as soon as the first prisoners arrived, there were concerned

00:09:16.262 --> 00:09:21.136
voices in the international community about the treatment of the people detained there.

00:09:22.342 --> 00:09:23.942
The American response?

00:09:24.572 --> 00:09:28.962
Rather than make any great claims about the prisoners’ humane treatment,

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:34.162
the US policy was to continue to tell the country, and the wider world,

00:09:34.482 --> 00:09:38.112
that everything was being done in the interests of public safety.

00:09:39.242 --> 00:09:45.372
With the 9/11 attacks so fresh in collective memory, the then US Vice President,

00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:51.722
Dick Cheney, described the men in Guantanamo as “the worst of a very bad lot.”

00:09:52.342 --> 00:09:54.022
“They are very dangerous,” he said.

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:57.752
“Devoted to killing millions of Americans.”

00:09:58.902 --> 00:10:05.422
And, as a result, everything possible should be done to get information from them about other

00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:11.052
terrorists still out in the wild who were also devoted to killing millions of Americans.

00:10:12.022 --> 00:10:17.272
So, on March the 21st of 2002, new military tribunal rules were

00:10:17.272 --> 00:10:22.592
created, and later that year, in August, a memorandum from the U.S.

00:10:22.592 --> 00:10:27.392
Department of Justice advised that “enhanced interrogation techniques”

00:10:27.582 --> 00:10:33.052
would not amount to torture and therefore not be illegal under American law.

00:10:34.152 --> 00:10:39.062
What’s more, the legal cover of “necessity” and “self-defence” could

00:10:39.062 --> 00:10:43.672
be used to defend against any criminal charges, should torture happen.

00:10:44.992 --> 00:10:51.752
In plain English, the US was essentially saying that, at Guantanamo, anything goes.

00:10:52.272 --> 00:10:56.562
American laws didn’t apply, nor did the Geneva Convention.

00:10:57.892 --> 00:11:04.582
And Guantanamo has had its fair share of scandals and controversy over the years, as you will know.

00:11:05.822 --> 00:11:11.522
The British newspaper The Independent reported that the guards in Guantanamo used

00:11:11.834 --> 00:11:17.372
‘Abu Ghraib-style torture’ and sexual humiliation in which prisoners were stripped

00:11:17.412 --> 00:11:23.652
naked, forced to sodomise one another and taunted by female American soldiers.

00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:30.962
Abu Ghraib, by the way, was an Iraqi prison where the US Army and CIA committed a whole

00:11:30.972 --> 00:11:37.512
host of war crimes including mental, physical and sexual abuse, rape, torture and murder.

00:11:38.352 --> 00:11:40.872
This was the framework for Guantanamo.

00:11:42.032 --> 00:11:48.432
Perhaps unsurprisingly, many of the prisoners held in Guantanamo tried to take their own lives.

00:11:49.682 --> 00:11:55.412
By October of 2003, the Red Cross reported a “worrying deterioration” in the

00:11:55.412 --> 00:12:01.722
mental health of detainees, and according to the ACLU, the American Civil Liberties

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:06.482
Union, over the years there have been several suicides and hunger strikes.

00:12:07.242 --> 00:12:14.192
At one point, 103 detainees were on hunger strike, with 41 of those being force fed.

00:12:15.182 --> 00:12:21.242
Yet, the US Defence Secretary, a man named Donald Rumsfeld, approved the use of

00:12:21.412 --> 00:12:28.072
sensory deprivation, dogs, isolation, and stress positions - such as forcing someone

00:12:28.092 --> 00:12:33.072
to crouch in an uncomfortable or unnatural position for a prolonged period of time.

00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:42.938
By the end of 2003 there were 680 detainees being held in Guantanamo, and by February of 2004 the

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:49.858
first legal charges were made - two Sudanese men were charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes.

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:55.038
For those not charged with any crimes, understandably,

00:12:55.038 --> 00:12:58.438
they were pretty fed up of this torture-filled limbo.

00:12:59.478 --> 00:13:05.768
In October of 2004, four British former detainees began legal action

00:13:05.898 --> 00:13:10.628
against the American government and requested $9 million in compensation.

00:13:11.568 --> 00:13:18.878
In March of 2005, 38 detainees were judged to be “no longer enemy combatants”

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:23.298
and were made eligible for release, they were let out of Guantanamo.

00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:29.498
But these releases did little to quell the international condemnation that was

00:13:29.498 --> 00:13:36.798
building, and in February of 2006 a UN report recommended that Guantanamo be closed.

00:13:37.938 --> 00:13:38.458
Was it?

00:13:39.078 --> 00:13:40.178
Most certainly not.

00:13:40.608 --> 00:13:45.928
The report was only a report, there was no law requiring it to be closed.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:53.238
A few months later, in May of 2006, a riot broke out after two prisoners attempted

00:13:53.238 --> 00:13:58.928
suicide, and then in June, three sadly succeeded in taking their own lives.

00:14:00.038 --> 00:14:04.378
Now, here’s where American domestic politics come into the picture.

00:14:05.358 --> 00:14:11.078
George W Bush, as we know, was President when America was attacked on 9/11.

00:14:11.878 --> 00:14:16.368
It was him who ordered the opening of Guantanamo Bay as a detention centre.

00:14:17.238 --> 00:14:21.798
And with all the patriotic rage in the country immediately after the

00:14:21.798 --> 00:14:26.408
attacks, there weren’t many politicians calling for its closure, or

00:14:26.588 --> 00:14:31.428
concerned about the legal differences between interrogation and torture.

00:14:32.138 --> 00:14:37.418
These were Bad Guys, with a capital B and a capital G, and

00:14:37.558 --> 00:14:40.558
they didn’t deserve to be treated like normal prisoners.

00:14:41.768 --> 00:14:49.458
But then, in November of 2008, a young lawyer and candidate for President, a man named

00:14:49.468 --> 00:14:57.388
Barack Obama, said that if he was elected he would close Guantanamo Bay within one year.

00:14:58.448 --> 00:15:06.288
Well Obama, it seems, was ahead of the curve, as in January of 2009 a former senior official

00:15:06.298 --> 00:15:11.998
from the Bush administration admitted publicly for the first time that the detainment

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:18.128
and interrogation of a Saudi national in Guantanamo met the legal definition of torture.

00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:23.773
And as you will know, Obama did win the election and was

00:15:23.773 --> 00:15:28.143
inaugurated as US President on January the 20th of 2009.

00:15:29.383 --> 00:15:32.583
What happened to his campaign promise, you might ask?

00:15:33.063 --> 00:15:37.493
Well, one of the very first acts of his presidency - just 2

00:15:37.523 --> 00:15:43.943
days later, on January 22nd - was to sign Executive Order 13492.

00:15:45.183 --> 00:15:50.453
He actually signed three executive orders: one to close Guantanamo Bay within a year,

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:56.413
another banning the CIA’s more brutal and dehumanising interrogation techniques,

00:15:56.813 --> 00:16:02.823
and a third promising a review of the law on detainees and detainee centre policy.

00:16:03.893 --> 00:16:07.473
Closing Guantanamo Bay within one year was quite the

00:16:07.493 --> 00:16:10.453
commitment from the young and optimistic president.

00:16:11.843 --> 00:16:16.293
But after being elected as the country’s first African-American president,

00:16:16.823 --> 00:16:21.813
Obama probably felt nothing was impossible and that he could achieve anything.

00:16:22.493 --> 00:16:26.503
His campaign slogan was, after all, Yes We Can.

00:16:27.493 --> 00:16:30.993
But did Guantanamo bay close within a year?

00:16:31.513 --> 00:16:32.103
Two years?

00:16:32.233 --> 00:16:32.643
Five?

00:16:32.693 --> 00:16:33.103
Ten?

00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:34.183
Not quite.

00:16:34.983 --> 00:16:41.083
Obama soon learnt that the hard realities of politics - particularly getting his legislation

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:46.083
through Congress - were much more difficult than making pledges on the campaign trail.

00:16:47.353 --> 00:16:51.553
His failure to live up to his campaign pledge was something used against

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:56.553
him over the next few years, and then, in a move that infuriated millions

00:16:56.563 --> 00:17:01.833
around the world, in March 2011 he signed another executive order.

00:17:02.893 --> 00:17:08.633
But this time it wasn’t to close Guantanamo down, or to ban interrogation techniques,

00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:15.783
it was to resume military trials and even for some detainees to be held indefinitely.

00:17:16.823 --> 00:17:22.363
Clearly, this was a complete abandonment from one of his main campaign promises.

00:17:23.513 --> 00:17:30.103
And to make things worse, in April of that year, WikiLeaks released US military files

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:37.363
showing that as many as 150 of the prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay had been innocent men.

00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:45.303
By this time, 604 inmates had been transferred out of the prison while 172 remained.

00:17:46.283 --> 00:17:52.163
And although Guantanamo certainly contained men who had done nothing wrong, it did contain its

00:17:52.173 --> 00:17:58.183
fair share of people who did meet Dick Cheney’s definition of being “the worst of a very bad lot.”

00:17:59.503 --> 00:18:05.023
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, for example, the man believed to be the mastermind of the 9/11

00:18:05.023 --> 00:18:12.273
attacks, was held at Guantanamo, and formally charged at a military tribunal in May 2012.

00:18:13.083 --> 00:18:16.953
He certainly wasn’t too keen on Americans, and is the

00:18:16.953 --> 00:18:21.193
example most often cited of “terrorists held at Guantanamo”.

00:18:22.253 --> 00:18:26.283
But with 10 years now having passed since the 9/11

00:18:26.283 --> 00:18:29.913
attacks, support for Guantanamo was starting to wane.

00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:39.003
Hoping to save face as his time in office wound to a close, in February of 2016 Obama came up with

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:46.643
another plan to close Guantanamo by transferring any detainees left to a prison on American soil.

00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:51.113
But like many policies during the Obama administration,

00:18:51.493 --> 00:18:54.543
it didn’t pass Congress and was unsuccessful.

00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:59.193
One of Obama’s main policy promises had been a failure.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.930
So who would follow him?

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.290
A human rights enthusiast?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.190
An ambassador of the law and international order?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.250
Well, not exactly.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.530
On January 20th, 2017, Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.700
And, as you might expect, he took quite a different stance to Obama.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:29.840
Whereas Obama promised to close it within a year, when Trump was on the campaign trail he promised

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:36.850
the American people he would, in his typically eloquent manner, “load it up with some bad dudes.”

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:43.090
When Trump arrived in the White House, there were only 50 prisoners left in Guantanamo.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.580
But just like predecessor, Trump wasted no time signing executive orders.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:58.290
On January the 30th of 2018, Trump signed one not to close it down, but to keep Guantanamo open.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:05.150
He did keep it open, but it certainly wasn’t “loaded up with” any guys - the number of

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:10.720
prisoners held in Guantanamo dwindled throughout his term, Trump had little impact on it.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:17.390
The current president, Obama’s former vice-president, Joe Biden, has said that

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.830
he wants to shut down Guantanamo Bay before his time in the White House ends.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.780
But how likely is this?

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.750
Unless the law changes, not likely at all because the transfer

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:34.260
of Guantanamo detainees to American soil is still illegal.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:40.010
Now, it’s been over 20 years since those first handcuffed,

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.470
orange jumpsuit wearing prisoners arrived in southern Cuba.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:50.770
Though there are now far fewer people held in Guantanamo, the treatment has not changed.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:56.350
As recently as 2017, a United Nations reporter concluded that the

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.900
evidence suggests torture was still ongoing at Guantanamo Bay.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:08.030
Human rights groups estimate that as many as 800 prisoners have passed through its doors

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:15.920
since it opened, with 732 being released or transferred, and at least 9 dying in prison.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:28.160
Of the 800, 219 were Afghanis, 140 were Saudis, 63 from Pakistan, 33 from Oman, 15 from

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:34.650
Britain [America’s closest ally in the War on Terror], 9 from France and 7 from Iraq.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.040
Many other countries from around the world have also had citizens

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.130
held indefinitely in Guantanamo - whether rightly or wrongly.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:50.630
And while it was home to many real terrorists, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, we also know that

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:57.610
there were at least 150 miscarriages of justice where innocent men were detained and tortured.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:04.230
Among those wrongly detained was Sami al-Haj, a Sudanese journalist captured while

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:09.240
working for Al Jazeera, and Mohammed el Gharani, the youngest prisoner held in

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:15.100
Guantanamo Bay, who was just 14 years old when he was arrested in Pakistan in 2001.

00:22:16.795 --> 00:22:21.470
So, while Guantanamo Bay is still most certainly open for

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:25.820
business, the question remains over what business that actually is.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.770
The business of information gathering?

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.910
The business of the protection of US citizens?

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.870
The business of torture?

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:39.050
And it leaves us with some important moral questions about what

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:43.850
lengths society should go in the name of protecting its citizens.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:51.560
The man whose face can be found on the $100 note, Benjamin Franklin, once wrote that

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:58.220
"it is better 100 guilty people should escape than one innocent Person should suffer".

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:05.730
The history of Guantanamo Bay certainly suggests that, in this respect at least, this small

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:13.100
enclave of Cuba is a long long way away from the ideals upon which the USA was founded.

00:23:15.736 --> 00:23:20.326
OK then, that’s it for today’s episode on Guantanamo Bay.

00:23:20.686 --> 00:23:25.626
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about Guantanamo Bay, or this was

00:23:25.626 --> 00:23:29.906
the first time you’d really heard anything about it, well I hope you learned something new.

00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:34.266
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:36.656
What do you think about Guantanamo Bay?

00:23:37.056 --> 00:23:39.696
How can you judge its success or failure?

00:23:40.176 --> 00:23:44.326
Where do you stand on the interrogation versus torture debate?

00:23:44.476 --> 00:23:46.816
Is it necessary in times of war?

00:23:47.276 --> 00:23:50.936
And do you agree with Benjamin Franklin, that it is better for a

00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:55.756
100 guilty people to go free, than one innocent person to suffer?

00:23:56.536 --> 00:24:00.086
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.879
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.799
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.999
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about something that

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.219
might seem boring and unimportant, merely a utility, a means of communication.

00:00:30.709 --> 00:00:33.069
But it is much more than that.

00:00:33.453 --> 00:00:37.339
It’s a cultural icon, an immediate sign of Britishness,

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:40.656
and one with a fascinating story behind it too.

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:47.180
Yes, it is the British phone box, and in this episode we are going to explore some

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.240
history behind the phone box, talk about how they worked in the past, how they

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.710
are adapting to the modern world, the interesting ways in which phone boxes are

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.850
still used, and how you can buy one for less than the cost of a cup of coffee.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.560
OK then, The British Phone Box.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.250
As regular listeners may know, I am from the UK, but I currently

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.220
live on the small island of Malta, which is in the Mediterranean.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.230
Malta is an unusual place for a plethora of reasons, but something that often

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.186
surprises visitors here are the clear signs of its British colonial history.

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:34.796
In Malta, English is an official language.

00:01:35.446 --> 00:01:38.996
The cars drive on the left side of the road, the

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:43.096
electrical plugs have three prongs, like they do in the UK.

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:49.936
You can go to the Lady Di pub or the City of London pub and order a pint of English beer.

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:54.266
If you so desire, you can even order a full English

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:58.016
breakfast, complete with baked beans and hash browns.

00:01:58.956 --> 00:02:04.506
And, if you wander through the streets of many of the country’s towns, you might be

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:11.216
surprised to see something that looks a little out of place: a British red phone box.

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:15.076
You may well be able to imagine one of these already.

00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:21.516
Imagine a box, 1 metre by 1 metre, and rising almost 3 metres up.

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:28.426
They are made of cast iron, and painted red, with a little dome on the top.

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:32.426
And of course inside, there is a telephone.

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:39.346
In Malta at least, the telephones don’t work any more; you can’t make a phone call from them.

00:02:40.606 --> 00:02:44.826
I’m not sure exactly when they stopped working, but they've been left

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:48.316
there because they are considered part of the country’s cultural heritage.

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:52.386
And it would appear from the amount of people who take pictures

00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:55.296
in them that they’re quite popular on social media too.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:03:00.736
You may well have seen these kinds of phone boxes yourself if you have visited

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:05.802
the UK, perhaps you have posed for a photo inside one on the streets of London.

00:03:06.712 --> 00:03:09.982
Now, you could be forgiven for thinking that they were

00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:13.522
all left standing merely for the benefit of tourists.

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:19.139
This isn’t the case, as we’ll talk about later on, but I want to first

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.402
give you some history about this quintessential part of British culture.

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:28.992
Firstly, the fact that these phone boxes are rather beautiful,

00:03:29.302 --> 00:03:33.852
they are aesthetically pleasing objects, this is no accident.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:38.312
The quintessential design that I described a minute ago

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:43.142
was the result of a nationwide competition back in 1924.

00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:50.752
Something called the Royal Fine Art Commission was hired to advise on the process, and the

00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:55.988
Royal Institute of British Architects and the Royal Academy of the Arts were also involved.

00:03:56.718 --> 00:04:03.148
This was no case of some middle manager saying “ok, that’ll do” and just getting

00:04:03.148 --> 00:04:09.418
lucky; some of the finest brains in British design and architecture were involved.

00:04:10.932 --> 00:04:15.272
The winner was the design that you see today, which was proposed

00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:20.122
by a man called Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, who would go on in fact to

00:04:20.152 --> 00:04:24.172
design many famous buildings  at Oxford and Cambridge universities.

00:04:25.412 --> 00:04:29.892
Interestingly enough, Scott’s initial plans did not call for

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:34.302
the outside of the phone box to be painted red, but silver.

00:04:35.822 --> 00:04:42.692
This proposal was rejected, as if they were red they would be easier to see from further away.

00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:49.372
After all, the phone boxes were a public utility; they were to be installed

00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:53.940
up and down the country, available to all, for a small fee of course.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.480
The design was chosen, and before long, they started to appear on the streets of Britain.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.560
First, there were only a few, 1,000 in 1925, then 8,000 by 1930, but

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.888
shortly afterwards the speed of installation really started to ramp up.

00:05:14.604 --> 00:05:21.570
35,000 by 1940, 73,000 by the 1980s, and by the end of the

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:28.620
century, in 1999, the number peaked at a reported 137,000.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.433
They were simply everywhere, on most street corners, on the

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.873
sides of remote country roads, and outside village pubs.

00:05:38.383 --> 00:05:44.013
Even though they were at their peak in the late 1990s, their very existence

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:49.753
and utility had started to be under threat as early as the 1980s, with

00:05:49.763 --> 00:05:54.123
the large increase in the number of people with landline phones at home.

00:05:55.263 --> 00:06:00.038
It sounds like a bit of an archaic thing to say nowadays, when the the number of people

00:06:00.038 --> 00:06:06.658
with a landline is decreasing, but having your own phone line at home meant that these

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:11.768
phone boxes were principally of use to people who either didn’t have a landline or who

00:06:11.768 --> 00:06:16.268
didn’t live locally, perhaps they were travelling through and needed to make a phone call.

00:06:17.548 --> 00:06:23.494
And of course, with the rise of mobile phones, the value of having these more than

00:06:23.494 --> 00:06:29.278
100,000 heavy boxes on the streets of Britain, well, it wasn’t always obvious.

00:06:30.418 --> 00:06:35.088
They have always been a target for criminals, as before they accepted

00:06:35.088 --> 00:06:39.218
card payments, clearly they would be full of cash, full of coins.

00:06:40.047 --> 00:06:45.887
And the fact that they were unattended meant that they were a constant target for petty criminals.

00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:51.237
With enough shaking and banging, ta-da, magic coins would come out.

00:06:52.297 --> 00:06:57.177
And even though they might not be full of cash in the same way as they were in the

00:06:57.177 --> 00:07:04.157
past, modern phone boxes remain the source of much illegal, or at least seedy activity.

00:07:05.607 --> 00:07:12.357
In an office I used to work in, in central London, the primary uses for the phone box right outside

00:07:12.357 --> 00:07:17.742
one of the meeting rooms seemed to be as a public toilet and a place to smoke crack cocaine.

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:23.612
Oh, and there were also plenty of little calling cards with pictures of semi-naked women.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:29.865
I’m not sure whether the phone itself actually worked, whether you could make a phone call with it,

00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:37.322
but the structure was certainly in use, albeit a different use from the one it was intended for.

00:07:38.448 --> 00:07:44.102
After all, 96% of British adults have a mobile phone, the days of being

00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:48.319
out and about and having no way to contact someone else are long gone.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:54.879
So, there is less reason for these phone boxes to exist, but not no reason.

00:07:55.869 --> 00:08:00.159
Remember, these phone boxes are considered a public good.

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:06.389
They are now administered by BT, British Telecom, which is a private company,

00:08:06.739 --> 00:08:12.413
but is regulated by the government and has strict guidelines it needs to follow.

00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:18.746
Specifically, with the case of the phone boxes, BT is required to

00:08:18.746 --> 00:08:23.416
maintain and keep them in operation if they meet certain criteria.

00:08:24.686 --> 00:08:28.716
For example, if 52 or more calls in a year are made

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:31.706
from a phone box, so at least one a week on average.

00:08:32.216 --> 00:08:35.806
Or, if the phone box is in an area without mobile phone reception.

00:08:37.016 --> 00:08:40.996
You might think that a country like the UK would be pretty well covered

00:08:41.256 --> 00:08:45.676
in this respect, but there are more black spots than you might imagine.

00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:51.786
I used to work in an area of London called Wimbledon, where the famous tennis tournament is

00:08:51.786 --> 00:08:57.996
held, and the phone boxes there were preserved because it is a mobile phone blackspot; there

00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:03.636
is either no or very little mobile phone signal in certain areas of this part of London.

00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:09.326
And there are other reasons that a phone box needs to be protected, for example

00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:13.126
if it has been used to make an important call to the emergency services.

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:18.286
Now, in terms of how often these phone boxes are used,

00:09:18.556 --> 00:09:22.276
and how they are used, you might find this surprising.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:29.856
OFCOM, the UK communications regulator, reports that there were 2.3 million

00:09:29.856 --> 00:09:35.896
calls made from phone boxes in 2022, that's more than 6,000 per day.

00:09:36.856 --> 00:09:41.896
Sure, this isn’t much when you compare it to the use of mobile phones, but they

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:47.316
are still providing a crucial service to thousands of people every single day.

00:09:48.636 --> 00:09:55.496
Of course, the content of these calls is private, but we do know which numbers are being called.

00:09:56.626 --> 00:10:02.396
The most common category is to the emergency services, police, ambulance or

00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:08.826
fire services, which accounts for 150,000 calls, or just under 7% of the total.

00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:16.966
Another 25,000 were to Childline, the free support service for children who

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:21.746
want advice on anything from day-to-day problems to reporting an abusive parent.

00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:28.596
And another 20,000 were to something called Samaritans, which is a free support

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:34.686
service for adults, and is a service that is on the frontline of suicide prevention.

00:10:35.726 --> 00:10:41.146
So, in total that’s almost 10% of all calls that are going to some kind of

00:10:41.176 --> 00:10:45.666
assistance service, whether that is a call to an ambulance as someone has had a

00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:51.166
heart attack while out walking, a child needing to report an abusive parent, or

00:10:51.426 --> 00:10:55.669
someone who is contemplating taking their own life and wants to talk to someone.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:03.126
What's abundantly clear is that these phone boxes, although they might seem unused and

00:11:03.456 --> 00:11:09.612
unloved, they often provide a safe haven, a sanctuary for someone to have an anonymous

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:15.252
conversation in, a conversation that they don’t want anyone at home to overhear or know about.

00:11:16.692 --> 00:11:22.492
There is still the remaining 90% of the 2.3 million phone calls that are a bit of a mystery.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:28.342
They aren’t going to emergency services or public numbers, they’re going to private individuals.

00:11:29.632 --> 00:11:33.983
There are stories of people, especially elderly people, who never

00:11:34.045 --> 00:11:38.493
got a landline installed at their house, and have always avoided a

00:11:38.493 --> 00:11:42.923
mobile phone, considering their local phone box to be “their phone”.

00:11:44.073 --> 00:11:49.023
Friends and relatives would call the phone box if they wanted to call these people, and

00:11:49.273 --> 00:11:53.993
friendly neighbours would answer the phone in the phone box if they heard it ringing, then

00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:59.173
knock on that person’s door and tell them their cousin Mike or Uncle Keith was on the line.

00:12:00.443 --> 00:12:06.753
These people are, naturally, in a minority, and one that is decreasing in size.

00:12:07.583 --> 00:12:12.863
Phone boxes are much more expensive and clearly less convenient than both

00:12:12.903 --> 00:12:18.123
landlines and mobile phones, so time’s winged chariot means that the number of

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:23.383
people who use phone boxes in this way is getting smaller and smaller every year.

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:30.493
And on a commercial level, BT, the company that operates these phone boxes,

00:12:30.873 --> 00:12:35.313
loses a huge amount of money by keeping the phone boxes in operation.

00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:42.233
There are now around 20,000 phone boxes in active service around the

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:47.283
country, and, even when you take into account the money spent on making

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:53.853
phone calls in these boxes, BT makes a net loss of £4.5 million a year.

00:12:54.563 --> 00:13:02.273
So it loses something like €5 million per year on phone boxes, or €250 per box.

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:10.393
Put simply, they cost a lot of money to maintain, and they bring in very little money in return.

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:15.853
It probably comes as no surprise there that BT is getting

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:19.663
creative with ways of getting rid of the boxes when it can.

00:13:20.963 --> 00:13:26.703
The most recent initiative is to try to get a community to buy a phone box for

00:13:26.703 --> 00:13:33.153
£1 and use it for some kind of community good, whether that’s a small community

00:13:33.153 --> 00:13:38.330
library, storage for a defibrillator - the machine you use to save someone who

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.460
is having a heart attack - or anything else that has a “community benefit”.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:51.070
According to the website, 7,200 phone boxes have been adopted so far, or sold so far.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:57.060
And even though BT might have only made €8,000 or so from the

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.900
sale, it will save something like €2 million a year in costs.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:08.810
But, much like with a litter of puppies at an abandoned dog shelter, waiting

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:14.220
hopefully to be chosen by prospective owners, the prettiest ones get taken first.

00:14:15.048 --> 00:14:21.919
And in the case of phone boxes in Britain, there are a lot of ugly mutts, unattractive designs.

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:27.559
The phone box that we’ve been talking about today, and the one you might

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:32.999
be imagining when you think of a British phone box, the 1920s “red phone

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:37.779
box” design by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, this is now in the minority.

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:47.659
Of the 20,000 or so remaining phone boxes, only 3,000 are in this traditional “red kiosk” style.

00:14:48.659 --> 00:14:55.809
The rest are pretty unattractive, utilitarian boxes that were introduced in the late 1980s.

00:14:56.919 --> 00:15:01.919
Indeed, while doing the research for this episode I discovered a fascinating

00:15:01.929 --> 00:15:06.569
subculture of people who are completely passionate about different kinds

00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:12.289
of British phone boxes, and the most recent model seems to be universally

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:18.909
panned, criticised for sacrificing style and design in the pursuit of utility.

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:26.992
In the 1980s, the red boxes were considered too heavy, too expensive to make and too impractical,

00:15:27.542 --> 00:15:33.512
so they were ditched in favour of a more “modern” design made out of aluminium and glass.

00:15:34.742 --> 00:15:41.302
And, in an ironic twist of fate, perhaps, these supposedly modern phone boxes have

00:15:41.302 --> 00:15:46.982
found that they are so ugly and undesirable that they have no place in the modern world.

00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:54.402
Nobody wants to turn an ugly glass box into a book exchange or an art gallery or a mini coffee shop.

00:15:55.462 --> 00:16:02.082
But plenty of people, 7,200 and counting, want to adopt the oldest and

00:16:02.082 --> 00:16:07.182
original model, the model where style and design were placed above utility.

00:16:07.962 --> 00:16:13.302
So I’ll end this episode by saying that I think there’s a lesson we can all learn from that.

00:16:15.837 --> 00:16:20.677
OK then, that is it for today's little exploration of The British Phone Box.

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:24.877
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that if you travel to Britain

00:16:25.227 --> 00:16:28.687
and one of your friends says, “hey, take a photo of me in front of

00:16:28.707 --> 00:16:33.027
that red phone box”, well, you can say “I know a story about that”.

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:36.887
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:41.557
Are there similar kinds of objects in your country, objects that once

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:45.517
had a public utility but this has changed significantly over time?

00:16:46.007 --> 00:16:49.297
What are they, and how has their use changed in the modern world?

00:16:49.928 --> 00:16:53.028
I would love to know,  so let’s get this discussion started.

00:16:53.498 --> 00:16:56.088

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.389
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.659
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.290
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about comic books.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.249
And more specifically, the great comic book bubble, when demand for

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.479
comic books went through the roof, only to come spectacularly crashing

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.950
down a few years later, almost completely destroying the industry.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.000
It’s a fascinating story, one of greed, fear, speculation, heroes and

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.769
villains, generational wealth, and about how when someone tells you that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.149
something is a surefire, certain investment, well this normally isn’t the case.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.660
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the comic book bubble.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.860
The legendary investor Warren Buffet once famously said “What

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.670
we learn from history is that people don't learn from history.”

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.320
We humans are not very good at learning from the past, and especially not very

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.899
good when we think that there is a once in a lifetime opportunity to become

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.809
fabulously wealthy while not lifting a finger, or at least, not doing very much.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.850
Whether we are talking about the tulip bubble in 17th century Holland, the South Sea

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.760
bubble less than a century later, or even just a few years ago, pictures of digital

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.289
rocks selling for millions of dollars, speculative bubbles seem to be a fact of life.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.300
And they all go a similar way.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.770
The price of something increases very quickly, so more people plough money into it, they buy more

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.800
of it, driving the price higher and higher, encouraging more people to invest, pushing the price

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:14.950
higher again, until finally the price stops rising, starts to fall, people get scared and start to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.389
panic sell, and the price comes crashing down, leaving a bunch of people nursing serious losses.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:32.152
And in the 1990s, 1993 to be precise, that “something” was comic books.

00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:36.882
Now, comic books have been around for quite some time,

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:41.332
with the modern “comic book” format emerging in the 1930s.

00:02:42.322 --> 00:02:47.392
They were, and still are, of course, an affordable source of entertainment.

00:02:48.512 --> 00:02:52.592
The initial target audience, in the US at least, was

00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:56.492
children and young adults, particularly young boys.

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:03.642
They were available at newstands, at a very reasonable price, and the idea was

00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:08.722
that they would be read by the child who bought it, perhaps passed around to

00:03:08.942 --> 00:03:14.672
brothers, sisters, and friends to enjoy, and then disposed of, thrown away.

00:03:15.782 --> 00:03:19.052
I mean, if you think of the magazines that you might have bought as

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:24.492
a child, perhaps you have kept some of them, but I imagine that many

00:03:24.492 --> 00:03:28.092
will have ended up in the bin a matter of days after reading them.

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:33.382
They were not built to last, and in fact were printed

00:03:33.402 --> 00:03:36.712
on some of the cheapest, flimsiest paper available.

00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:43.772
They tended to be feelgood stories of superheroes, characters who were relatively

00:03:44.012 --> 00:03:49.482
one dimensional - they were good, often patriotic people, they had to fight

00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:55.382
off baddies, but they always won, it was familiar and somewhat predictable.

00:03:56.572 --> 00:04:00.772
And this was the case for several decades, that was

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:05.562
until the 1980s, when the nature of comic books changed.

00:04:06.732 --> 00:04:12.582
Plotlines, the stories in the books, became more complicated and sophisticated.

00:04:13.872 --> 00:04:19.082
No longer were they mere children’s fare; the narrative was complex

00:04:19.322 --> 00:04:23.442
and nuanced, something that was more for adults than children, or at

00:04:23.442 --> 00:04:28.102
least something with enough layers that an adult reader could enjoy it.

00:04:29.392 --> 00:04:33.622
In terms of titles from this period, there were comics like Alan Moore's

00:04:33.702 --> 00:04:38.172
"Watchmen" and Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns", which both

00:04:38.192 --> 00:04:42.682
challenged the traditional boundaries of what was expected in a comic book.

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:48.272
As such, an older generation started to buy comic books,

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:51.722
there was demand from a different category of buyer.

00:04:53.082 --> 00:05:00.432
And this generation and this comic book buyer was rich, or at least richer than the kids

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:04.722
that were otherwise buying comics with their pocket money or earnings from their paper round.

00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:10.612
I mean, they were adults, so almost by default had more money than kids.

00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:16.405
What’s more, the way in which comic books were sold changed.

00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:22.648
Previously, they had almost exclusively been sold at newsstands,

00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:27.425
alongside newspapers, sports magazines, cigarettes, you name it.

00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:32.915
As demand for comic books increased, there was a growth in

00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:37.795
dedicated comic book shops, places that only sold comic books.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:45.295
In 1989 there were under a thousand comic book shops in the United States, but

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:53.389
by 1993, just four years later, this number would balloon to around 10,000.

00:05:54.456 --> 00:05:59.515
There were a few reasons for this, both on the supply and the demand side.

00:06:00.825 --> 00:06:05.885
On the supply side, the comic book publishers had previously kept quite

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:10.185
tight control on who was allowed to sell comic books: the newsstands.

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:15.695
The publishers also had an agreement with the newsstand owners that they

00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:21.965
would take back any unsold comic books, so if a newsstand didn’t sell all of

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:25.885
a particular edition of a comic book, it could be returned to the publisher.

00:06:27.225 --> 00:06:31.795
This was clearly a good deal for the newsstands, but it

00:06:31.795 --> 00:06:35.595
was a logistical nightmare for the comic book publishers.

00:06:36.285 --> 00:06:40.005
They had to deal with the operational side of returned comic books,

00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:44.535
plus the cost of refunding the newsstands for their unsold copies.

00:06:45.625 --> 00:06:52.775
But as the publishers saw an increasing appetite for older and rarer editions of comic

00:06:52.775 --> 00:07:00.055
books, they came up with an idea: start selling them directly to the comic book shops.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:07.580
However this time, there would be no guarantee that they could be returned if they weren’t sold.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.560
This was clearly a good deal for the publishers, and it turned out

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.940
to be also a good deal, initially at least, for the comic book shops.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.170
The comic book shops would keep everything in stock, allowing dedicated fans to sift

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.390
through back editions and find the older ones that they wanted to add to their collection.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.300
And the business of running a comic book shop seemed like it was foolproof.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.590
All you needed to do was have a small space, you could guarantee that

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.410
it would attract highly dedicated customers, and unlike a fruit and

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.110
vegetable shop, your product would never go off, it would never go bad.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.110
In fact, the opposite would happen.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.390
The price of your inventory could go up, and you would have fans

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:04.910
knocking at your door trying to buy your oldest and rarest items.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:11.380
Editions that might have been sold for a dollar when they were first published might be sold

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:19.670
for $10 or $20 a few months later, a 10 or 20 times increase in price in a matter of months.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.200
And from the comic book buyer side, it seemed like easy money.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:34.650
After all, the barrier to entry was low, just the price of a comic book, and it seemed that all

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:41.340
you needed to do was buy and wait for a few months to increase your money by 10 times or more.

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:45.975
As with all bubbles, it started slowly.

00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:50.255
But as people started to see that this seemed to be a

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:55.195
surefire way of making money, more and more people piled in.

00:08:56.565 --> 00:09:01.755
First it was the comic book fans, the people who really wanted to read the comic books.

00:09:03.135 --> 00:09:08.645
But instead of buying one copy to read, they might buy one copy to read,

00:09:08.975 --> 00:09:14.405
then another 5 or 10 copies to keep in pristine condition, anticipating

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:18.735
being able to sell them a few months down the line for a healthy profit.

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:27.035
And then came the people who were not comic book fans, but who smelled a money-making opportunity.

00:09:27.885 --> 00:09:33.885
A new type of buyer started skulking around comic book shops, often buying up

00:09:33.975 --> 00:09:38.645
dozens of editions in the hope that one of them would turn out to be a winner.

00:09:40.085 --> 00:09:44.635
Seeing this growing trend, the publishers did all they could

00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:49.315
to fan the flames of the bubble, and sell more comic books.

00:09:50.675 --> 00:09:54.815
The problem was that they couldn’t simply print more of the same comic

00:09:54.815 --> 00:10:01.425
books, as the main driver behind the price rises was rarity and scarcity.

00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:07.065
If 100,000 other people had the same comic book as you,

00:10:07.635 --> 00:10:10.845
well it really wasn’t that rare or valuable at all.

00:10:11.925 --> 00:10:19.385
So, the comic book publishers introduced several tricks to encourage people to buy more comic books.

00:10:20.655 --> 00:10:25.385
Firstly, they introduced crossover stories, where the narrative

00:10:25.405 --> 00:10:29.935
of one story would span multiple different editions and titles.

00:10:31.285 --> 00:10:36.585
Whereas previously a kid could have bought a single comic book for less than

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:41.895
a dollar and followed the story of a superhero from the start to a satisfying

00:10:41.895 --> 00:10:48.945
conclusion, now they had to continue buying multiple copies, often even of different

00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:54.205
comic books, over a period of several months in order to read the full story.

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:59.535
This got more money out of the people who were interested merely in the

00:10:59.535 --> 00:11:05.205
story, and it also forced the collectors to buy a copy of each part of the

00:11:05.205 --> 00:11:10.235
story, because nobody would be interested in buying an incomplete collection.

00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:17.085
Secondly, they introduced scarcity and rarity in the same comic

00:11:17.085 --> 00:11:21.335
book by selling limited edition versions with different covers.

00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:29.225
Inside, the story would be exactly the same, but there would be a limited number of different

00:11:29.255 --> 00:11:36.105
covers: holographic covers, glow in the dark covers, foil covers, die-cut covers, and so on.

00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:42.785
So a comic book that might have been printed, let's say 500,000

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:48.792
times, with 500,000 identical versions, might be printed with  10

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:53.852
different covers, making each one rarer and therefore more valuable.

00:11:55.022 --> 00:11:59.322
There were other tricks like printing an edition that came in a sealed plastic

00:11:59.322 --> 00:12:05.702
envelope, so the publishers knew that if a fan wanted to buy it to read and as

00:12:05.702 --> 00:12:10.672
an investment, they would have to buy two copies: one to open and read, and the

00:12:10.682 --> 00:12:15.102
other to leave in its sealed envelope so that it remained in pristine condition.

00:12:16.422 --> 00:12:22.432
They also simply printed more different comic books, introducing new characters and stories.

00:12:23.582 --> 00:12:31.552
In 1985, the publisher Marvel released 40 titles a month, each costing around 60 cents a copy.

00:12:32.302 --> 00:12:42.222
But by 1993, it was releasing 140 a month, with most costing $1.25 or more, so it was releasing 3

00:12:42.222 --> 00:12:48.692
and a half times as many titles, with each title costing double what it had been a decade before.

00:12:50.172 --> 00:12:56.632
As you might imagine, there was a resulting dip in quality, as the focus was on producing as many

00:12:56.642 --> 00:13:02.452
different comic books as possible, rather than focussing on a few core characters and storylines.

00:13:03.792 --> 00:13:08.632
But, from a collector’s perspective, in the short term, it worked.

00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:13.692
Nobody knew which comic book or character would become popular in

00:13:13.692 --> 00:13:18.172
the years to come, so speculators would buy up a bunch of different

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:21.272
ones in the hope that there would be gold hidden somewhere in there.

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:27.572
And there were also big, flashy events, the most famous of which came

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:32.909
at the very height of the bubble between the end of 1992 and mid-1993.

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:41.292
DC comics, one of the oldest and largest comic book publishers, made waves when it announced

00:13:41.382 --> 00:13:48.662
in late 1992 that it would be releasing a crossover story on The Death of Superman.

00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:50.822
What, people said?

00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:57.622
Superman can’t die, that would be like killing off, well there was no parallel.

00:13:58.062 --> 00:14:02.902
Superman was Superman, he was an American cultural icon.

00:14:03.032 --> 00:14:04.342
He couldn’t die!

00:14:05.402 --> 00:14:10.427
It was all over the news, and fans queued up to get their hands on the first

00:14:10.427 --> 00:14:16.782
copy of the story, which sold 6 million copies, and despite how many were

00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:22.882
printed, second-hand copies were changing hands for $30 just a few months later.

00:14:23.852 --> 00:14:28.342
It was long and drawn out, the entire story of the Death of Superman

00:14:28.652 --> 00:14:33.852
taking place over 15 different editions in 6 different comic books.

00:14:34.312 --> 00:14:41.530
It took almost a year to unfold, from December 1992 through to October of 1993.

00:14:42.672 --> 00:14:47.902
And in the end, Superman does die, but he comes back

00:14:47.902 --> 00:14:51.972
to life again, so it was something of an anticlimax.

00:14:52.942 --> 00:14:55.822
The entire series got mixed reviews.

00:14:56.402 --> 00:15:02.442
Some said it was a nuanced and well-developed story while others, especially the

00:15:02.442 --> 00:15:08.792
more dedicated comic book fans, saw it as a gimmick, merely a way of getting people

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:12.622
to spend a lot more money on comic books than they would have otherwise done.

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:19.832
It did sell a lot of comic books, but it was the beginning of the end for the comic book bubble.

00:15:21.032 --> 00:15:26.212
And as with all bubbles, as soon as there is a whiff, just the

00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:31.622
slightest sense, that the tide is turning, things move quickly.

00:15:32.642 --> 00:15:39.132
Sales started to slow, both of first editions and second-hand editions.

00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:44.682
This meant that comic book shops had more inventory, more

00:15:44.822 --> 00:15:48.812
copies to sell, meaning that the resale price went down.

00:15:49.882 --> 00:15:54.562
As the price went down, collectors started to panic sell, hoping

00:15:54.562 --> 00:15:58.232
to offload their comic books before the price dropped further.

00:15:59.482 --> 00:16:04.792
As panic spread, more comic books flooded the market, and nobody

00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:08.782
wanted to buy an “asset” that was devaluing in front of their eyes.

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:13.862
Comic book shops were forced to close down, as they were

00:16:13.862 --> 00:16:17.972
stuck with storerooms full of books that nobody wanted to buy.

00:16:18.972 --> 00:16:25.272
Thousands of people, almost 10,000 people to be precise, had opened up comic book shops

00:16:25.572 --> 00:16:32.422
up and down the country, but now with the market dried up, and no recourse to send

00:16:32.422 --> 00:16:36.912
their unsold books back to the publishers, they were forced to go out of business.

00:16:38.042 --> 00:16:42.212
Of the 10,000 or so comic book shops that existed in the United States

00:16:42.382 --> 00:16:50.184
in 1993, around 90% were forced to close down, as sales dropped by 75%.

00:16:51.687 --> 00:16:55.562
Earlier I referred to comic books as an “asset”.

00:16:56.742 --> 00:17:00.152
If you look up the dictionary definition of “asset”, you’ll

00:17:00.152 --> 00:17:03.932
find something like “a useful or valuable thing or person.”

00:17:05.302 --> 00:17:09.022
Most people realised that comic books might be fun to

00:17:09.022 --> 00:17:13.542
read, but most of them are neither useful nor valuable.

00:17:14.472 --> 00:17:19.432
Collectors who had filled their garages with boxes of unopened comic books in the hope

00:17:19.492 --> 00:17:24.372
that this would turn into their children’s college fund found that the comic books were

00:17:24.372 --> 00:17:30.022
not made of gold; in most cases they were barely worth the paper they were printed on.

00:17:30.952 --> 00:17:36.502
Now, of course this was sad news for people who had spent a lot of money on comic books,

00:17:37.032 --> 00:17:42.222
but this was a very isolated bubble when you compare it to things like the financial

00:17:42.222 --> 00:17:48.332
crash of 2007, or even events like the more recent cryptocurrency “bubble”, where

00:17:48.392 --> 00:17:53.192
tens of millions of people put large amounts of money into obscure cryptocurrencies

00:17:53.392 --> 00:17:57.752
in the hope of striking it big, only to find them worthless several months later.

00:17:59.032 --> 00:18:02.422
So, where does this leave the comic book industry today?

00:18:03.192 --> 00:18:07.872
Well, a lot of the junk that was published during the bubble is pretty

00:18:07.872 --> 00:18:13.332
worthless, but the rarest comic books still command sizable sums.

00:18:14.362 --> 00:18:24.795
In 2022, a single copy of Superman 1 from 1939 was sold for a staggering $5.3 million.

00:18:25.302 --> 00:18:31.242
It is in mint condition, the only known copy in the world to still be in pristine condition.

00:18:32.482 --> 00:18:37.832
It is somewhat ironic, perhaps, that the tens of thousands of children who

00:18:37.892 --> 00:18:44.392
bought it back in 1939, and paid 10 cents for their copy, would have read

00:18:44.392 --> 00:18:49.162
it cover to cover, enjoying every detail of the story and the artwork.

00:18:50.512 --> 00:18:55.186
83 years later, the person who paid $5.3 million,

00:18:55.482 --> 00:18:59.152
in all probability won’t ever even touch the pages.

00:19:01.482 --> 00:19:05.932
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Great Comic Book Bubble.

00:19:06.392 --> 00:19:09.632
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:10.202 --> 00:19:13.022
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:13.352 --> 00:19:19.512
If you are a comic book fan, past or present, what are your thoughts or memories on this period?

00:19:19.772 --> 00:19:24.342
Do you have boxes of comic books stashed away in your garage or attic, and

00:19:24.532 --> 00:19:28.232
do you still hold some hope that there is gold hidden in there somewhere?

00:19:28.642 --> 00:19:33.692
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started: you can head right into our community

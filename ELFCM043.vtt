Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:10.677
English.

00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:16.977
The show where you can listen to weird and wonderful stories and learn fascinating things about the

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:20.607
world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:22.587
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:23.727 --> 00:00:31.497
Today we are going to be talking about tulip mania, the tulip bubble, when flowers cost more than

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:32.217
houses.

00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:38.367
If you have never heard of the tulip bubble before, well you are in for a treat.

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:45.402
And if you had heard about it but can't quite remember much, well, don't worry.

00:00:45.822 --> 00:00:52.752
In today's podcast, we are going to talk about how it got to the stage that one single bulb of a

00:00:52.752 --> 00:01:00.342
tulip was reportedly worth the same as a large townhouse on Amsterdam's grand canal.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:08.042
Before we get right into that, though, let me just remind those of you listening to this podcast on

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:14.382
whatever podcast app you might be listening to it on that you can get a copy of the transcript and

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:19.932
key vocabulary for the podcast over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.220
If you are looking for a quicker, more interesting way to improve your English, then having the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.420
transcript and key vocabulary in front of you is very helpful.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.830
Not only will it help you follow along with the podcast, but you'll also be able to learn new words

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.082
and phrases far more quickly than you would do just by listening alone.

00:01:43.682 --> 00:01:45.332
So go and check that out.

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.602
It's at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:50.113 --> 00:01:53.503
Right then tulip mania or the tulip bubble.

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:57.743
Let's just start with some quick definitions.

00:01:59.123 --> 00:02:04.698
A tulip, for those of you who aren't aware, is a brightly coloured flower.

00:02:05.538 --> 00:02:09.198
They are normally red, pink, yellow or white.

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:11.988
You'd definitely recognise one if you saw it.

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:20.934
Nowadays, they are relatively common and you can find them pretty inexpensively, they are generally

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:21.684
quite cheap.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.536
However, in the 1600s in Holland, they were anything but.

00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:38.624
From their introduction to Europe in the late 16th century, the price of a tulip bulb, that part of

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:47.531
the plant from which the flower grows, the price of tulip bulbs increased dramatically until

00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:54.185
February, 1637, where there was a spectacular collapse in the price.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:04.694
It is said that at the height of tulip mania, the price of a single bulb, one single tulip bulb

00:03:05.294 --> 00:03:08.624
could be up to 5,200 guilders.

00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:16.124
Now, the guilder was the currency in Holland at the time, and I would imagine that me just saying

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:19.927
5,200 guilders doesn't mean very much to you.

00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:21.007
It's not very helpful.

00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:23.038
So let's put it in context.

00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:30.748
That is about 20 times the annual salary of a skilled worker, such as a carpenter.

00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:36.468
It's five times what Rembrandt charged for a painting.

00:03:37.128 --> 00:03:41.778
And in today's equivalent, it's probably about a million dollars.

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:51.264
And that's all for a single bulb of a plant which you can probably buy now for well under a dollar.

00:03:52.839 --> 00:04:01.762
So I guess the question that you might have would be why and how did they become so expensive?

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:09.172
Yes, it's quite a beautiful flower, but at the end of the day, it's just a flower.

00:04:10.102 --> 00:04:12.772
Why would anyone pay so much for one?

00:04:14.446 --> 00:04:21.785
Well, yes, it's obviously a huge amount of money, but on one level it's not completely, completely

00:04:21.785 --> 00:04:22.265
mad.

00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:29.411
Firstly, the price of anything is made up of a few factors.

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:38.301
For example, how much it costs to produce, how many of them exist, and how many people want one.

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:47.062
Obviously if something is very rare, lots of people want it, well, it's likely to have a high price.

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:56.458
And if the supply of something is limited, if there aren't that many of them in existence, then the

00:04:56.458 --> 00:05:01.018
more that are sold, the fewer there are for people to buy.

00:05:01.288 --> 00:05:07.303
And so the more people are willing to pay to buy one, therefore, the fewer there are, and you can

00:05:07.303 --> 00:05:09.283
see that the circle continues.

00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:17.631
If people see that the price of something is rising and they think that they can make a quick buck,

00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:24.471
they can make some quick money by buying something and then selling it to someone for more, even if

00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:30.951
they have no need for it, well, that's all well and good for a period of time.

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:39.809
And tulips in the 1600s in Holland, they ticked a lot of the boxes for something that should be

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:40.469
expensive.

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:47.309
They were in pretty short supply and they were in very high demand.

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:55.353
They were coveted, they were highly desired by the middle and upper classes, for reasons that we'll

00:05:55.353 --> 00:05:56.493
talk about in a bit.

00:05:57.738 --> 00:06:04.587
And the more that they were desired, the more people wanted them, the more the price went up and up

00:06:04.587 --> 00:06:05.067
and up.

00:06:06.018 --> 00:06:10.668
And so more people tried to jump in on the game.

00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:19.818
They wanted to join the craze and buy tulips in anticipation of being able to sell them for more

00:06:20.448 --> 00:06:21.018
later on.

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.477
So to circle back a minute.

00:06:24.687 --> 00:06:31.737
When I said it's not completely mad to pay a huge amount of money for something that we might now

00:06:31.737 --> 00:06:38.882
think is not worth a huge amount of money, it's not mad at all for me to buy a tulip bulb for

00:06:38.882 --> 00:06:44.852
$500,000 if I know that I can sell it to you for $600,000.

00:06:46.097 --> 00:06:51.002
But this only works if the price of something continues to rise.

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:59.042
And as everyone knows, or everyone should know, there is no such thing as a guarantee that the price

00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:01.562
of something will continue to rise.

00:07:02.864 --> 00:07:09.986
Anyone who tells you differently is either not a very good student of history or trying to trick you

00:07:09.986 --> 00:07:13.226
into doing something that you probably shouldn't do.

00:07:14.328 --> 00:07:16.192
But let's get back to tulips.

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:23.152
Why was it that tulip bulbs, of all possible things, became so expensive?

00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:32.968
Well, the tulip was introduced to Holland in the late 16th century, having been introduced to Europe

00:07:32.998 --> 00:07:34.888
by the Ottoman empire.

00:07:36.345 --> 00:07:42.760
Tulips were different to all the other flowers that existed in Europe at the time.

00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:51.689
They were bright and colourful, seemed very exotic, and they quickly became a hit with rich

00:07:51.689 --> 00:07:58.177
merchants who were flush with cash, who had made lots of money through trade.

00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:05.964
Holland was, at this time, one of the richest countries in the world, after gaining independence

00:08:05.994 --> 00:08:06.774
from Spain.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.520
It had become a centre of world trade.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:19.664
Huge fortunes were made, many merchants and their investors, their backers, many became

00:08:19.664 --> 00:08:27.327
fantastically rich and with all this money, they wanted a way to show off their wealth, to flaunt

00:08:27.327 --> 00:08:27.927
their wealth.

00:08:29.346 --> 00:08:38.660
Tulips, as a new and exotic flower, became very desirable with these rich merchants.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:48.720
And some particularly rare tulips became incredibly sought after, incredibly wanted by these

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.260
merchants.

00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:58.655
Specifically, there was one called a broken tulip, which produced flowers with stripes on it.

00:08:59.574 --> 00:09:07.164
This was considered the most beautiful of all the tulips, and of course, it came with the largest

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:07.974
price tag.

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:14.296
Now, you may not know much about how tulips actually grow.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.670
I didn't know much about it either, and I'm not an avid gardener, so I'll try to keep this simple.

00:09:22.147 --> 00:09:26.656
Tulips can grow both from bulbs, and from seeds.

00:09:27.496 --> 00:09:33.256
But a tulip bulb is only formed after 7 to 12 years.

00:09:34.396 --> 00:09:44.356
When the bulb turns into a flower, the bulb disappears, but another kind of bulb is formed as well

00:09:44.356 --> 00:09:50.396
as several other things called buds, which can then be turned into bulbs.

00:09:51.494 --> 00:10:00.855
So long story short - tulip bulbs take a long time to appear, but once you have one, you can turn

00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:02.925
that into several more bulbs.

00:10:03.941 --> 00:10:11.212
And tulips only bloom, they only turn into flowers, twice a year, in May and September.

00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:20.162
Outside of that period, they can be moved around, they can be transported, but they are pretty

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:20.792
fragile.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:28.140
The reason I'm talking here about how tulips grow is twofold: it's for two reasons.

00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:36.804
Firstly, lots of people thought that they could basically buy one tulip bulb and turn it into

00:10:36.804 --> 00:10:41.454
multiple bulbs, which they could then sell on to other people.

00:10:42.515 --> 00:10:49.732
This sounds like good advice in practice - it sounds like a good investment - but so long as the

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:50.872
price doesn't go down.

00:10:52.332 --> 00:11:01.362
Secondly, the fact that tulip bulbs only flower, they only turn into flowers, twice a year meant

00:11:01.362 --> 00:11:10.320
that if you wanted to buy a tulip outside of that season, then what you had to do was sign a

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:17.400
contract with someone who had a tulip bulb to buy a tulip at a certain point in the future.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:27.243
So to give you an example, if I had a tulip bulb that was going to flower in September, let's see, I

00:11:27.243 --> 00:11:35.343
could say to you that I will sell you the flower for X thousand dollars or X hundred dollars in four

00:11:35.343 --> 00:11:35.973
months' time.

00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:45.676
It's basically what we know now as a futures contract and these tulip futures were some of the

00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:51.256
earliest forms of these now very popular financial instruments.

00:11:52.248 --> 00:12:03.267
So what happened was that prices rose and rose, and in around 1634 professional traders entered the

00:12:03.267 --> 00:12:03.957
tulip market.

00:12:04.587 --> 00:12:12.591
People were buying and selling these tulip bulb contracts without the intention of ever actually

00:12:12.591 --> 00:12:14.991
taking ownership of the tulips.

00:12:17.027 --> 00:12:24.497
All they wanted to do was to buy a contract then to sell it on to someone else for more money.

00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:32.576
And for lots of people, for a few years, they managed to do this quite successfully.

00:12:33.723 --> 00:12:37.593
When the going is good, as they say, everyone makes money.

00:12:38.648 --> 00:12:46.962
But there is this idea of the greater fool theory that the price of something is not determined by

00:12:46.992 --> 00:12:53.472
its intrinsic value, but by how much someone else is willing to pay for it.

00:12:54.152 --> 00:13:01.320
It doesn't matter how much you pay for something, as long as you can find someone who is prepared to

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.390
pay more than you paid for it.

00:13:04.627 --> 00:13:07.957
However, the good times couldn't go on forever.

00:13:09.325 --> 00:13:19.362
Tulip mania reached its peak in the winter of 1636 to 1637 when some bulbs were reportedly changing

00:13:19.362 --> 00:13:23.823
hands, they were being bought and sold, 10 times in a day.

00:13:25.473 --> 00:13:33.113
And when we say changing hands here, remember we're not talking about physical tulips.

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:38.509
This wasn't a load of people with gardening gloves, buying and selling plants.

00:13:39.469 --> 00:13:44.405
It was people with pieces of paper, contracts to buy and sell tulips.

00:13:45.305 --> 00:13:50.255
They rarely took physical possession of the actual tulip bulbs.

00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:57.855
But didn't anyone say, Hey, this seems a little weird, why are we paying so much money for this?'

00:13:59.175 --> 00:14:06.343
Well, when everyone seems to be making money and there is this feeling that the price can't do

00:14:06.343 --> 00:14:10.701
anything but increase, people behave in strange ways.

00:14:11.841 --> 00:14:15.861
All sense of rationality disappears.

00:14:15.861 --> 00:14:17.151
It goes out the window.

00:14:18.522 --> 00:14:27.710
But as with any bubble, there is one point where the price is just too high and something changes in

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.862
the market to scare people and send the price crashing down.

00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:39.122
In Holland that point came in the year 1637.

00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:49.659
Traders had been borrowing money in order to make tulip orders, promising to pay greater and greater

00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:55.289
sums in order to secure the most desirable tulip bulbs.

00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:06.480
And towards the end of 1636 people had started to realise that tulips weren't actually that

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.680
difficult to grow.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.100
But the price continued to rise and rise.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:23.434
Then one morning in February, 1637 a tulip didn't sell for the first time at an auction and the

00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:24.874
market panicked.

00:15:25.624 --> 00:15:28.594
People thought, 'hang on, this is strange.

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:34.904
The price had been going up and up and up, and now if no one's buying this particular tulip,

00:15:35.195 --> 00:15:36.425
something must be wrong'.

00:15:37.017 --> 00:15:43.693
So the price fell, and it fell some more and more and more and continued to fall sharply.

00:15:43.843 --> 00:15:45.253
It nose dived.

00:15:47.416 --> 00:15:54.808
As there were so many people reportedly caught up in tulip mania, it was thought for a long time

00:15:55.108 --> 00:16:00.028
that there was a huge effect, a huge impact, on Dutch society.

00:16:01.088 --> 00:16:09.201
Fortunes were lost, people went bankrupt, they lost all of their money, and people would throw

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:13.311
themselves into canals in order to escape their debts.

00:16:14.153 --> 00:16:17.003
That was the traditional view of what happened.

00:16:18.239 --> 00:16:26.287
However, there has been quite a lot of recent evidence that suggests that this conventional view of

00:16:26.287 --> 00:16:35.467
tulip mania is actually quite exaggerated, and it makes for a more interesting story than is really

00:16:35.467 --> 00:16:35.947
true.

00:16:36.798 --> 00:16:44.428
The most famous account of tulip mania, of the tulip bubble, was in a book written by a Scottish

00:16:44.428 --> 00:16:50.198
author called Charles Mackay in 1841, 200 years later.

00:16:51.198 --> 00:16:53.052
Mackay never went to Holland.

00:16:53.612 --> 00:17:01.058
He never consulted any of the primary sources, and it's now thought that he exaggerated it greatly.

00:17:02.092 --> 00:17:05.872
Yes, the price of tulip bulbs did skyrocket.

00:17:06.235 --> 00:17:09.744
However, it wasn't quite the scenario that he described.

00:17:10.015 --> 00:17:17.210
It wasn't quite this situation that every man and his dog was speculating on the price of tulips.

00:17:18.394 --> 00:17:26.554
According to recent historians, the tulip bubble mainly affected the merchant class and the very

00:17:26.554 --> 00:17:27.064
wealthy.

00:17:28.264 --> 00:17:35.329
Yes, there may have been people who lost very large amounts of money, but they were the kinds of

00:17:35.329 --> 00:17:39.529
people who could actually afford to lose large amounts of money.

00:17:40.588 --> 00:17:43.168
It doesn't really make it any less silly.

00:17:43.498 --> 00:17:50.878
However, it wasn't quite the traditional view that the mania had gripped the entire country and

00:17:50.878 --> 00:17:52.438
destroyed the Dutch economy.

00:17:54.346 --> 00:18:01.619
Mackay, the author of the 'original', in inverted commas, original book about tulip mania also

00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:09.719
claimed that the rise of the plague, the black death, was a reason that people were willing to risk

00:18:09.719 --> 00:18:12.959
everything in order to make a fortune on tulips.

00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:18.995
If you might die tomorrow, well you may as well take a huge risk and try and make some money.

00:18:20.275 --> 00:18:24.295
But most modern historians also dispute this claim.

00:18:25.085 --> 00:18:33.065
They say that the only effect the plague may have had is that people had a bit more money because

00:18:33.065 --> 00:18:38.345
they had inherited money from relatives who might have died in the plague.

00:18:39.139 --> 00:18:42.785
So yes, Mackay exaggerated it quite a bit.

00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:50.059
In any case though, it remains the classic example of a speculative bubble.

00:18:51.989 --> 00:18:54.899
But have we learned our lessons from tulip mania?

00:18:55.679 --> 00:18:59.129
Well, modern history would suggest not really.

00:19:00.479 --> 00:19:07.979
In the past 500 years since tulip mania, we have seen multiple new bubbles, from the South Sea

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:14.332
Bubble in the 18th Century in the UK, the Mississippi Bubble at a similar time in France.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:21.490
Then more recently, we had the Dot Com bubble with internet companies at the end of the 20th

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:29.907
century, and although many would debate this I'm sure, the meteoric rise and fall of Bitcoin and

00:19:30.177 --> 00:19:35.757
other cryptocurrencies over the past few years shows a lot of bubble characteristics.

00:19:37.267 --> 00:19:44.157
In all of these cases, there are obviously people who managed to make huge fortunes, just vast

00:19:44.157 --> 00:19:45.027
amounts of money.

00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:55.434
But there are, of course, those who lost fortunes trying to ride the wave, blinded by this view that

00:19:55.434 --> 00:19:57.204
the price could only increase.

00:19:58.524 --> 00:20:01.974
And all is well and good while the price keeps on rising.

00:20:02.813 --> 00:20:11.281
But if you are one of the people who finds yourself having promised to pay a six figure sum for a

00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:19.869
flower, and then you suddenly find that nobody is even prepared to pay you 1/10th for exactly the

00:20:19.869 --> 00:20:24.099
same thing, well, that's not the situation you want to be in.

00:20:25.609 --> 00:20:32.916
Luckily for the Dutch in the 17th Century, the people who found themselves in that situation seemed

00:20:32.946 --> 00:20:37.086
to be the already wealthy, who could afford to lose large amounts of money.

00:20:39.143 --> 00:20:44.753
So how can you avoid losing vast amounts of money in a speculative bubble?

00:20:45.623 --> 00:20:48.083
Well, I think we both know the answer to that.

00:20:48.563 --> 00:20:50.993
You avoid joining the race in the first place.

00:20:54.118 --> 00:20:57.568
Okay then that is it for today's episode.

00:20:58.078 --> 00:21:00.958
I guess the moral of the story is pretty easy.

00:21:01.438 --> 00:21:07.648
If you ever hear about anything that the price can only go up well, you know, to take that with a

00:21:07.648 --> 00:21:09.508
very large pinch of salt.

00:21:10.618 --> 00:21:13.438
As always, I'd love to know what you thought of the show.

00:21:14.012 --> 00:21:20.332
Have there ever been any speculative bubbles in your country about things that the rest of the world

00:21:20.542 --> 00:21:21.562
might not be aware of?

00:21:22.162 --> 00:21:26.842
What do you think of the people who paid six figure sums for tulip bulbs?

00:21:27.468 --> 00:21:28.308
I'd love to know.

00:21:28.668 --> 00:21:32.258

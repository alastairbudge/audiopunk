Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.835
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:19.885
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:24.555
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Chicken.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:28.395
And more specifically, the economics of chicken.

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:34.245
How has a small bird from the jungles of Southeast Asia gone on to be the most

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:39.015
popular source of protein in the world, and how have farmers managed to reduce the

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:44.675
price for a chicken to such an extent that, pound for pound, chickens are often

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:49.155
more than 5 times cheaper now than they were at the start of the 20th century.

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:55.405
Now, I guess this episode should have some kind of animal-cruelty warning, as we will be

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:59.745
talking about the business of how chickens are raised and killed for human consumption.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:04.255
So, if that isn’t your cup of tea, then I would recommend pausing now.

00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:08.443
OK then, the economics of chicken.

00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:16.383
If you stopped 100 people in the street and asked them, “Excuse me, if you could be reincarnated

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:21.783
as any animal, what would it be?”, I wonder what sorts of animals you’d hear the most.

00:01:22.703 --> 00:01:26.823
I say “I wonder” because we did try to find some kind of

00:01:27.043 --> 00:01:31.723
semi-legitimate survey on this, but it seems that none has been done.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:40.263
If one had been done, I imagine you might find dogs, cats, perhaps lions, or eagles up there.

00:01:41.223 --> 00:01:45.383
Personally, I quite like the idea of being reincarnated as a panda.

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:49.733
In any case, one animal that I imagine you wouldn’t find many

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:53.633
people saying they want to be reincarnated as is a chicken.

00:01:54.673 --> 00:01:58.123
And especially something called a broiler chicken,

00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:02.223
a chicken bred specifically for human consumption.

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:09.593
The life of a broiler chicken, as you may know, is as unpleasant as it is short.

00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:15.593
These are animals that have been specifically designed with one purpose and one purpose

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:23.283
only: to be turned into animal protein, meat, as quickly and cost-efficiently as possible.

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:29.793
That might be quite a grisly and direct way of putting it, but it’s true.

00:02:31.203 --> 00:02:35.253
And the end result is that chicken has gone from a relatively

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:39.483
luxury good to one of the cheapest sources of protein available.

00:02:40.923 --> 00:02:46.493
100 years ago, in 1923, a kilo of chicken in the USA

00:02:46.803 --> 00:02:52.533
cost around €20, and today it can be as low as €3.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:58.233
And in many supermarkets you can go in and buy a fully roasted

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:03.271
chicken, already cooked, enough to feed a family, for €5 or so.

00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:09.753
So the question we are going to be addressing in the next 15 minutes is…how?

00:03:10.243 --> 00:03:11.393
How is this possible?

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:17.893
How has chicken gone from something of a luxury to something that costs barely more than a cup

00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:22.283
of coffee, at least if you are the kind of person who drinks particularly expensive coffee?

00:03:23.843 --> 00:03:28.313
To address this question, we need to go back and do a little bit of chicken history.

00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:35.613
I say a little bit because the super long term fans and listeners among you might remember that we

00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:42.512
already did an episode on the history of chickens back in March of 2020, it was episode number 34.

00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:47.513
Anyway, if you haven’t listened to that episode, and to give you some brief

00:03:47.513 --> 00:03:52.183
history, chickens are thought to have originated in the jungles of southeast Asia.

00:03:53.423 --> 00:03:58.373
The fact that they are relatively easy to keep and transport from one place to another,

00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:03.413
plus the fact that you can eat them and eat their eggs, this all meant that they

00:04:03.413 --> 00:04:09.553
became domesticated relatively early on, and brought by merchants along trade routes.

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:18.857
There are records of chickens dating back to 2000 BC in Syria, and even in Europe by around 100 BC.

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:24.603
The point is, people have raised chickens for thousands of years.

00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:30.453
But, the chickens that might have been pottering about in Damascus or Rome

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:35.623
or London many hundreds or even thousands of years ago, these were very

00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:40.843
different beasts to the ones you or I might think of when we imagine a chicken.

00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:46.043
Even going back to the start of the 20th century, chickens were very different.

00:04:47.093 --> 00:04:52.368
They were much smaller, with most breeds typically weighing in at just under a

00:04:52.383 --> 00:04:57.253
kilo, less than a quarter of what the heaviest of broiler chickens weigh today.

00:04:58.313 --> 00:05:02.603
In the US, at least, a chicken would typically be raised for its eggs,

00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:06.823
and then when it was no longer so good at producing eggs, or if it

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:10.663
was a male chicken, well it would be killed and eaten for its meat.

00:05:11.473 --> 00:05:16.848
It was a dual purpose bird; it kept on producing something you could eat, in the form of eggs,

00:05:17.278 --> 00:05:22.688
and when it stopped producing that, well you could eat it yourself or sell it for its meat.

00:05:23.998 --> 00:05:28.278
And, again, using the United States as an example, almost all

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:32.928
farms kept chickens, but they weren’t chicken farms per se.

00:05:33.978 --> 00:05:39.768
Chickens were birds that existed alongside other animals, they didn’t require huge amounts

00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:44.178
of maintenance, just some grain, somewhere to lay their eggs and sleep for the night,

00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:49.898
and to be kept out of reach of a hungry fox, that was more or less all that they needed.

00:05:51.108 --> 00:05:57.178
This versatility might have seemed like a positive, a good thing, but it meant

00:05:57.208 --> 00:06:02.448
that the chicken was destined to be a sort of “ancillary” livestock, something

00:06:02.448 --> 00:06:07.468
that farmers kept because they could, rather than as the core focus of a farm.

00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:11.928
Because they were small, and didn’t contain much meat,

00:06:12.328 --> 00:06:15.278
their real value was in their egg-laying ability.

00:06:16.508 --> 00:06:20.608
And chicken meat was something of a luxury, it was expensive.

00:06:21.988 --> 00:06:29.298
Pound for pound, in 1900 chicken was 30% more expensive than beef or pork.

00:06:30.508 --> 00:06:34.168
And in case you weren’t aware, the opposite tends to be true

00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:38.328
nowadays; chicken is almost always cheaper than beef or pork.

00:06:39.028 --> 00:06:40.518
So, what happened?

00:06:41.048 --> 00:06:45.718
Well, the creation of the modern chicken is really a miracle of technology.

00:06:46.948 --> 00:06:52.368
The first important step came in the 1920s with the creation of the electrical egg

00:06:52.418 --> 00:06:58.058
incubator, essentially a machine that keeps eggs at the right warmth and humidity,

00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:03.208
as well as turning them gently, so that they hatch without a chicken sitting on them.

00:07:04.288 --> 00:07:09.648
A chicken egg typically takes around 3 weeks to hatch, so under

00:07:09.648 --> 00:07:13.818
“normal” conditions, a hen sits on the egg for 3 weeks or so.

00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:20.398
This is how an egg is incubated in the natural world, but the problem with this is

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:24.978
that the chicken is “out of action” for all of that time, not producing any more eggs.

00:07:26.398 --> 00:07:29.598
An incubator means that a hen no longer needs to do

00:07:29.598 --> 00:07:33.228
this, so she can be put to work laying more eggs.

00:07:34.608 --> 00:07:41.198
And to clarify, artificial incubation wasn’t invented in the 1920s; humans have tried

00:07:41.198 --> 00:07:45.888
various sorts of artificial incubation going back to the Ancient Egyptians, using

00:07:46.178 --> 00:07:52.568
ovens and so on, but using electricity meant that these incubators were far more

00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:58.338
efficient, and could be built far bigger, incubating thousands of eggs at a time.

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:00.978
So, this was the first step.

00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:08.408
The second step towards modernising the chicken, or at least turning this small jungle bird

00:08:08.588 --> 00:08:13.798
into something eaten by hundreds of millions of people every day, came in the post-war period.

00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:18.848
In 1947 there was a competition announced in America.

00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:23.538
Anyone could take part, and the objective was to create

00:08:23.548 --> 00:08:27.158
a new breed of chicken that would be bigger and cheaper.

00:08:28.298 --> 00:08:32.668
Or, to quote the advert from the original announcement, the objective was to

00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:38.008
breed “one bird chunky enough for the whole family—a chicken with breast meat

00:08:38.008 --> 00:08:42.958
so thick you can carve it into steaks, with drumsticks that contain a minimum

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:48.818
of bone buried in layers of juicy dark meat, all costing less instead of more.”

00:08:50.288 --> 00:08:55.068
In other words, the aim was to breed a massive chicken that could feed

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:59.228
an entire family, not a scrawny bird that was only good for laying

00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:04.008
eggs, and to make it cheaper than any chicken that had come before it.

00:09:04.838 --> 00:09:11.238
It was a huge effort, and to cut a long story short, a man from California called

00:09:11.298 --> 00:09:15.828
Charles Vantress took the first prize with a mix of different breeds of chicken.

00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:22.548
There were some further developments, tinkering, but the result was that the

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:27.628
variety of chickens found on farms in America had gone from hundreds to a handful.

00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:34.368
And these chickens, and indeed the chickens of today that come directly from

00:09:34.368 --> 00:09:38.688
this original competition, were very different from the chickens of the past.

00:09:40.048 --> 00:09:45.648
These “upgraded” chickens were designed to be able to grow much bigger and meatier than

00:09:45.648 --> 00:09:51.298
normal chickens, and their bodies able to withstand doing this in a very short space of time.

00:09:52.768 --> 00:09:56.788
In practical terms, modern broiler chickens can weigh

00:09:56.788 --> 00:10:00.388
4 times what “normal” chickens weighed 100 years ago.

00:10:01.628 --> 00:10:06.758
And they put on this weight incredibly fast, going from a tiny chick

00:10:06.968 --> 00:10:11.668
to their target weight of about 2.5kg in only six or seven weeks.

00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:18.968
And in some cases, in the most efficient broiler chicken farms, this can be as little as five weeks.

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:25.788
To put that in perspective, and even adjusting for the fact that the normal lifespan

00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:31.388
of a chicken is typically between 3 and 10 years, this would be like a human baby

00:10:31.808 --> 00:10:37.928
going from being born to weighing something like 180 kilograms by the age of 2.

00:10:39.858 --> 00:10:43.988
This isn’t only due to the fact that they have been engineered so that

00:10:43.988 --> 00:10:47.748
they can grow this fast, it’s also due to the hormones and in some

00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:51.608
cases genetically modified organisms that their food is pumped with.

00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:56.918
Everything about the short life of a broiler chicken has been engineered

00:10:57.168 --> 00:11:01.168
to allow it to put on as much weight as possible as quickly as possible.

00:11:01.978 --> 00:11:07.898
It is a quite astonishing feat of engineering, but, as you will know, it is not a wonderful life.

00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:14.098
Although the worst of the “battery” cages have been banned in many parts of the

00:11:14.098 --> 00:11:18.858
world, chicken’s bodies are put under enormous pressure during this growth..

00:11:19.898 --> 00:11:25.108
Even life for “free range” or “organic” chickens doesn’t tend to be much better.

00:11:26.368 --> 00:11:32.068
Yes, they might get a whiff of fresh air or be fed slightly better food, but free range

00:11:32.068 --> 00:11:38.718
chickens only live for around 56 days while organic chickens manage to live no longer than 81.

00:11:39.748 --> 00:11:42.838
And they still need to put on a vast amount of weight

00:11:43.148 --> 00:11:46.308
in this slightly-longer-but-still-very-short lifespan.

00:11:47.358 --> 00:11:52.698
It is a miserable life but what this has meant, bringing us closer to the stated

00:11:52.698 --> 00:11:57.108
topic of the “economics of chicken”, is that the price of chicken has fallen

00:11:57.118 --> 00:12:02.498
dramatically, in some cases it’s 5 times less expensive than it was 100 years ago.

00:12:03.498 --> 00:12:07.818
In fact, 100 years ago it was relatively rare for chicken

00:12:07.818 --> 00:12:11.508
to be eaten for its meat, in the UK and the US at least.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:16.808
It was expensive, you didn’t get much meat on a chicken, so it was the

00:12:16.808 --> 00:12:21.678
equivalent of cooking duck or something like that today: a bit complicated,

00:12:22.068 --> 00:12:26.638
quite expensive, a lot of effort for not that many calories in return.

00:12:28.028 --> 00:12:32.938
And now it is literally the most popular source of animal protein in the

00:12:32.938 --> 00:12:38.928
world, and is projected to reach 41% of all meat consumption by 2030,

00:12:39.368 --> 00:12:43.418
according to a report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:48.198
The major reason for this is, of course, price.

00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:53.758
I decided to call this episode The Economics of Chicken because, for

00:12:53.778 --> 00:12:57.588
better or for worse, and certainly for worse if you’re a chicken, the

00:12:57.588 --> 00:13:01.268
question of the modern chicken is a question of economic efficiency.

00:13:02.108 --> 00:13:07.558
The process of taking an egg and turning it into a huge chicken, from the fact that

00:13:07.568 --> 00:13:12.828
it is incubated artificially through to how it is raised very fast and to weigh a

00:13:12.838 --> 00:13:18.638
vast amount before it is slaughtered, every element has been pushed to its maximum in

00:13:18.638 --> 00:13:23.818
terms of efficiency, with a resulting low price tag and a boom in chicken consumption.

00:13:24.966 --> 00:13:29.994
And while many people may say that the lives of chickens are awful and it is

00:13:30.014 --> 00:13:35.074
terrible to raise them in this way, the truth remains that these kinds of low-cost

00:13:35.334 --> 00:13:40.418
intensively-farmed broiler chickens are overwhelmingly the most popular type of chicken.

00:13:41.898 --> 00:13:46.178
According to one report published by The Economist, in the UK,

00:13:46.608 --> 00:13:53.128
intensively farmed chickens make up 95.5% of all chickens, while free

00:13:53.128 --> 00:13:58.468
range makes up 3.5% and organic chickens account for the remaining 1%.

00:13:59.578 --> 00:14:02.548
Long story short, when it comes to chicken, there is

00:14:02.558 --> 00:14:06.578
one factor that matters more than anything else: price.

00:14:07.628 --> 00:14:12.798
Now, there’s one more element of chicken economics I want to cover today, and that is a

00:14:12.828 --> 00:14:18.798
question of why a particular type of chicken is so cheap, or at least is so cheap in the

00:14:18.798 --> 00:14:24.578
UK and in the US but from my experience seems to be similarly cheap in most countries.

00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:29.838
Here I’m talking about rotisserie chicken, the chicken that comes

00:14:29.898 --> 00:14:34.318
pre-cooked and you can buy in supermarkets already roasted and flavoured.

00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:41.328
In the American warehouse supermarket Costco, for example, it costs $4.99,

00:14:42.028 --> 00:14:48.648
and in UK supermarkets they can be found for as little as £4, so under €5,

00:14:49.318 --> 00:14:55.361
the same price and sometimes even lower than the price they are uncooked.

00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:57.908
How, you might be thinking?

00:14:58.368 --> 00:15:03.438
If it’s still a chicken, and then it has to be cooked and then sold separately,

00:15:03.748 --> 00:15:08.328
surely it should be more expensive, not the same price or even cheaper.

00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:15.518
Well, there are a few theories about why this is, why rotisserie chicken is so cheap.

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:23.498
Firstly, in many cases they are what’s called a loss-leader for the shop, meaning

00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:29.618
that the shop loses money on each one it sells, but it continues to sell them because

00:15:29.618 --> 00:15:33.728
it knows that people will buy other more profitable things to go along with it.

00:15:35.108 --> 00:15:40.488
In many stores, you’ll find rotisserie chicken close to higher margin items, like

00:15:40.588 --> 00:15:46.368
wine, so someone buys a “cheap” rotisserie chicken, thinks they got a good deal

00:15:46.648 --> 00:15:50.598
and then buys something more expensive that they might not have bought otherwise.

00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:57.048
Secondly, rotisserie chickens are often smaller than the uncooked chickens.

00:15:57.888 --> 00:16:03.148
You don’t see this when the chickens are in the roaster, in the oven, because the weight

00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:08.188
isn’t generally visible, and you probably don’t care to weigh it when you are actually eating

00:16:08.188 --> 00:16:13.685
one, but you often get less chicken for your money than if you were buying it uncooked.

00:16:15.005 --> 00:16:20.367
Thirdly, and this one is a little more controversial, but it has been suggested that

00:16:20.397 --> 00:16:26.477
some supermarkets move their chickens that are about to go bad from the fridge into

00:16:26.477 --> 00:16:30.847
the rotisserie, knowing that people are unlikely to buy a chicken that is going bad

00:16:30.847 --> 00:16:35.154
that day but if it’s cooked already, then they have a better chance of selling it.

00:16:36.077 --> 00:16:41.247
So, if you are a chicken lover, or a lover of eating chicken perhaps I should say,

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:46.887
and you have ever wondered how the price of rotisserie chicken is so low, this is why.

00:16:47.937 --> 00:16:52.277
Now, I want to finish by briefly touching on some of the ethical questions

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:56.737
of eating chicken, as we've only really skirted around these until now.

00:16:57.907 --> 00:17:01.787
Chicken, as you’ve heard, is the most popular meat on the planet

00:17:01.947 --> 00:17:05.567
by levels of consumption, and it is only growing more popular.

00:17:07.077 --> 00:17:11.517
As you’ve heard here, and as I’m sure you knew already, almost all

00:17:11.537 --> 00:17:16.377
of the 34 billion chickens worldwide live in these intensive broiler

00:17:16.377 --> 00:17:21.367
farms, where they live lives that are as miserable as they are short.

00:17:22.587 --> 00:17:28.427
Sure, there are alternatives, it’s perfectly possible to buy free range or organic

00:17:28.427 --> 00:17:33.091
chicken, chickens that have lived slightly longer and slightly happier lives.

00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:37.937
But these chickens are expensive, in many cases more

00:17:37.937 --> 00:17:40.897
than double the price of an intensively reared chicken.

00:17:42.387 --> 00:17:45.747
As an economist might say, the market has spoken.

00:17:46.657 --> 00:17:51.037
For most people, 95.5% of consumers in the UK at least,

00:17:51.457 --> 00:17:54.867
this simply isn’t a price that we are willing to pay…

00:17:57.387 --> 00:18:01.517
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the economics of chicken.

00:18:01.927 --> 00:18:05.187
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:05.847 --> 00:18:08.577
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:18:09.017 --> 00:18:12.007
How has the popularity of chicken changed in your country?

00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:14.877
Do you eat more or less chicken than before?

00:18:15.467 --> 00:18:20.277
If you don’t eat chicken for ethical reasons, what was the one thing that made you stop?

00:18:20.857 --> 00:18:23.967
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:24.367 --> 00:18:26.887

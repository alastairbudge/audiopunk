Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to a special

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:12.644
episode of English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:14.294
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.759
I'm saying that this is a special episode because I have an announcement and some exciting news.

00:00:24.049 --> 00:00:29.959
Before I say exactly what is happening, I just wanted to update you on how things are

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:35.899
going at the English learning for curious minds podcast since we started last year.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:44.239
This is now the 54th episode that we have released and the podcast has

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.859
been listened to by curious minds from all over the world, 154 countries to be precise.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.769
This year alone, we have had almost a hundred thousand

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:02.899
downloads, which is way, way more than I had ever thought.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.469
And to each and every one of you that has listened to the show I am very grateful.

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:16.849
Normally, the way things work for podcasts is that they accept

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:22.669
a sponsor who then pays to fill each episode with adverts.

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.339
That is the normal route, but I would prefer to not go that way.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:37.744
Instead, I would love for this podcast to be supported by its members, its listeners,

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:43.444
the people who really get value from it, the curious minds from all over the

00:01:43.444 --> 00:01:49.204
world who believe that there is a more interesting way to improve their English.

00:01:49.924 --> 00:01:51.274
People like you.

00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:57.454
I also realise that for a lot of you, you just want to listen.

00:01:57.844 --> 00:02:00.634
You listen to the podcast while you are doing something

00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:05.184
else, and having the transcript and key vocabulary isn't

00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:10.554
necessarily something that fits in with how you want to listen to the podcast.

00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:16.204
So what we have done is launched a new, more

00:02:16.204 --> 00:02:21.064
affordable version of membership called the Listener membership.

00:02:22.574 --> 00:02:28.324
What this means is that you can listen to every single episode, and you'll get access to

00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:35.914
two new ones a week for just five euros a month when you pay per year, so 60 euros per year.

00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:42.514
As a way of celebrating launching this, we've also done something

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:48.724
even better, which is that until May the 10th, which is this coming Sunday,

00:02:49.144 --> 00:02:53.674
you can get this for four euros a month if you take it on the annual plan.

00:02:54.244 --> 00:03:00.610
But you have to use the code April4 so A P R I L four and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.320
that gets you 20% off, so it gets you the membership for four euros a month.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.990
But be quick, we are limiting this to the first 50 members to use the code.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.690
So go and check that out, it is at leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:24.363
From now on, you will need to be a Listener member to get access to all of

00:03:24.363 --> 00:03:30.603
the episodes, so that's our back catalogue and the two new ones that come out every week.

00:03:31.873 --> 00:03:37.573
We will continue to release one episode a week to non-members, so if you

00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:42.553
are happy with just one, then that is fine, life continues as normal.

00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:47.363
But that is not the most exciting news, not at all.

00:03:48.563 --> 00:03:53.513
The reason that I do this podcast is because of you, the listeners

00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:57.593
and members of Leonardo English, and today we are

00:03:57.593 --> 00:04:03.983
announcing two new ways for you to be involved, for you to participate.

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:11.303
Firstly, I want to make podcasts about things that you want to listen to.

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:17.303
And so as a member of Leonardo English, you can now request topics.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:23.933
You can give your own ideas, and I and the team will make podcast episodes about them.

00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:32.278
That might sound mad, but if you want to listen to an episode on black holes or

00:04:32.518 --> 00:04:41.128
the rise of The Beatles or a history of bottled water, then just request it and we will make it.

00:04:42.838 --> 00:04:48.808
And secondly, we are going to do monthly Q&A sessions, question and

00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:54.058
answer sessions, which will give you the chance to ask me questions.

00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:59.143
We will discuss interesting topics and of course you will get

00:04:59.143 --> 00:05:03.313
the chance to practice your English with other curious minds.

00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:09.583
It is going to be a lot of fun and I think it's going to be very useful as well.

00:05:10.813 --> 00:05:16.393
Again, you need to be a member of Leonardo English to request topics and to participate in

00:05:16.393 --> 00:05:23.353
the Q&A's, but these are both things that I am super excited about and I hope you will be too.

00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:29.023
Things are changing, but they are most definitely getting better.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.743
So should you become a member?

00:05:33.373 --> 00:05:34.813
Obviously it's up to you.

00:05:35.593 --> 00:05:40.783
But if you have enjoyed these episodes, you want unlimited access to

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:46.193
everything, plus the chance to be a founding part of a thriving

00:05:46.193 --> 00:05:51.713
community of curious minds and you support our mission of making a more

00:05:51.743 --> 00:05:56.633
interesting way to improve your English, then I would love to welcome you.

00:05:57.653 --> 00:06:02.443
The link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:06:04.253 --> 00:06:10.553
And just as a final reminder, and my wife told me I was mad to do this, but I'm doing it anyway.

00:06:10.973 --> 00:06:15.803
It is just four euros a month or 48 euros a year for the first

00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:20.363
50 people, or until may the 10th, you just need to use the code.

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:25.733
April4 A P R I L then the number four when you sign up.

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:32.243
Do that today and you will get immediate access to everything, including

00:06:32.363 --> 00:06:37.283
today's member only episode, which is all about the British Royal family.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:39.113
It was quite a fun one to make.

00:06:40.043 --> 00:06:45.213
So again, the link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:06:46.898 --> 00:06:51.518
You've been listening to English Learning For Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:06:51.998 --> 00:06:58.328
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe and I very much hope to welcome you as a member soon.

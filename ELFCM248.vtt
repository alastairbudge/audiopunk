Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:17.386
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:21.526
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:28.636
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Antarctic Treaty.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:33.226
I’m sure you are familiar with the so-called White Continent.

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:39.936
Antarctica is a recurring source of fascination for adults and children alike.

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:47.846
An almost mythological place where the mere existence of any life form seems truly miraculous.

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:53.596
But what you might not have spent much time thinking about is who actually

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:59.296
owns Antarctica, is it part of a country at all, and what laws apply there?

00:01:00.076 --> 00:01:04.566
Well, the answer to this is the title of this episode: The Antarctic

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:10.287
Treaty, and in the next 20 or 25 minutes we are going to learn all about it.

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:16.136
We’ll start with a quick overview of the Antarctic, and how it was discovered.

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:22.846
Then we’ll move on to covering some essential questions - Who signed the Antarctic Treaty?

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:27.636
Why was the Antarctic Treaty created and what does it cover?

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:32.816
What does it mean for the future of Antarctica and the planet?

00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:37.186
It’s a fascinating subject, and I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:42.334
Ok then, the Antarctic Treaty.

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:49.514
Antarctica, the world’s fifth-largest and southernmost continent, bigger than

00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:55.104
both Europe and Australia, extends over some 14 million square kilometres.

00:01:56.228 --> 00:02:01.214
Antarctica's inhospitable climate, with an average winter temperature

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:08.004
of around -63°Celsius, makes this windy, ice-covered polar desert

00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:13.234
uninhabitable without the help of modern logistics and technology.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.864
Unsurprisingly, Antarctica is the Earth’s only

00:02:17.864 --> 00:02:21.444
continent that does not have a native human population.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:30.656
Unlike everywhere else on the planet, Antarctica has not been carved up into nation states,

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:36.216
into countries - although territorial claims do exist, which we’ll talk about later.

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:42.876
Its land mass has not been exploited for commercial gain and the

00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:48.716
entire continent is almost completely unchanged by humankind.

00:02:49.376 --> 00:03:05.599
It is amazing when you stop to think about it, Antarctica is the only

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.717
place in the entire world, really, that we have left almost entirely

00:03:05.717 --> 00:03:05.814
untouched, free from human intervention and free from pollution.

00:03:05.814 --> 00:03:12.136
Apart from its 70 permanent research bases with their small numbers of seasonally rotating

00:03:12.136 --> 00:03:19.307
staff, Antarctica remains devoid of, completely free from, permanent human residents.

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:26.416
So, where does the Antarctic Treaty come into this and why was it created?

00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:36.186
Signed on 1 December 1959, the Antarctic Treaty came into force on 23 June 1961.

00:03:37.796 --> 00:03:44.796
While the Treaty’s provisions, its content, has been added to and updated

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:50.166
over the years, the main aim of the Antarctic Treaty is to ensure that the

00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:56.206
Antarctic wilderness is protected as a place devoted to peace and science.

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:01.546
Today, military activity, nuclear explosions and waste,

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:05.496
as well as mining are all banned under the treaty.

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:13.056
Instead, it promotes scientific cooperation and the environmental protection of the Antarctic.

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:19.926
Another extremely important, feature of the Antarctic Treaty is that it effectively

00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:27.166
puts all Antarctic land claims in abeyance and prevents new claims from being made.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:34.476
If something is in abeyance, it means that it is suspended or temporarily set aside.

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:42.596
For reference, Antarctic territorial claims are triangular-shaped territories that split

00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:48.426
Antarctica into different sections, each claim having been made by a different country.

00:04:49.096 --> 00:04:54.096
Their boundaries radiate out from a point at the South Pole like

00:04:54.396 --> 00:04:58.906
spokes on the wheel of a bicycle or the hands on a clock face.

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:06.276
Even today, there are seven existing Antarctic territorial claims, some of which

00:05:06.496 --> 00:05:14.276
overlap, plus an area between 90 and 150° west, near the south Pacific Ocean,

00:05:14.636 --> 00:05:20.806
which is the only major section of land on Earth not to be claimed by any country.

00:05:22.076 --> 00:05:28.016
By not allowing territorial claims the Antarctic Treaty has brought lasting

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:34.236
peace to the continent of Antarctica in a format that is acceptable to both the

00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:39.986
original claimants, the original countries that said that land was theirs, and

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:46.496
the other nations who reject the validity of those original territorial claims.

00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:54.816
Putting these territorial claims into suspension is, in fact, one of the most ingenious,

00:05:54.846 --> 00:06:01.340
or clever, features of the Antarctic Treaty, and one that helped to ensure its adoption.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.390
Furthermore, it also paved the way for increased scientific cooperation and peace.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.710
To better illustrate this point, as well as to gain a greater understanding

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.950
of the importance of the Antarctic Treaty, both for Antarctica and for the

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:26.020
world, let’s take a closer look at how things were in and around Antarctica

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.830
from its discovery in 1820 up to the creation of the Antarctic Treaty in 1959.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.350
As you’ll see, things could have finished very differently.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.960
Let’s first talk about the discovery of Antarctica,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.190
and then move onto the race to reach the South Pole.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:54.330
The idea of the possible existence of a large southern landmass can be traced back

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.710
to Ancient Greece - well before Antarctica was recognised as a continent in 1840.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:09.200
Known as Terra Australis Incognita, or the Unknown Southern Land, early European

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.310
explorers believed that this mystery continent consisted of a huge temperate

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.780
land mass linking the islands off the tip of South America with New Guinea.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:29.180
Numerous 15th and 16th century naval expeditions disproved this theory, pushing

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.810
the likelihood of the existence of an unknown continent further and further south.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.170
The famous British navigator James Cook crossed the Antarctic

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.260
Circle for the first time in 1773 looking for the continent.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.570
On his expedition, Cook proved there was no land bridge

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.940
between the islands off South America and Oceania.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:03.840
After he discovered the South Sandwich Islands in 1774, he came to the conclusion that if there

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:11.480
was a Terra Australis Incognita, it would be beyond the ice barrier and not in the temperate zone.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.650
In short, if a southern continent existed, it would be almost

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.740
inaccessible and of no economic value, so Cook believed.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.900
While a Russian naval expedition led by an explorer named Bellinghausen

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:35.430
was the first to catch sight of Antarctica in 1820, a lot of discoveries

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:40.800
in the Antarctic region were actually made by seal and whale hunters.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:50.470
In fact, the first documented landing on mainland Antarctica was by an American seal hunter in 1853.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:59.580
As you may know, and as you certainly will know if you’ve listened to Episode number 144, whale

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:06.590
and seal hunting were especially important economic activities during the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:13.440
As the whale and seal populations further north continued to reduce, because,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:18.490
well they were all killed, the hunters sailed further and further south

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.520
to try to find fresh, new, untouched sources of whales and seals to hunt.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:34.670
And while history doesn’t tend to look particularly kindly on whaling, the discovery of the

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:42.490
Antarctic landmass was in some respects down to increased demand for whale oil and seal fur.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:50.430
The short, dense fur of the Antarctic fur seal was prized for making ladies’

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:56.590
coats, and by the 1830s these seals were almost wiped out completely.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:03.450
Whale oil, on the other hand, was essential for lubricating the advanced

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.770
machinery that was increasingly used in the Industrial Revolution.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.030
Whale oil was also an important household commodity that was burnt in lamps, as well as

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:23.540
being used in the manufacture, or making, of soap, candles, paint, varnish and textiles.

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:30.550
So, the seas around the Antarctic were a major hunting area that brought

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.910
great riches as well as being important for continued technological advances.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The rush to find virgin, or unexploited, sealing and whaling grounds,

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:48.300
consistently pushed vessels to travel further and further south, which

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.190
also increased awareness and interest in the Antarctic continent.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:11:01.440
After the Magnetic North Pole was located in 1831, the race was on to

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.030
find the Magnetic South Pole, with British, French and American scientific

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:12.570
naval exploratory parties charting large sections of the Antarctic coast.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:19.120
The approximate location of the Magnetic South Pole was identified

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:24.860
but at the time it was over land and therefore inaccessible by boat.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:32.520
A 50-year hiatus, or break, in scientific Antarctic exploration followed.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:37.370
Seals continued to be hunted to the brink of extinction,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.200
although petroleum increasingly replaced whale oil.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.800
However, the whales weren’t quite off the hook yet, they weren’t safe yet.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:53.030
There was still a huge demand for baleen, which is also known as whalebone.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.000
Baleen comes from the large plate-like structures that

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.160
are found in the mouths of certain types of whales.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:08.570
They act as sieves, or filters, catching tiny marine organisms that the whales consume.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:17.550
Given its highly durable yet flexible qualities, baleen was the “plastic” of the 1800s

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:24.330
and it was used to make a wide variety of items, not least of all, women’s corsets.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:31.110
Now armed with better boats, whaling parties had to once again cover

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.850
mostly uncharted, or unknown, territory in their attempts to find

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.120
more whales to feed the ever-growing appetite for whale products.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:47.700
In 1895, a whaling expedition made the first-ever landing to collect

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.990
biological and geological specimens on the Antarctic mainland.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.870
While there had been at least one previously documented landing and the

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:03.060
region was increasingly mapped, this was one of the very first landings

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:08.310
on the continent and it went on to inspire the scientific community.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:16.790
In that very same year of 1895, participants in the Sixth International Geographical Congress

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:23.950
called for greater exploration of the Antarctic regions, inspiring the race to reach the South Pole.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.210
Explorers and scientists alike took up the challenge with no less than seventeen expeditions

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:36.990
from eight different countries taking place in Antarctica over the next 27 years.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.660
Activity

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.850
in the Antarctic had now switched from economic profit to scientific

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.780
investigation, as well as bolstering, promoting, national pride.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.890
As you may know, the South Pole was first reached by a party of Norwegian

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:03.970
Explorers under the command of a man named Roald Amundsen on December 14th 1911.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:10.950
Other expeditions made extensive exploratory surveys, often accompanied by daring

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.060
tales of survival after ships were crushed by ice leaving their crew stranded.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:25.350
However, while the early explorations up to the late 1930s were mainly privately

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:31.500
funded with some government support, countries around the world became increasingly

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.810
aware of Antarctica's potential scientific, economic and strategic importance.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:44.120
Great tracts, or areas, of Antarctica were claimed by countries

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.220
including Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France, Argentina and Chile.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:54.890
Some areas overlapped and other countries who were yet to make

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.240
a territorial claim disputed the existing claims’ validity.

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:06.140
During the 1940 and 50s, these Antarctic land claims became a source of

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:12.610
international conflict, later stoked, or worsened, by the tensions of the Cold War.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:22.460
In 1947, after the Second World War, America sent a large military task force to Antarctica to test

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:29.960
materials and train soldiers for combat in extreme cold for a hypothetical war in the Antarctic.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:39.100
In 1948, Argentina sent eight warships to the Antarctic, leading to the signing of the Tripartite

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:46.140
Naval Declaration by Argentina, Britain and Chile, all countries with overlapping claims.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:53.870
By signing this new declaration, all three countries promised not to send any warships

00:15:54.350 --> 00:16:00.110
south of the 60th South parallel, the line just above the Antarctic continent.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:06.640
But while this declaration was designed to stop large-scale hostilities

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:12.060
from occurring over the disputed and overlapping Argentinian-Chilean-British

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.530
sector, it did not put an end to the territorial disputes.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:26.060
In 1953, 32 royal marines, British soldiers, descended from a British warship on Deception

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:32.360
Island, an island just above the 60th South parallel in the South Shetland Islands.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.220
The two Argentinian sailors who were present on the island were captured

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.600
and the settlements built by both Argentina and Chile were destroyed.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.630
Britain filed claims with the International Court of Justice, declaring the territorial

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:56.990
claims of Argentina and Chile in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic to be invalid.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.600
But who actually owned this island?

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.530
What laws applied?

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.370
Clearly, something had to be done.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:13.280
As international tensions over Antarctica began to boil dangerously

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.750
high, an international scientific project called the International

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.210
Geophysical Year managed to turn the tide in the Antarctic.

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:28.060
Sixty-seven countries took part in collaborative experiments,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:34.710
lasting from July 1st 1957 - December 31st of 1958.

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:41.100
And they discovered that, actually, working together wasn’t so bad after all.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:47.700
All 12 of the countries that had actively committed to researching in Antarctica

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:53.780
for the event, including those with territorial claims, agreed that their research

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:59.330
programmes would be improved by continued scientific cooperation in the Antarctic.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:06.490
These 12 countries, namely, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan,

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:12.670
New Zealand, Norway, the Union of South Africa, the USSR, the UK and the USA,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:18.960
they decided to put their legal and political differences to one side and began

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.710
to negotiate an agreement that governed how Antarctica worked from a legal and

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.640
political point of view, an agreement that would become the Antarctic Treaty.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.430
So, what does the Antarctic treaty do?

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.370
It set aside territorial disputes, promoted scientific

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.265
cooperation and ensured demilitarisation of the continent.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:49.750
The treaty clearly stated that Antarctica is to be used for peaceful purposes

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:55.940
only, remaining free from nuclear tests and the disposal of nuclear waste.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:02.930
Over the years, more and more countries have signed up to the Antarctic Treaty, and it

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:09.680
currently numbers 54 signatories, accounting for more than 80% of the world’s population.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.660
As the world we live in has evolved, so has the Antarctic Treaty.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.790
Further conventions and protocols have been added to ensure the best

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:26.120
protection on-going of the Antarctic, including a ban on all types of

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:31.570
mining or mineral extraction apart from those related to scientific study.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:37.120
The Antarctic Treaty is often hailed, or praised, as

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.510
being one of the most successful international agreements.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:46.920
It has allowed us to increase our understanding of the Earth and protection of the environment,

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:53.210
as well as being one of the most exemplary treaties promoting peaceful cooperation.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.990
So much so, that some people go as far as to consider the Antarctic Treaty

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:05.270
as being an example of the principle of the common heritage of humanity.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:11.440
This is the idea that certain cultural, natural and territorial areas

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:16.500
should be protected from exploitation by corporations or individual states

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:21.370
and preserved by the international community for future generations.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:28.560
Now, you may be wondering how the future will pan out for the Antarctic and its treaty.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:35.600
As with all continents, it’s very likely that the Antarctic contains valuable natural resources.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:41.850
Currently, it’s thought that it wouldn’t be commercially viable to extract

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:47.290
these resources, plus commercial mining is banned under the Antarctic Treaty.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.380
The worry is though, could future generations go back on the

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.360
treaty and start commercial exploitation of the Antarctic?

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.370
Well, the Treaty is fairly robust, it's strong.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:09.400
The treaty itself is indefinite, as is the treaty’s Madrid Protocol that bans mining.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:17.150
While there is the option to amend, to change the protocol, it would require unanimous,

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:23.910
or total, agreement of all of the consultative parties to do so before the year 2048.

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:32.520
After 2048 - 50 years after the Madrid Protocol in 1998 - a single consultative

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:37.390
member will be able to propose an amendment which would then have to go to a vote.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:43.770
This vote would need to be approved by three-quarters of all of the consultative

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:49.204
parties, including all 26 who were consultative parties in the year 1991.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.148
In plain English, it would require almost everyone to agree, and that

00:21:52.148 --> 00:21:52.170
doesn’t seem to be very likely.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:52.192
To my mind, however,

00:21:52.192 --> 00:21:52.214
there is one potential glaringly

00:21:52.214 --> 00:21:52.247
obvious problem with the Antarctic Treaty.

00:21:52.247 --> 00:22:02.900
Its Achilles heel could be its speed or rather lack thereof.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:15.870
As the Antarctic Treaty relies on consensus-based, or approval,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.910
decision making, it is very slow to make progress on major issues.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:29.090
Climate change and Antarctic tourism were not anticipated when the original treaty was drawn up.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:36.480
While additional protocols have put measures in place, this has been reactive rather than

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:43.330
proactive, reacting to current and past situations rather than anticipating the future.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.590
While it may not be perfect, the Antarctic Treaty is undoubtedly

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.510
one of the most successful sets of international agreements.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.890
Even more astounding, is that it was signed during the

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.060
Cold War, a period of extreme geopolitical tensions.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.522
The Antarctic Treaty ensures the environmental protection of an

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:10.810
entire continent through international commitments and cooperation.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:17.350
And that for me is captivating, fascinating, and a wonderful example of

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:22.460
just what can be achieved when we work together, united for a common good.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:30.340
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on the Antarctic Treaty.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.840
I hope that it’s been an interesting one, and that you’ve learned a bit about the Earth's most

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.760
inhospitable continent as well as the history that led to the Antarctic Treaty’s creation.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.700
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:52.100
Do you think the Antarctic Treaty is an example of the common heritage of humanity,

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:56.970
that Antarctica is a place that should be preserved for future generations?

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.470
Do you think that the Antarctic Treaty will stand

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.770
the test of modern times and changes to world order?

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:11.100
Should we limit tourism to the Antarctic or is there a responsible way to go about promoting it?

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.320
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

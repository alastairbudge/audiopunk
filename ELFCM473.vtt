Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.709
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.619
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.699
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:27.149
about the sensitive but important subject of euthanasia.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.099
Specifically, we are going to be talking about The Netherlands, the first country to legalise

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:39.839
euthanasia, and a country in which 1 in 20 people who die every year do so by choice.

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:45.139
As you might expect, we will be covering some sensitive material, so please

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.699
take this as a little warning as we will be talking about life and death.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:55.929
OK then, let’s get started and talk about Euthanasia In The Netherlands.

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:04.009
King George VI of Britain, Sigmund Freud and Socrates might seem to have little in common.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.759
One was a British king, one was the Austrian father of

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.159
psychoanalysis, and another was a Greek philosopher.

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:15.709
They lived centuries apart, in different countries

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.579
and societies, and were clearly very different people.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.759
But they had one thing in common.

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.259
They died through euthanasia.

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.489
But how they did this underlines quite the variety of this term that might seem simple, euthanasia.

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:40.789
King George VI of Britain was given a lethal injection of morphine and cocaine by his doctor.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.269
He was suffering from lung cancer, and to ease his pain in his final hours, his

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:53.319
doctors decided to give the terminally ill man this cocktail of drugs, killing him.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.989
Morphine also played a role in Sigmund Freud’s death.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:04.119
He was suffering, in agonising pain from throat cancer, and he asked his

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.009
friend Max Shur to give him a large morphine injection, which killed him.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.399
Socrates was a little different.

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.289
He was neither old nor physically ill.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:19.059
He had been sentenced to death by an Athenian judge

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:21.659
after being found guilty of corrupting the young.

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:27.829
His sentence was to drink poison, made out of a toxic plant called hemlock.

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:34.759
Now, you are probably thinking that this doesn’t sound like euthanasia, but it technically was.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:40.979
Socrates was handed the poison by an executioner, and then he drank it

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:46.459
himself, so he brought about his own death, even if he didn’t wish for it.

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:53.604
Euthanasia has been in the news a lot in the past months, with two unrelated

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:58.719
cases in the Netherlands, the first of a former Prime Minister who chose to

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:05.249
end his life at the age of 93, together with his wife, and of a young Dutch

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:11.659
woman, Zoraya ter Beek, who has chosen to end her life at the age of 28.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.149
We’ll talk more about these two cases in a little bit, but first it’s important

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.199
to go through some definitions of what euthanasia is and the different

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.249
categories of it before we come back to the unique case of The Netherlands.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.349
If you know your Greek, you will remember that the word “euthanasia”

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:39.389
comes from “eu”, meaning good, and “thanatos”, meaning death.

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:45.829
In other words, it means a good or happy death, a wished-for death.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.559
There are three categories of euthanasia: voluntary, non-voluntary, and involuntary.

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.199
Voluntary involves the explicit request or consent of a

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.489
terminally ill or suffering individual to end their life.

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:09.989
In other words, the person decides that they wish to end their life, it is their decision.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.149
Non-voluntary involves ending the life of an individual who is unable to

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:21.599
give consent, such as an infant, someone in a vegetative state, like a

00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:26.754
coma, or an adult with advanced dementia or severe mental incapacities.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:31.589
In other words, the person does not have the ability to decide for

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:36.449
themselves; someone else does it for them, but it is in their best interests.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.229
And finally, there is involuntary.

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:47.409
This is when a person’s life is ended against their will, often without their knowledge or consent.

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:54.189
In other words, it's when someone’s life is ended even though that person might not want to die.

00:04:55.369 --> 00:05:03.089
Now, the lines between these categories, particularly between non-voluntary and involuntary, are

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:10.299
often blurry, which is one of the reasons why it is such a tricky legal, moral and ethical area.

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:16.089
And we can even go one level deeper with this categorisation,

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.099
we can split euthanasia into active and passive.

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:24.699
Active euthanasia involves a person killing themself.

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:28.239
This could be a doctor prescribing them a lethal dose

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:32.049
of drugs, but that patient administering it themselves.

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:36.089
You might have heard this referred to as “assisted suicide”.

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:40.889
Or it could involve the doctor administering the lethal dose

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.549
of whatever it is, so the person’s life is ended by a doctor.

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.939
Passive euthanasia, on the other hand, is the withdrawal of

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.409
life-saving care from someone, which leads to their death.

00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:02.049
For example, if someone is in a vegetative state, on a life support machine, their family may opt

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:08.799
to “pull the plug”, as the expression goes, removing their life support and thus ending their life.

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:16.089
In every case, the outcome is the same, but the legal treatments are very different.

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:24.399
In some countries, all forms of euthanasia, including the withdrawal of life-support, are illegal,

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:30.439
and a doctor can be put on trial for murder if someone dies in this way under their watch.

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:38.679
In others, such as The Netherlands, most are legal, including non-assisted voluntary euthanasia,

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:45.039
as in the case of Zoraya ter Beek, the 28-year-old Dutch woman who has chosen to end her life.

00:06:46.209 --> 00:06:51.009
The only thing that is illegal in every country in the world is involuntary

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.059
euthanasia, the killing of someone who does not give their consent.

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:01.469
Some countries did legalise this, for example, Nazi Germany, when an

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:07.849
estimated 300,000 people with mental or physical “defects” were killed, but

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.929
these are all looked back on as horrific experiments intended to “cleanse” a

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:17.229
population of people who were considered less desirable, for whatever reason.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.739
Fortunately, non-voluntary euthanasia is treated as a form

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:25.899
of murder in every legal system around the world today.

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:33.069
Now, as to the legality of different types of euthanasia, this comes down to the

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:38.489
religious, moral and ethical views of the societies and people that make the laws.

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:46.219
In most Islamic countries, for example, all forms of euthanasia are forbidden, as Islam states

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:52.149
that all human life is given by Allah, so another human shouldn’t be able to take it away.

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:57.579
In countries with a strong Roman Catholic population, it is a

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:02.409
similar story, with all forms of euthanasia tending to be prohibited.

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:06.749
The Catholic Church’s official position is that all forms

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:11.109
of euthanasia are murder, for a similar reason to Islam’s.

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:16.889
And as a general rule, the more god-fearing a population,

00:08:17.179 --> 00:08:20.789
the less likely euthanasia is to be legal in that country.

00:08:21.669 --> 00:08:28.079
There are many exceptions to this, for example, Spain and Colombia both have majority Catholic

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:35.019
populations but allow euthanasia, but as a general rule, the more present religion is in the

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:40.389
day-to-day lives of a country's citizens, the less likely that country is to allow euthanasia.

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:44.429
And this brings us to the case of The Netherlands.

00:08:45.129 --> 00:08:50.719
The Dutch have proved themselves to be trailblazers in many different ways, adopting legal

00:08:50.719 --> 00:08:57.249
frameworks for many things that used to be illegal, and often are still illegal, in other countries.

00:08:57.969 --> 00:09:03.829
From same-sex marriage to drug use and prostitution, the Netherlands has shown a tolerance

00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:10.169
for behaviours that people clearly want to engage in, but were previously considered illegal.

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:14.959
And euthanasia evidently falls into that category.

00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:20.989
It is a sad reality that 700,000 people across the world kill themselves every

00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:27.699
year, that’s one person every 40 seconds, making up 1.3% of all deaths worldwide.

00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:35.549
Unfortunately, for almost a million people a year, life is so unbearable that they choose to end it.

00:09:36.749 --> 00:09:40.859
And in the early 1970s, a Dutch doctor called Andries

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:45.119
Postma, found himself dealing with a situation like this.

00:09:45.909 --> 00:09:49.129
His elderly mother-in-law was severely handicapped,

00:09:49.439 --> 00:09:53.029
had a brain haemorrhage, was deaf, and couldn’t speak.

00:09:53.819 --> 00:09:58.299
She was suffering, in great pain, and had repeatedly pleaded

00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:02.419
with her daughter, who was also a doctor, to end her life.

00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:07.599
Eventually, her daughter agreed, and together with her husband,

00:10:07.909 --> 00:10:11.979
injected her with morphine, killing her mother out of compassion.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:18.369
The daughter told the director of the nursing home what had happened, and she and

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:24.109
her husband found themselves facing criminal charges, and up to 12 years in prison.

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:28.349
This became a national case in The Netherlands, which

00:10:28.349 --> 00:10:31.159
still had a strong Christian tradition at the time.

00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:36.079
It ignited passionate debate and ultimately paved the way

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:40.609
for the full legalisation of euthanasia, which came in 2002.

00:10:41.619 --> 00:10:45.339
So, what does modern Dutch law actually say?

00:10:46.459 --> 00:10:51.059
According to the official website of The Netherlands, the only time when a life can be

00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:57.689
legally ended is “where a patient is experiencing unbearable suffering with no prospect

00:10:57.689 --> 00:11:03.049
of improvement and the attending physician fulfils the statutory due care criteria.”

00:11:04.199 --> 00:11:08.379
And although euthanasia is now legal in several other European

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:12.879
countries, the wording of the Dutch law is the most liberal.

00:11:13.859 --> 00:11:19.369
In Spain, for example, the law states that people with "serious and incurable"

00:11:19.369 --> 00:11:24.429
diseases that cause "unbearable suffering" can legally apply for euthanasia,

00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:30.419
whereas the Dutch law doesn’t require the person to have any kind of disease at all.

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:37.319
And this was what made the news about Zoraya ter Beek particularly shocking to many.

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:47.589
On April 1st of this year, of 2024, The Free Press published an article with the headline ‘I’m 28.

00:11:47.929 --> 00:11:50.089
And I’m Scheduled to Die in May.’

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:55.339
The picture it led with was of ter Beek being cuddled

00:11:55.349 --> 00:11:57.839
by her partner, looking straight at the camera.

00:11:58.589 --> 00:12:02.429
She wasn’t exactly smiling, but she didn’t look sad either.

00:12:03.549 --> 00:12:10.289
And in the interview, she revealed her pain, that despite being in a loving relationship, she

00:12:10.289 --> 00:12:16.559
was deeply depressed, she had been feeling this way for years, and she wanted to end her life.

00:12:18.039 --> 00:12:20.709
And…legally, she was allowed to.

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:26.999
She met the legal definition of experiencing unbearable suffering with no prospect of improvement.

00:12:27.599 --> 00:12:32.389
She had always felt like this, she had no prospect that she would ever improve.

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:38.849
A doctor had assessed her over a long period of time and came to this conclusion.

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:44.229
She had the right to die, and perhaps by the time you

00:12:44.229 --> 00:12:47.409
listen to this, there will be no more Zoraya ter Beek.

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:52.849
Reading through the reactions to the article, as you

00:12:52.849 --> 00:12:56.219
might imagine, there were passionate voices on both sides.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:03.149
To many, this seemed like a dangerous step, allowing young people to “check out” of

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:09.239
life, and glorifying killing themselves, glorifying the ultimate irreversible decision.

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:15.689
To others, it was a welcome example of the fact that depression and mental illness can

00:13:15.719 --> 00:13:21.049
cause just as much suffering as any kind of physical illness, and that it should be

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:26.569
this woman’s choice and hers alone whether she can live with the pain that it brings.

00:13:28.119 --> 00:13:31.989
On the very other end of the spectrum was another famous case from The

00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:37.879
Netherlands this year of Dries and Eugenie van Agt, who were both 93 years old.

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:44.279
Dries van Agt was the Dutch prime minister from 1977 to 1982,

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:49.019
so, shortly after the landmark case of Dr Postma and his wife.

00:13:50.319 --> 00:13:54.229
Both he and his wife of 70 years were in very poor

00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:58.399
health, but did not want to die and leave the other alone.

00:13:59.739 --> 00:14:02.799
Instead, they chose to end their lives together,

00:14:03.359 --> 00:14:07.379
hand in hand, and legally they were allowed to do so.

00:14:08.599 --> 00:14:14.189
Now, these are just two cases, one of almost 10,000 euthanasia cases

00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:18.499
a year in the Netherlands, each with unique circumstances, and each

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:22.149
involving multiple medical professionals before they are approved.

00:14:23.239 --> 00:14:27.579
So, is this the future, a sign of a more humane and

00:14:27.869 --> 00:14:30.959
caring society in which people are not forced to suffer?

00:14:31.759 --> 00:14:34.749
Or is it a step down a dangerous path?

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:41.009
To the proponents of euthanasia, the main argument boils down to

00:14:41.039 --> 00:14:46.179
self-determination; the right of an individual to control their destiny, to

00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:49.909
do whatever they want with their lives, so long as they do not harm others.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:56.989
There is also the question of compassion; that it is far kinder to let

00:14:56.989 --> 00:15:01.859
someone die rather than to force them to continue to live against their will.

00:15:03.498 --> 00:15:10.628
And moving into what might seem like a more practical argument, some proponents of euthanasia point

00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:16.658
to the fact that directing medical resources towards people who do not want to live is morally

00:15:16.658 --> 00:15:23.368
wrong, as these could be used to help save or prolong the lives of people who do not want to die.

00:15:24.988 --> 00:15:30.198
On the other side of the divide, the greatest criticisms of euthanasia typically

00:15:30.198 --> 00:15:35.178
come from those approaching the subject from a religious perspective, with most major

00:15:35.178 --> 00:15:41.368
world religions opposing euthanasia in all forms, arguing that all life is sacred and

00:15:41.538 --> 00:15:46.468
it should not be a person’s right to take away what has been given to them by God.

00:15:47.728 --> 00:15:53.228
And even disregarding religion for a moment, other critics point to the potential

00:15:53.238 --> 00:15:59.658
for abuse, that euthanasia becomes a sort of more socially acceptable form of

00:15:59.658 --> 00:16:05.528
suicide, and encourages people to end their lives when they might otherwise not have.

00:16:07.108 --> 00:16:12.518
Similarly, there are arguments that legalising and normalising euthanasia, especially

00:16:12.518 --> 00:16:17.908
among people who are not physically sick, will place society on a slippery slope.

00:16:19.698 --> 00:16:24.408
Remember, the Dutch law states that euthanasia is legal “where a patient

00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:28.548
is experiencing unbearable suffering with no prospect of improvement

00:16:28.908 --> 00:16:33.418
and the attending physician fulfils the statutory due care criteria.”

00:16:34.348 --> 00:16:41.778
“Unbearable suffering” is deliberately unspecific, so if this kind of wording becomes the norm

00:16:41.988 --> 00:16:48.208
for euthanasia legislation worldwide, this sets a dangerous precedent, so the critics say.

00:16:49.198 --> 00:16:52.268
Unbearable suffering could be because of some crippling

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:56.358
disease, but could it also be because of a bad break-up?

00:16:56.838 --> 00:16:58.268
Fear about climate change?

00:16:58.698 --> 00:16:59.988
Getting badly into debt?

00:17:01.428 --> 00:17:06.728
To the critics of this legislation, “unbearable suffering” feels unbearable

00:17:07.028 --> 00:17:12.118
and like it has no prospect of improvement, but this isn’t always the case.

00:17:13.028 --> 00:17:16.988
Normalising euthanasia is going to result in a load of people ending

00:17:16.988 --> 00:17:21.758
their lives who might otherwise have gone on to happy and healthy futures.

00:17:23.108 --> 00:17:29.228
But, to these critics, The Netherlands provides a useful blueprint on what

00:17:29.238 --> 00:17:34.158
happens when you legalise euthanasia, or at least, the country has a now 20-year

00:17:34.198 --> 00:17:39.148
track record of what happens when you allow people to choose to end their lives.

00:17:40.188 --> 00:17:41.838
So, what does happen?

00:17:43.258 --> 00:17:49.358
Today, euthanasia accounts for between 4 and 5% of deaths in The Netherlands.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.128
Are these people who would have died shortly after anyway, like the

00:17:54.128 --> 00:17:58.908
mother-in-law of Andries Postma or the 93-year-old Prime Minister and his wife?

00:17:59.658 --> 00:18:02.378
Or are they people like Zoraya ter Beek?

00:18:03.558 --> 00:18:07.908
In other words, are people choosing to die who would otherwise have lived?

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:13.408
The statistics show that since euthanasia was legalised, the death rate

00:18:13.438 --> 00:18:17.758
in the Netherlands didn’t increase, it actually decreased slightly.

00:18:18.838 --> 00:18:24.648
Now, this is not to suggest that this had anything to do with euthanasia, but to those who

00:18:24.648 --> 00:18:30.248
warned that it might set a dangerous precedent and lead to many more people deciding to end

00:18:30.248 --> 00:18:35.938
their lives because euthanasia was legal, this simply hasn’t happened in the Netherlands.

00:18:37.008 --> 00:18:42.118
In the case of The Netherlands, legalising euthanasia was controversial when it was first

00:18:42.118 --> 00:18:48.778
proposed, but it has proved popular with its citizens, and there are calls to go even further.

00:18:49.568 --> 00:18:55.508
One recent poll suggested that 80% of Dutch people would support a bill legalising

00:18:55.508 --> 00:19:02.098
euthanasia if someone aged over 75 believed that their life was “complete”.

00:19:02.948 --> 00:19:09.178
This would clearly be a big step, as it wouldn’t require any form of unbearable suffering.

00:19:10.268 --> 00:19:15.938
To its supporters, it is the logical next step towards a more compassionate society.

00:19:16.787 --> 00:19:24.308
But to its critics, this is one step too far, a sign of a society that has lost its direction.

00:19:25.802 --> 00:19:31.092
In many other progressive policies, where the Dutch have gone, other countries have followed.

00:19:32.052 --> 00:19:38.152
In 2001, a year before euthanasia was legalised, The Netherlands became the first country in the

00:19:38.152 --> 00:19:45.462
world to legalise same-sex marriage, and since then 35 different countries have followed suit.

00:19:46.352 --> 00:19:51.382
But as far as euthanasia is concerned, despite the Netherlands’ 20-year history

00:19:51.382 --> 00:19:56.262
of legalisation, fewer than a dozen countries worldwide have legalised it.

00:19:57.352 --> 00:20:02.752
Whatever your thoughts on the rights and wrongs of euthanasia, the Dutch example gives us

00:20:02.772 --> 00:20:08.172
a window into a society in which people have the right to choose when to end their lives.

00:20:08.942 --> 00:20:14.572
Whether that’s a utopia or a dystopia, well, that is for you to decide.

00:20:16.522 --> 00:20:19.812
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Euthanasia

00:20:19.822 --> 00:20:22.812
In The Netherlands, and on euthanasia more generally.

00:20:23.492 --> 00:20:26.462
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new

00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:30.382
about this subject that I imagine is also a talking point in your country.

00:20:31.282 --> 00:20:34.202
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:34.512 --> 00:20:36.602
Is euthanasia legal in your country?

00:20:37.052 --> 00:20:41.052
If so, when was it legalised, and what do people think about it?

00:20:41.632 --> 00:20:43.952
And where do you stand on the issue?

00:20:44.582 --> 00:20:47.582
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

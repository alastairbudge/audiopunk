Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and it's another day at the English Learning for Curious Minds

00:00:10.783 --> 00:00:12.883
podcast by Leonardo English.

00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:16.153
I'm Alastair Budge and welcome to the show.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:21.283
The subject of today's podcast is carbon offsetting.

00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:30.323
We'll explain what it is, how it works, why some people love it, praising it as an effective

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:36.953
solution towards limiting climate change, while others think it is a load of rubbish, and just

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:41.093
another example of us kicking the can further down the road.

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:47.573
I'm quite excited about this one and it's something that's pretty close to my heart, although you'll

00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:52.493
have to wait until the end of the podcast to find out what I really think about it.

00:00:53.423 --> 00:00:59.123
Before we get right into it though, let me just take a minute to remind those of you without the key

00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:04.943
vocabulary and transcript in front of you that you can grab a copy of it and become a member of

00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:09.683
Leonardo English over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:17.713
Members get the transcripts and key vocabulary now also downloadable in shiny new PDF format for

00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:24.433
every podcast we've ever released, plus, of course, you'll get two new ones zooming into your inbox

00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:25.153
every week.

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:32.803
And in case you were not aware, the promotional early bird price of just nine euros per month is

00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:39.743
coming to an end at midnight on January the 31st, so if you want to lock in that super low

00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:46.223
promotional price, then make sure you head over and grab yourself a membership before midnight on

00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:47.183
the 31st.

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:51.453
Head to Leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:55.193
Okay then carbon offsetting.

00:01:55.943 --> 00:02:02.128
You have probably heard of it, and you probably even have an idea about what it is.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:11.279
But in today's podcast we are going to dig a little bit deeper, explain how it really works, talk

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:18.179
through some of the pros and cons, and you can make your own mind up as to whether you think it's a

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.629
good idea.

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:26.091
I'm going to skip over the part where we all agree that global warming is a huge existential problem

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.261
and we should do whatever we can to minimise our carbon footprint.

00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:32.061
I think that's almost a given.

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:42.517
So carbon offsetting is one way that has been proposed for mainly Western countries that are pumping

00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:52.727
carbon into the atmosphere to offset, to counteract their actions by paying for initiatives that

00:02:52.727 --> 00:02:55.247
reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.

00:02:55.877 --> 00:03:03.947
Either initiatives that stop carbon going into the air in the first place or that remove, that take

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:06.917
out, CO2 from the atmosphere.

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:16.202
The idea is that you have a 'carbon damage' balance, so that's the amount of carbon that you're

00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:23.162
responsible for putting into the air, which can be from driving a car, taking planes, heating or

00:03:23.162 --> 00:03:29.912
cooling your home, eating meat, or doing anything else that is putting carbon into the air.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.830
And then you have a 'carbon repair' balance, which is the amount of carbon that you are responsible

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.910
for taking out of the atmosphere, either through doing things that actually take CO2 out of the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:52.370
atmosphere, like planting trees, which absorb CO2 or through not putting it into the atmosphere in

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:00.170
the first place, so for example, financing clean energy projects, so that the energy is generated

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.300
without emitting carbon in the first place.

00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:13.901
To go what is called 'carbon neutral', your carbon damage minus your carbon repair needs to be below

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.160
zero, think of it like a bank balance.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:25.036
This typically happens by people paying for carbon repair in the form of carbon offsets.

00:04:25.813 --> 00:04:33.973
So when you hear about rockstars, companies or even countries saying that they are carbon neutral,

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:40.744
it doesn't mean that they are responsible for no emissions, but it means that their emissions or

00:04:40.744 --> 00:04:47.794
their carbon damage is offset by the carbon repair activities they are doing.

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:57.109
The slightly strange thing about this is that it's perfectly possible to fly all the way around the

00:04:57.109 --> 00:05:06.139
world on a private jet and burn coal all day long, but if you pay enough to offset these activities,

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:09.379
technically you are still carbon neutral.

00:05:10.799 --> 00:05:18.526
What's more the cost of these carbon repair, these carbon offsetting activities, on a personal level

00:05:18.856 --> 00:05:22.666
is actually probably quite a lot less than you might think.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.960
Offsetting a return flight from London to San Francisco, for example, would be about 20 pounds and

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.640
offsetting a year's driving might be another 20 pounds, depending on the type of car that you drive

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.330
of course.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:47.820
Add all of these up to calculate the cost on a personal level, and it might seem like quite a small

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.990
price to pay for the prize of saving the planet.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:00.600
So it all sounds pretty good in theory, if we all just knew our carbon damage and made sure that it

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.270
was offset by our carbon repair, is that just the solution to global warming?

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.080
Well, no, it's not quite so simple.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:21.950
Despite its apparent simplicity, carbon offsetting has its fair share of critics and for some valid

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.400
reasons.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.160
George Monbiot, a famous environmental journalist from the British newspaper The Guardian compared

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:39.020
it to the ancient Catholic church's practice of selling indulgences, which is where you would be

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:47.060
absolved, you'd be forgiven for your sins, and you would have reduced time in purgatory, in return

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.370
for financial donations, in return for money given to the church.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:03.190
He said that carbon offsets allow us to buy complacency, political apathy and self-satisfaction.

00:07:04.835 --> 00:07:12.335
In plain English, it means that if there is an option for people to just pay the fine, to pay up, in

00:07:12.335 --> 00:07:16.775
exchange for their bad behaviour, they will just do it.

00:07:17.384 --> 00:07:24.824
It allows people to continue to engage in all of these activities that are very carbon-heavy, and

00:07:24.824 --> 00:07:32.414
are big contributors to global warming, but not feel guilty because they are now carbon neutral as

00:07:32.414 --> 00:07:34.514
they have paid to offset their carbon.

00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:38.534
You want to take a flight for a weekend away?

00:07:38.654 --> 00:07:42.524
Sure, you shouldn't feel bad about it because you can offset your carbon.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:51.899
The criticism is that it doesn't address the root cause of global warming and in order to have any

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:58.379
chance of reducing the carbon in the atmosphere, people's behaviour needs to change.

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:06.749
By promoting carbon offsets, the argument goes, there is no incentive for people's behaviour to

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:07.229
change.

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:15.749
What's more, it's actually going the other way as society is saying that it's acceptable to just pay

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:17.009
up and offset it.

00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:27.040
People often make the comparison between carbon offsetting and things like daycare centre late fees

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:35.365
where in order to deter, to discourage, parents from being late, from picking up their children from

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:43.705
daycare, from nursery, some daycare centres started to add fines, financial punishments, every time

00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:44.875
a parent was late.

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:53.215
It was intended to be a deterrent, to reduce the amount of times that parents were late to pick up

00:08:53.215 --> 00:08:57.925
their children, but actually had completely the opposite effect.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:05.140
The frequency of parents being late actually increased because they felt they could just pay the

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.030
fine and get on with it.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:16.164
Critics of carbon offsetting also claimed that many projects will only have positive effects five,

00:09:16.244 --> 00:09:19.374
ten or twenty years down the line, in the future.

00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:24.414
This is especially the case for things like tree planting.

00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:33.324
Trees, obviously don't grow overnight, so even if you pay for tree planting now, it won't have any

00:09:33.324 --> 00:09:43.144
effect on your carbon footprint for many years and a tonne of carbon taken out of the sky today is

00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:48.774
worth much more than one taken out of the sky in five, ten or twenty years' time.

00:09:50.554 --> 00:09:59.134
Now, in fact, the majority of carbon offsetting programmes have switched to more short-term wins, to

00:09:59.134 --> 00:10:06.526
quicker wins, from things like investing in clean energy to distributing more efficient cooking

00:10:06.526 --> 00:10:07.246
stoves.

00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:15.296
So they switched to things where there is an immediate impact, and in many cases it's also a little

00:10:15.296 --> 00:10:16.346
bit more measurable.

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:24.377
But even with these, there's an additional problem, which is that it's often difficult to prove that

00:10:24.377 --> 00:10:31.427
the carbon offsetting schemes that have been put in place have actually had any positive impact or

00:10:31.427 --> 00:10:35.777
rather have had an impact that wouldn't have happened anyway.

00:10:36.848 --> 00:10:44.423
For example, if there is a scheme that encourages people in a certain area to switch to an energy

00:10:44.423 --> 00:10:51.143
efficient light bulb, how can you really know whether people in that area wouldn't have switched

00:10:51.143 --> 00:10:51.623
anyway?

00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:59.146
Yes, it's a good thing that they are using energy efficient light bulbs, but if they'd have made

00:10:59.146 --> 00:11:06.091
that switch anyway, then there's no point in paying to offset it if the behaviour would have

00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:07.471
happened in any case.

00:11:08.488 --> 00:11:15.144
It also encourages the local government in the places where these offset initiatives are taking

00:11:15.144 --> 00:11:22.950
place not to engage in any of these kinds of activities if it knows that these activities will be

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.560
done by others through carbon offsetting.

00:11:26.716 --> 00:11:33.810
There's also the other criticism, similar to the criticism that is leveled at lots of charitable

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.707
giving, which is you never know quite how efficient it is.

00:11:39.052 --> 00:11:47.136
If you are giving $20 to offset something through a clean cooking project in Botswana, you have no

00:11:47.136 --> 00:11:51.096
idea how efficient your carbon offsetting is.

00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:58.701
You'll never go there to check and there have been some bad operators in the carbon offsetting

00:11:58.701 --> 00:12:05.001
market that have sullied, that have damaged the reputation of the industry.

00:12:07.131 --> 00:12:14.271
These are, of course, all valid concerns and the carbon offsetting industry has stepped up to the

00:12:14.271 --> 00:12:21.431
mark and implemented some rigorous standards and accreditations for carbon offsetting programmes.

00:12:21.626 --> 00:12:24.815
A bit like fair trade or organic food.

00:12:25.616 --> 00:12:32.546
This has done a lot to clamp down on bad actors and has meant that, in theory at least, carbon

00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:39.461
offsetting should be more efficient, more transparent, and that more of the money goes towards

00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:46.578
projects that actually have a positive effect instead of either just going into someone's pocket or

00:12:46.878 --> 00:12:48.198
being wasted altogether.

00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:51.671
So what is the answer?

00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:59.036
Is carbon offsetting a good thing or is it just another way for people to pay to not think about

00:12:59.036 --> 00:13:04.106
their polluting activities and to not change their behaviour in the slightest?

00:13:06.146 --> 00:13:12.746
Well, it's of course not black and white and there isn't a one size fits all answer.

00:13:13.586 --> 00:13:20.096
If you are someone that is just paying to offset their carbon and not changing your behaviour in any

00:13:20.096 --> 00:13:26.906
way, or worse, if you think that carbon offsetting allows you to behave in a more polluting way

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:33.476
because you can just pay to offset it, then that's obviously not really a good thing at all.

00:13:34.136 --> 00:13:39.836
You can make the argument that it's slightly better than not offsetting anything, but it doesn't

00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:43.946
address the root cause, which is the need for behaviour change.

00:13:44.936 --> 00:13:53.126
But if you carbon offset as a part of a strategy to reduce your overall emissions and do that as

00:13:53.126 --> 00:13:58.826
well as changing some of your behaviour, then that inevitably has to be a good thing.

00:14:00.236 --> 00:14:05.696
On a personal level, I started offsetting my carbon emissions about a year ago.

00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:08.981
Money just comes out of my account every month.

00:14:09.401 --> 00:14:16.211
And yes, it does make me feel a little bit less bad about my own environmental impact, but it's also

00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:19.871
part of a wider effort that I am making to reduce my footprint.

00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:26.201
And if you are interested in this, there are loads of different services you can check out that will

00:14:26.201 --> 00:14:31.481
help you calculate your own carbon footprint and offset it if you choose.

00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:36.911
The one I use, which I definitely recommend is called project Wren.

00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:37.271
W.

00:14:37.271 --> 00:14:37.601
R.

00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:37.931
E.

00:14:37.931 --> 00:14:38.261
N.

00:14:38.806 --> 00:14:44.831
It's a site that allows you to give a bit of information about your lifestyle, then it will help you

00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:48.587
select projects that will help you offset your carbon footprint.

00:14:49.247 --> 00:14:53.147
It's a pretty cool one, and I'll leave a link in the show notes if you're interested.

00:14:54.341 --> 00:15:02.854
One final benefit that a lot of new carbon offsetting programmes have is what is called co-benefits

00:15:03.295 --> 00:15:09.984
meaning that carbon offsetting has an additional benefit over and above the carbon benefit.

00:15:10.614 --> 00:15:17.484
For example, providing employment in an area or providing an enlarged habitat for wildlife.

00:15:18.009 --> 00:15:24.159
So they are double wins, I guess, and with this, I think it's quite hard to argue.

00:15:25.569 --> 00:15:32.229
Okay then I hope that this has been an interesting dive into the world of carbon offsetting.

00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:36.009
As you now know, it's not that simple.

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:42.489
We've also only just touched the surface of carbon offsetting, and I hope you will excuse me for

00:15:42.499 --> 00:15:46.179
skimming over some other pretty important parts.

00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:52.631
As I said at the start of the podcast, if you are interested in becoming a member of Leonardo

00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:58.957
English and getting the transcripts and key vocabulary for this podcast and for every podcast with

00:15:58.957 --> 00:16:06.562
ever done and two new podcasts a week, then our promotional price of just nine euros per month is

00:16:06.562 --> 00:16:13.402
coming to an end at midnight on January the 31st so that's exactly a week from the day that this

00:16:13.402 --> 00:16:15.172
podcast is coming out.

00:16:15.862 --> 00:16:22.792
They can be the most amazing resource in terms of understanding every word in the podcast, and if

00:16:22.792 --> 00:16:27.772
you are using this as a real learning resource that it's definitely worth checking out.

00:16:28.687 --> 00:16:32.817
You can find out more at leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:16:33.907 --> 00:16:40.417
And finally on the subject of carbon offsetting, if you were thinking about jumping on a plane to an

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:46.717
English speaking country and taking a course and considering that against a membership of Leonardo

00:16:46.717 --> 00:16:52.617
English and learning through podcasts, handy transcripts and learning resources, then of course,

00:16:52.677 --> 00:16:58.197
becoming a member of Leonardo English and not taking the flight will not only save you a load of

00:16:58.197 --> 00:17:00.747
money, but be better for your carbon footprint.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:01.917
Okay.

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:05.847
I know that one might be a little bit tenuous, but you get my drift.

00:17:06.177 --> 00:17:07.557
I think we'll just end it there.

00:17:08.607 --> 00:17:13.857

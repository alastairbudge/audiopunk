Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:16.417
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:21.197
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.437 --> 00:00:27.627
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Penal Colonies,

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:33.027
when Britain put hundreds of thousands of criminals on ships and sent them

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:38.547
off to America and Australia for crimes as minor as stealing a loaf of bread.

00:00:39.717 --> 00:00:44.907
Before we get right into that though, I want to tell you about something I’m really excited about,

00:00:45.187 --> 00:00:51.217
and it’s a really cool new feature that’s just launched on the website, on leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:52.187 --> 00:00:56.397
As you may know, you can get the subtitles and transcripts for all of

00:00:56.397 --> 00:01:00.697
our episodes on the website, but what you can do now is hover over,

00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:06.367
or tap, on any of the harder words and immediately see what they mean.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:12.847
This makes following along with the audio even easier, it means you'll never miss a word,

00:01:13.127 --> 00:01:18.087
and will mean you’ll learn a load of new vocabulary that you wouldn’t have done otherwise.

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:24.527
It’s super exciting, so do go and check that out - the place to go is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:32.067
OK then, let’s get started and talk about penal colonies, and the system of

00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:36.557
sending criminals thousands of miles away, to the other side of the world.

00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:41.627
The system, or idea, of sending people who have committed

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:46.657
crimes away from society has existed throughout history.

00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:50.367
From a practical point of view, it makes sense.

00:01:50.907 --> 00:01:56.537
If someone has committed a crime and you don’t want them to do it again, you can either kill

00:01:56.537 --> 00:02:02.497
them, you execute them, or you put them somewhere that makes it harder to commit that crime again.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:08.097
That can either be in a prison or you can just send them away,

00:02:08.397 --> 00:02:11.957
so they physically can’t come back and commit another crime.

00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:18.477
We have evidence from the Ancient Romans that banishing citizens, that not

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:23.837
allowing them back into the city, was a common punishment for several crimes.

00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:30.037
Of course it doesn’t just serve the purpose of removing them from the city

00:02:30.407 --> 00:02:35.457
so they’re no longer a threat, it also acts as a deterrent to other people.

00:02:36.147 --> 00:02:40.362
If people know that they will be kicked out of a place for committing

00:02:40.647 --> 00:02:44.557
a crime then they should be less likely to commit that crime.

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:50.637
Until relatively recently, throughout Europe crime was met with pretty

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:55.847
harsh punishments, in order both to stop criminals from committing crimes

00:02:55.847 --> 00:03:00.387
again, and to deter others from committing them in the first place.

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:05.377
Up until the 18th century in Britain, a large proportion

00:03:05.377 --> 00:03:09.327
of crimes were punishable by death, by execution.

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:17.977
Indeed, in 1777 there were 222 crimes in Britain that were punishable by death,

00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:24.227
and they weren’t all what we could consider terrible, capital crimes today.

00:03:24.897 --> 00:03:30.347
In fact, most of them were some form of stealing, of theft.

00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:37.607
At the time if you stole anything worth over 5 shillings, which is today’s

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:43.857
equivalent of about €25, then you could be executed, you could be killed.

00:03:44.827 --> 00:03:49.677
If you cut down a tree, if you stole a horse, or even if you

00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:54.757
stole a rabbit, you could be executed, killed for your crimes.

00:03:56.017 --> 00:04:02.357
This has led to the law of this period, of the 17th and 18th centuries, being

00:04:02.357 --> 00:04:09.127
called the Bloody Code, because of quite how little you needed to do to be executed.

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:14.057
It was also during this period that Britain had experienced

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:17.857
the Agricultural and then Industrial Revolutions.

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:25.187
Agricultural workers were being replaced by machines and better farming techniques, and

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:31.657
they were flocking to the city in droves, they were moving to the city in large numbers.

00:04:32.967 --> 00:04:38.377
But cities in 17th and 18th century England were pretty horrible places.

00:04:39.047 --> 00:04:46.647
Living conditions were terrible, wages were very low, diseases spread quickly, there was a gin

00:04:46.707 --> 00:04:54.897
epidemic going on, and many people were reduced to stealing just to have enough food to survive.

00:04:56.097 --> 00:05:01.507
Crime rates increased dramatically, despite this Bloody Code that was

00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:06.677
intended to act as a deterrent, to frighten people into not stealing.

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:12.297
But when you have an empty stomach and the alternative is

00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:16.287
starving to death, I guess that really isn’t much of a choice.

00:05:17.077 --> 00:05:21.537
The prisons that did exist filled up, and the British government

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:27.557
started to use warships, large boats, as huge floating prisons.

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:34.407
These were normally old ships that were no longer in active military service,

00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:41.187
and they were kept just off-land, filled with prisoners in terrible conditions.

00:05:42.447 --> 00:05:51.137
Indeed, diseases such as cholera were rife on these ships, and prisoners died in large amounts.

00:05:52.287 --> 00:05:56.367
Although you might not be sentenced to death, being sent to

00:05:56.367 --> 00:06:00.217
one of these prison ships was a death sentence for many people.

00:06:01.547 --> 00:06:08.357
The ships were full, the prisons were full, and there was a growing movement from philosophers

00:06:08.387 --> 00:06:17.207
and public figures that just executing people for such small crimes as theft was morally wrong.

00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:22.637
But some punishment was required, otherwise there would be no deterrent.

00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:25.687
You couldn’t just let people off their crimes.

00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:27.357
Crime rates would go up.

00:06:27.557 --> 00:06:29.547
So something needed to be done.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:38.097
The solution was what was called ‘transportation’, being sent in a ship far, far away.

00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:44.647
To begin with, criminals were sent to America, to the 13 colonies on

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:49.127
the east coast of what is now the United States of America and Canada.

00:06:50.507 --> 00:06:53.537
This started actually in the 1610s.

00:06:54.197 --> 00:06:59.107
For crimes as small as stealing a loaf of bread you might be sentenced

00:06:59.327 --> 00:07:05.817
to be put on a ship and sent off to America for either 7 or 14 years.

00:07:07.097 --> 00:07:12.767
The ships were, as you might imagine, horrible, rat-infested vessels.

00:07:13.547 --> 00:07:17.837
If you did manage to survive the journey, you would in effect

00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:22.187
be sold to a plantation owner in one of the new colonies.

00:07:23.377 --> 00:07:30.817
The working conditions when you got there were often terrible, it was forced labour for 10 hours

00:07:30.817 --> 00:07:38.657
a day, often alongside, and under exactly the same conditions, as the slaves on the plantations.

00:07:39.657 --> 00:07:47.207
And even if you did manage to survive your 7 or 14 years, there was no free ticket back home.

00:07:48.457 --> 00:07:54.827
You would have to pay for a ticket back to Britain, and given that these prisoners had been working

00:07:55.007 --> 00:08:01.297
as unpaid labourers for the duration of their time there, they had no money and no way to go home.

00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:09.567
They might find a job in the new colony, as a jailer, or working as a servant, but it was

00:08:09.567 --> 00:08:14.747
very rare that they would ever be able to earn enough money for a ticket back to Britain.

00:08:15.657 --> 00:08:18.637
So in effect you were sent away for life.

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:27.457
It’s thought that anywhere between 60,000 and 120,000 prisoners were sent from Britain

00:08:27.627 --> 00:08:34.527
to America, which is up to 10% of the total migrants to America during that time.

00:08:35.837 --> 00:08:42.172
Now, part of the American founding story is that the founding fathers left

00:08:42.172 --> 00:08:48.592
Europe because they went in search for a better land, a home of the free, but

00:08:48.732 --> 00:08:54.432
the reality is that quite a large number of the early settlers were actually

00:08:54.752 --> 00:08:59.292
criminals, even if the crimes they might have committed were pretty minor.

00:09:00.482 --> 00:09:05.122
This is something you certainly won’t find taught in many American high school classes.

00:09:06.462 --> 00:09:12.252
This continued until the American Revolution in 1776, when of course

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:17.112
the Americans weren’t so keen on Britain using their newly independent

00:09:17.112 --> 00:09:21.712
country as an open jail, a place to house British prisoners.

00:09:22.772 --> 00:09:25.812
So Britain needed to find somewhere else.

00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:35.902
It just so happened that 6 years earlier, in 1770, Captain James Cook had sailed from Plymouth,

00:09:36.212 --> 00:09:42.612
in the south west of England, all the way down the Atlantic, past the bottom of South America,

00:09:43.162 --> 00:09:49.982
around New Zealand, and then ‘discovered’ or rather he was the first known European to

00:09:49.982 --> 00:09:57.412
discover, Australia, which he claimed as a British colony, on behalf of the king, George III.

00:09:58.642 --> 00:10:02.502
It was decided that this new colony, on the other side of the

00:10:02.502 --> 00:10:07.112
world, was to be the next destination for British criminals.

00:10:08.682 --> 00:10:14.672
Indeed, one of the differences between how Britain viewed Australia and how it viewed

00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:21.512
America was that sending convicts to America was only a small part of its American policy.

00:10:22.302 --> 00:10:28.652
With Australia, it was to be a penal colony, an island for prisoners, with convicts

00:10:28.842 --> 00:10:35.122
being an instrumental part of the British plan to colonise and populate the island.

00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:41.452
So, Australia was to be the new America, the new destination for convicts,

00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:50.352
and on the 13th of May 1787 the first ships set sail for Australia, arriving

00:10:50.382 --> 00:10:55.892
8 months later with 10% of the convicts on board dying during the journey.

00:10:57.062 --> 00:11:03.172
10% actually turned out to be quite a good result - during later voyages up

00:11:03.172 --> 00:11:08.562
to 30% of the passengers, the convicts on board, would die during the trip.

00:11:10.142 --> 00:11:18.362
Of course, Australia is even further away from Britain than America, and if in America it

00:11:18.362 --> 00:11:25.072
was just very very hard to go back to Britain, from Australia there really was no going back.

00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:29.182
Conditions were just as harsh when you got there.

00:11:29.732 --> 00:11:33.792
The prisoners were set to work building new settlements.

00:11:34.072 --> 00:11:40.192
They were fiercely punished for any misbehaviour, and it was a cruel and hard life.

00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:50.392
Between the first voyage in 1787 and when the last convicts arrived in 1868 it’s thought that

00:11:50.402 --> 00:11:58.312
more than 160,000 convicts, 160,000 prisoners, were transported from Britain to Australia.

00:11:59.682 --> 00:12:06.212
Indeed, now one in five Australians is the descendant of a convict, which

00:12:06.372 --> 00:12:10.692
is the subject of lots of rude jokes that Brits make about Australians.

00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:15.492
Of course, Britain wasn’t the only country to have sent

00:12:15.492 --> 00:12:19.662
its prisoners off on boats or trains to far away lands.

00:12:20.312 --> 00:12:23.982
Other countries did it, and some, sadly, still do it.

00:12:24.972 --> 00:12:31.232
France used the notoriously awful Devil’s Island, an island off French Guiana.

00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:35.542
If you’ve seen the cult film Papillon, that’s where that took place.

00:12:36.442 --> 00:12:41.674
Devil’s Island was also where Alfred Dreyfus was sent, the army officer

00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:46.231
wrongly convicted of treason, which triggered The Dreyfus Affair.

00:12:47.401 --> 00:12:53.431
The Soviet Union transported millions of citizens from the West of the country to Siberia

00:12:53.801 --> 00:12:58.771
and the Central Asian states, places like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan.

00:13:00.421 --> 00:13:05.351
These were mainly so called political prisoners, who were sent far away

00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:09.321
to be out of the way and not cause trouble in the west of the country,

00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:15.041
but also to start settlements in underpopulated areas of the Soviet Union.

00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:18.831
If you want to learn more about that then you should check

00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:22.801
out the episode on the Aral Sea, the sea that disappeared.

00:13:23.931 --> 00:13:26.501
And North Korea still does it.

00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:31.061
Granted, it’s not sending prisoners off to the other side of the

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:36.561
world because, well, it can’t, but it’s still sending unwanted actors

00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:41.111
far away to the other side of the country to work in labour camps.

00:13:42.111 --> 00:13:45.541
Britain started to stop sending prisoners to Australia in

00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:51.111
the 1850s, and the last British prisoners arrived in 1868.

00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:59.471
It ended over 150 years ago, but British culture and history is peppered with

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:05.361
examples of people who were either sent to Australia, or who narrowly avoided it.

00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:10.291
If you’ve listened to the episode on the history of Harrods, the

00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:14.421
famous department store, you’ll remember that the founder of Harrods

00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:19.531
narrowly escaped being sent to Australia for handling stolen goods.

00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:25.011
And perhaps the most well-known example of someone being sent

00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:29.721
to Australia is in the Dickens novel, Great Expectations.

00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:37.031
Pip, the small boy who helps a man at the opening of the book later discovers that

00:14:37.041 --> 00:14:43.001
this man, Magwitch, was a convict sent to Australia, who ends up making a lot of money,

00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:49.091
secretly sending it to Pip, and later returning to see what a man Pip had turned out to be.

00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:55.051
So, penal colonies, and the idea of sending prisoners to the other side of the

00:14:55.051 --> 00:15:01.541
world has left a lasting mark on the culture and history of Britain, on Australia,

00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:07.141
and even, although they wouldn’t like to admit it, on The United States of America.

00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:13.271
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Penal Colonies,

00:15:13.321 --> 00:15:16.211
on sending prisoners to the other side of the world.

00:15:16.871 --> 00:15:21.941
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that when someone says something rude like ‘Australia

00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:26.751
is full of criminals’, then you'll know a little bit more about the history behind that.

00:15:27.691 --> 00:15:31.791
As a quick, final reminder, if you are looking to improve your English in a

00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:35.811
more interesting way, to join a community of curious minds from all over the

00:15:35.811 --> 00:15:40.611
world, and to unlock the transcripts, subtitles, and key vocabulary, then

00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:44.901
I’d definitely recommend checking out becoming a member of Leonardo English.

00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:50.651
We’ve just launched that super cool new feature that means you can hover over the words and discover

00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:55.821
their meaning right as you listen, so that’s well worth a look, if you haven’t done so already.

00:15:56.272 --> 00:15:58.822
The place to go is Leonardo english.com

00:15:59.724 --> 00:16:04.604
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English

00:16:05.104 --> 00:16:09.954
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

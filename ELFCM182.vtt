Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:16.813
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:21.173
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:28.273
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the crazy life of John McAfee.

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:33.813
Now, you might not have heard of John McAfee until recently, or at all.

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:39.553
But if you have ever used a Windows computer, you have probably used a programme he created.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:45.403
McAfee Antivirus Software, the programme that promises to protect your

00:00:45.403 --> 00:00:50.683
computer against all sorts of harmful viruses and threats, and keep you safe.

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:57.353
And if you knew nothing about the life of the man behind the software, you might think that he

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:04.643
could have been a quiet computer programmer working away in an office, living an unremarkable life.

00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:07.833
Nothing could be farther from the truth.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:15.723
Our story will involve computer viruses, guns, the FBI, drugs, Central American

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:22.253
gangsters, murder, cryptocurrency, prostitution, tax evasion, sex, and suicide.

00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:27.993
By the end of today’s episode I think you’ll agree that there are many words one could

00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:34.413
use to describe the life of John McAfee, but boring and uneventful are not among them.

00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:39.783
Before we get right into our story, I want to remind you that you can become a

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:44.643

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:30.163
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:35.513
Ok then, the crazy life of John McAfee.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:41.393
It seems strange to start a story at its end, but for John McAfee,

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:47.557
his story ended a month and a half ago, on the 23rd June of 2021.

00:02:48.293 --> 00:02:55.023
He was being held in a Spanish jail cell, awaiting extradition to the United States, he

00:02:55.023 --> 00:03:01.803
was about to be sent back to America to face charges of tax evasion, of not paying taxes.

00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:09.513
At around 6pm, the guards went to his prison cell, and found him dead, it appeared that

00:03:09.513 --> 00:03:15.433
he had hung himself a few months before he was going to celebrate his 76th birthday.

00:03:16.153 --> 00:03:20.673
To try to understand how and why McAfee was in this situation,

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:24.183
we need to go all the way back to the start of his life.

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:29.963
He was born in England in 1945, a month after the Japanese

00:03:30.073 --> 00:03:33.153
had surrendered and World War II was officially over.

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:38.573
His father was an American airman, who had been stationed in England.

00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:40.233
His mother was English.

00:03:40.893 --> 00:03:44.453
The family moved back to America, and McAfee grew up

00:03:44.463 --> 00:03:47.823
in Virginia, on the Eastern side of the United States.

00:03:48.843 --> 00:03:52.913
His childhood was, he reported, an unhappy one, as his

00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:57.303
father was a terrible alcoholic who beat him and his mother.

00:03:58.013 --> 00:04:03.883
Tragically, his father shot himself when the young McAfee was only 15 years old.

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:12.363
Understandably, this tragic event left a permanent scar on McAfee, and he said later in an interview

00:04:12.863 --> 00:04:20.083
"Every relationship I have, he's by my side; every mistrust, he is the negotiator of that mistrust."

00:04:21.073 --> 00:04:26.023
McAfee was a talented mathematician, and started working on a PhD.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:33.243
He managed to progress academically despite starting to drink heavily and experiment with drugs.

00:04:33.903 --> 00:04:40.953
But it was to be another vice that was to curtail, to stop short, his academic career.

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:47.973
It was discovered that he had been sleeping with an undergraduate student that he was supposed to

00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:54.323
be mentoring, that he was supposed to be looking after, and he was kicked out of his PhD programme.

00:04:55.415 --> 00:05:01.203
This undergraduate student was to become the first of his three wives, but you will

00:05:01.213 --> 00:05:06.743
see that sexual appetite will be a theme throughout the life of this eccentric man.

00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:12.453
After being kicked out of his PhD programme, he found work doing various

00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:17.443
different computer programming jobs, but the drink and the drugs didn’t stop.

00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:23.513
In fact, they only got worse, and by the early 80s he was reportedly

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:28.283
drinking a bottle of whisky a day and taking cocaine at his desk.

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:34.543
This was all while having a series of pretty high-powered technology jobs.

00:05:35.463 --> 00:05:40.543
McAfee would later report that this wasn't abnormal in the world he was living in.

00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:44.823
People who were working in technology were also keen on personal

00:05:44.853 --> 00:05:49.893
experimentation, and altering your senses was one way of doing this.

00:05:50.793 --> 00:05:56.433
Nevertheless, by 1984 McAfee realised that he had to stop, and

00:05:56.673 --> 00:06:01.353
that was reportedly the last time he ever used drink or drugs.

00:06:02.343 --> 00:06:07.993
His hellraiser lifestyle, his crazy lifestyle, had cost him dearly in

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:13.293
terms of personal relationships, and he was becoming increasingly paranoid.

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:21.403
But this paranoia was to turn into an incredibly useful, and profitable, tool for McAfee.

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:28.713
The 1980s was a time when personal computers started entering American homes for the first time.

00:06:29.533 --> 00:06:36.073
They had previously been magical, mysterious objects used by scientists and big organisations.

00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:39.063
Now, you could have one in your home.

00:06:39.963 --> 00:06:44.083
With the arrival of the first personal computers came the first

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:49.013
computer virus, which was programmed by a pair of brothers in Pakistan.

00:06:50.143 --> 00:06:55.153
These brothers didn’t really know what impact the virus might have, and they

00:06:55.153 --> 00:06:59.793
didn’t try to hide the fact that they were behind it - indeed, they left their

00:06:59.843 --> 00:07:04.693
address and their phone number on the message that infected computers received!

00:07:05.543 --> 00:07:11.453
McAfee, being a skillful programmer, created software that could stop this virus.

00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:16.673
His idea was that he could give the software away for free, so

00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:20.183
that people could protect their own computers against the virus.

00:07:20.603 --> 00:07:26.313
McAfee thought companies would also want it to protect their computers, and they

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:31.153
would be prepared to pay for it, they just needed to know that they needed it.

00:07:32.353 --> 00:07:35.833
After having created this software, McAfee needed to

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:38.796
make people believe that they weren’t safe without it.

00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:44.853
If you didn’t know what a computer virus was, you first needed to be educated

00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:49.093
about them before you would feel the need to install McAfee’s software.

00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:55.733
McAfee used all sorts of stunts, all sorts of tricks, to warn people of this huge

00:07:55.853 --> 00:08:02.223
threat from computer viruses, from going around the country in a camper truck loaded

00:08:02.243 --> 00:08:08.953
with computers that he called an “antivirus paramedic unit” to frequent TV appearances

00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:14.853
where he would describe this huge threat that was just waiting to invade your computer.

00:08:16.043 --> 00:08:18.863
McAfee’s marketing efforts worked.

00:08:19.283 --> 00:08:22.893
Big companies immediately bought it, and it was quickly

00:08:22.893 --> 00:08:27.163
seen as a must-have to protect computers against viruses.

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:33.989
By 1990 McAfee was making $5 million a year, and by

00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:40.203
1993 he controlled 67% of the desktop antivirus market.

00:08:40.983 --> 00:08:45.773
If you have ever bought McAfee Antivirus software, or your computer had

00:08:45.773 --> 00:08:50.173
it pre-loaded onto it, this is where the original version came from.

00:08:50.943 --> 00:08:54.983
And this, evidently, made John McAfee a very rich man.

00:08:55.883 --> 00:09:02.973
He sold his shares in the company in 1993, and walked away with around $80 million.

00:09:05.173 --> 00:09:10.773
But while others in a similar situation might have simply retired and enjoyed

00:09:10.803 --> 00:09:15.943
their millions quietly, John McAfee’s life was about to get a lot crazier.

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:23.973
His fame as the world’s most famous cyber security expert had made him a target for hackers,

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:30.803
and it would be a great badge of honour for a hacker to be able to hack John McAfee.

00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:38.183
This made him probably even more paranoid, and for the rest of his life he would

00:09:38.193 --> 00:09:44.073
be constantly watching his back, swapping SIM cards, changing IP addresses, using

00:09:44.073 --> 00:09:49.333
fake names to buy computers and phones, and forever looking over his shoulder.

00:09:50.243 --> 00:09:55.453
He continued to invest in security-related companies and real estate, but

00:09:55.643 --> 00:10:02.478
when the 2007 financial crisis came he reported that he lost almost all of

00:10:02.603 --> 00:10:08.493
his money, going from a fortune of around $100 million to just $4 million.

00:10:09.973 --> 00:10:16.113
And it was after the financial crisis that things started to reach new levels of crazy.

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:24.453
He moved to Belize, the tiny Central American country between Mexico and Guatemala, in 2008.

00:10:24.913 --> 00:10:29.433
He bought up a large plot of land, but claimed that he was being

00:10:29.613 --> 00:10:34.203
extorted by the Belizean government and a local drug cartel.

00:10:34.873 --> 00:10:41.543
He started to build up a mini army, and hired dozens of private security guards to protect him.

00:10:42.043 --> 00:10:46.233
They would all be heavily armed, and there are photos of McAfee from

00:10:46.233 --> 00:10:50.693
his early years in Belize surrounded by people with machine guns.

00:10:51.653 --> 00:10:58.763
By this time he had two failed marriages behind him, and in Belize he seemed to

00:10:58.783 --> 00:11:04.123
be surrounded by a large number, one could even say a “bevvy”, of young women.

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:10.823
He continued to build new houses on his land, and before long his compound

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:16.073
was a vast collection of different properties, many of them just lying empty.

00:11:16.853 --> 00:11:22.903
Partly for company, and partly to guard the property, McAfee kept 11

00:11:22.903 --> 00:11:28.373
dogs, who were semi-wild and would reportedly make a lot of noise.

00:11:28.913 --> 00:11:34.243
This evidently didn’t go down very well with his neighbours, and it annoyed one neighbour in

00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:41.283
particular: a man named George Faull, another American who spent part of the year living in Belize.

00:11:42.043 --> 00:11:47.943
The story goes that Faull had complained to McAfee multiple times, but nothing happened.

00:11:48.873 --> 00:11:53.853
One day, four of McAfee’s dogs were found dead, poisoned.

00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:59.033
A week later, George Faull, the American neighbour, was found in a

00:11:59.063 --> 00:12:04.563
pool of blood with a hole through his head, as if he had been executed.

00:12:05.563 --> 00:12:10.183
The Belize police swooped in to question McAfee, who had made

00:12:10.183 --> 00:12:13.833
no secret of the fact that he hated his American neighbour.

00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:19.603
But before they could get to him, McAfee fled, he escaped from

00:12:19.603 --> 00:12:23.073
the police, and managed to get into Guatemala, to the north.

00:12:23.983 --> 00:12:29.323
According to McAfee, he had done nothing wrong, but believed that the Belizean

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:34.003
government was deeply corrupt and he didn’t trust his chances with them.

00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:39.433
It should be said that McAfee denies having had anything to do with the

00:12:39.443 --> 00:12:44.513
murder of George Faull, and nobody has actually been charged for it.

00:12:45.523 --> 00:12:50.803
After having made it to Guatemala, McAfee was held by the police on charges of

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:56.543
having entered the country illegally, and he was about to be sent back to Belize.

00:12:57.353 --> 00:13:01.923
While being held in Guatemala, it was reported that he had two

00:13:01.943 --> 00:13:06.543
small heart attacks in prison, and so his deportation was delayed.

00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:12.173
As a result, there was time for his lawyers to contest the charges,

00:13:12.563 --> 00:13:16.853
and he was sent back to the United States, not back to Belize.

00:13:17.803 --> 00:13:22.213
McAfee would later state that he actually faked these heart attacks.

00:13:22.863 --> 00:13:28.883
Whether he did or not we will never know, but they certainly meant that the next chapter of

00:13:28.883 --> 00:13:35.793
his life would start as a free man back in the United States, not in a Belizean jail cell.

00:13:36.743 --> 00:13:40.523
Back in the United States, he became even more paranoid.

00:13:41.223 --> 00:13:46.323
He believed that he was being chased by Belizean drug gangs with links to the government,

00:13:46.563 --> 00:13:52.403
and he would travel around the country staying only in motels under anonymous names.

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:58.853
He remarried in 2013, to a lady called Janice Dyson.

00:13:59.643 --> 00:14:03.783
They had met on his first night back in the United States in Florida.

00:14:04.363 --> 00:14:07.913
He was sitting in a bar, she was working as a prostitute.

00:14:08.543 --> 00:14:12.303
She solicited him, and they quickly fell in love, and

00:14:12.483 --> 00:14:15.683
she remained by his side for the rest of his life.

00:14:16.653 --> 00:14:21.443
While travelling around the United States, he would carry around lots of different

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:27.083
mobile phones, and do things like jump out of his car and attach a mobile phone

00:14:27.113 --> 00:14:32.453
to another, random car, supposedly to confuse the people who were following him.

00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:39.529
During this time he also went on a personal war against McAfee Antivirus Software,

00:14:39.899 --> 00:14:45.780
even releasing a parody video called “How to uninstall McAfee Antivirus”.

00:14:46.409 --> 00:14:49.919
He had sold all of his shares almost 20 years

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:53.359
beforehand, and had no links to the company whatsoever.

00:14:54.329 --> 00:15:00.349
He also became even more of a campaigner for internet security, and for privacy.

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:06.599
There are countless videos of him talking about the risks posed by things like mobile

00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:12.369
phones, and talking about the measures that he takes to protect his own security.

00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:18.919
In 2016, he had his first attempt at running for US president.

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:24.469
You might have thought that for a man trying to hide, running for President

00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:29.659
of the United States wasn’t a great idea, but McAfee went ahead anyway.

00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:35.409
He put himself forward as a candidate for the Libertarian party, advocating

00:15:35.409 --> 00:15:40.949
to end the war on drugs and increase cybersecurity against Russia and China.

00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:46.839
He didn’t win the nomination, but it wouldn’t be his only bid for President.

00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:54.289
He tried again in 2020, with a similar agenda, but again, didn’t get very far.

00:15:55.129 --> 00:16:01.239
Not content with a peaceful life with his new wife, he threw himself into new technological

00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:06.819
developments, and started and invested in several new cybersecurity companies.

00:16:07.559 --> 00:16:14.179
He also became a vocal proponent of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and it was

00:16:14.219 --> 00:16:20.579
actually this element of his life that was to lead him to wind up in a Spanish jail cell.

00:16:21.229 --> 00:16:25.629
McAfee, as you have probably gathered by now, was a Libertarian.

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:33.129
He was anti-government, anti controls on personal liberty, and an advocate of personal choice.

00:16:33.739 --> 00:16:38.389
Many people with these kinds of beliefs naturally gravitated

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:42.389
towards cryptocurrency, given its decentralised nature.

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:51.049
McAfee also believed that tax was theft, and he hadn’t filed his US taxes since 2010.

00:16:52.319 --> 00:16:56.559
As you may know, the US is one of the few countries in the world

00:16:56.739 --> 00:17:01.409
where citizens have to pay taxes in the US no matter where they live.

00:17:02.139 --> 00:17:08.709
So, McAfee was soon a target for the IRS, the Inland Revenue Service, the government

00:17:08.739 --> 00:17:15.059
organisation responsible for collecting taxes in the US, as well as for the FBI.

00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:21.409
In January of 2019 McAfee announced that he was officially being chased by

00:17:21.409 --> 00:17:26.539
the IRS, and as a consequence, he was on the run from the US government.

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:33.729
He believed that the US government wanted to make an example out of him, and if he was

00:17:33.729 --> 00:17:40.109
tried in a US court then he would spend the rest of his life behind bars, in prison.

00:17:41.069 --> 00:17:46.809
In October of 2020, while in Spain, McAfee was arrested by the Spanish police.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:53.249
He was being sought by the IRS on charges of tax evasion, after he had

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:59.699
reportedly made millions by promoting cryptocurrencies between 2014 and 2018.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:06.749
From October of 2020 to June of 2021, McAfee and his legal team fought

00:18:06.879 --> 00:18:12.039
the extradition order, they fought to avoid him being sent back to the US.

00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:16.259
While he was in prison, McAfee continued to communicate

00:18:16.389 --> 00:18:19.609
with the outside world, sending tweets such as:

00:18:20.169 --> 00:18:21.489
I am content in here.

00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:22.559
I have friends.

00:18:22.929 --> 00:18:23.819
The food is good.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.069
All is well.

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:30.989
Know that if I hang myself, a la Epstein, it will be no fault of mine.

00:18:32.109 --> 00:18:34.398
That was in October of 2020.

00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:40.339
Then, in June of 2021, the extradition order was approved.

00:18:41.299 --> 00:18:44.589
McAfee was scheduled to be sent back to the US, and

00:18:44.899 --> 00:18:48.629
hours later he was found dead, apparently by suicide.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:54.539
Now, since his death there have been dozens of conspiracy theories about this.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:19:00.719
From theories that he isn’t actually dead, and that he faked his own death, through to

00:19:00.924 --> 00:19:06.614
theories that he was murdered, that Latin American gangsters finally managed to get to him.

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:12.364
The official verdict was suicide, although this is still disputed by

00:19:12.364 --> 00:19:17.164
his wife, who says that she spoke to him days before and he seemed

00:19:17.214 --> 00:19:21.374
very happy, not the sort of man who would have taken his own life.

00:19:22.474 --> 00:19:25.984
This isn’t the time or place for a lot of speculation,

00:19:26.004 --> 00:19:28.954
but let’s just look at both sides for a minute.

00:19:30.154 --> 00:19:33.734
He was forever tricking people, playing tricks on the

00:19:33.734 --> 00:19:37.154
public, and making people believe things that weren’t true.

00:19:37.804 --> 00:19:43.104
He was also someone who had spent the majority of his adult life fighting authority,

00:19:43.114 --> 00:19:48.764
in different forms, and not the sort of person who seemed to give up lightly.

00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:53.114
Plus, according to his wife and lawyer, he was not suicidal at all.

00:19:53.964 --> 00:20:00.334
So, on that basis, the fact that he killed himself does seem a little out of character.

00:20:00.944 --> 00:20:05.544
But, on the other hand, he was 75 years old, he had lived

00:20:05.694 --> 00:20:09.824
an incredibly stressful life of adventure and tragedy.

00:20:10.454 --> 00:20:14.564
He had just found out that he was about to be sent back to a place

00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:18.454
where he believed he would spend the rest of his life in prison.

00:20:19.314 --> 00:20:23.868
Is it so unbelievable that he might have decided to end it all?

00:20:24.474 --> 00:20:29.194
He would no doubt have known that his fans wouldn’t believe that he killed himself,

00:20:29.534 --> 00:20:35.394
and was this last act his way of leaving one last conspiracy for people to believe?

00:20:36.494 --> 00:20:39.684
In all probability, we will never know for sure, but

00:20:39.784 --> 00:20:43.744
perhaps that is exactly what John McAfee would have wanted.

00:20:46.843 --> 00:20:52.673
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the eccentric life of John McAfee.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:58.703
He was a security pioneer, a brilliant computer scientist, and a wildly successful businessman.

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:03.233
But, he was also deeply troubled and self-destructive.

00:21:03.903 --> 00:21:06.873
In his own words, he was “not normal”.

00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:12.063
And whether you think that John McAfee was a mad, dangerous, criminal, or

00:21:12.223 --> 00:21:16.473
whether he was in fact someone who died a martyr in the fight against a

00:21:16.473 --> 00:21:21.733
corrupt system, it is hard to deny that he lived a weird but fascinating life.

00:21:22.563 --> 00:21:28.153
And if you have McAfee Anti Virus software on your computer then the next time

00:21:28.283 --> 00:21:33.493
you get one of those annoying notifications asking you to scan your computer, you

00:21:33.493 --> 00:21:37.803
will know a little bit more about the man who gave his name to that programme.

00:21:38.823 --> 00:21:42.363

Are you more on the side of him being a dangerous, unstable man, or an unfortunate victim?

00:21:53.423 --> 00:21:54.683

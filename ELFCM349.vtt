Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.730
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.790
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.720
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.209
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.309
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:20.490
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.580
I'm Alastair Budge, and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.450
today we are talking about

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.839
something a little different.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.729
Today we’ll take a look at six of the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.289
most unusual street names in London.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.089
Some of them are steeped in history,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.059
while others make absolutely no

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.820
sense at all or have more than one

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.040
supposed origin, or explanation.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.180
There are literary connections,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.620
murder mysteries and legends.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.290
And in fact, for good measure, we’re

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.249
going to include a couple more from

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.450
outside the M25, from further afield,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.750
outside London, because there is

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.629
indeed life outside the capital.

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:01.785
OK then, let’s get into it and talk

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.675
about some of the most unusual street

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:06.396
names in London, and indeed in Britain.

00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:10.755
Now, before we start, it’s worth spending

00:01:10.765 --> 00:01:13.525
just a minute thinking about, reminding

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:15.985
ourselves perhaps, about how streets

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:17.675
get their names in the first place.

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:19.861
Typically they’re named after

00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.781
places, after kings and queens or

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:25.111
people of historical importance.

00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:28.441
Avenue Victor Hugo, Potsdamer

00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.551
Platz, Via Dante, Beijing Lu.

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:34.012
And the UK is no exception.

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:36.512
Most streets are named after

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.682
places, attractions, or people.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.582
And to illustrate this in statistical

00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:44.812
terms, the most popular street names

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:47.792
in the UK are, in this order, High

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:50.612
Street, Station Road, Main Street,

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:53.062
Park Road, and then Church Road.

00:01:53.552 --> 00:01:55.722
And it goes on - Oxford Road,

00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:58.542
London Road, Hill Road, King’s

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.042
Street, you get the picture.

00:02:00.822 --> 00:02:02.862
None of these street names have

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:05.072
particularly interesting stories,

00:02:05.262 --> 00:02:07.622
but there are plenty of streets that

00:02:07.632 --> 00:02:10.672
do, and many of them can be found

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:13.092
within a very small area of London.

00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:16.532
So, without further ado, the first

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.752
unusual street name on our list is

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.942
Frying Pan Alley, in London’s East End.

00:02:23.312 --> 00:02:25.922
Frying Pan Alley is actually in a narrow

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:28.812
alleyway in Spitalfields, an area of

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:31.272
east London known for its famous market.

00:02:31.972 --> 00:02:33.942
And an alleyway is a narrow

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:36.122
street or passage that runs

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.642
between or behind buildings.

00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:41.682
So, how did Frying Pan Alley get its name?

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:44.537
Well, you can probably guess part of it.

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:47.575
It's thought to come from ironmongers

00:02:47.782 --> 00:02:49.712
that used to have shops in the alley

00:02:49.922 --> 00:02:52.022
and would hang their frying pans

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:53.932
in the window or above the door

00:02:54.172 --> 00:02:56.082
to attract potential customers.

00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.432
On a quick language note, an ironmonger

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.002
is someone who sells housing and gardening

00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:05.137
equipment, usually made from metal.

00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:07.707
And originally it meant someone

00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:09.557
who sells things made of iron.

00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:12.727
And if you find any word in English

00:03:12.887 --> 00:03:15.567
that ends in “monger”, it means

00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:17.887
someone who sells that thing - a

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:20.577
fishmonger sells fish, for example.

00:03:20.947 --> 00:03:23.617
And it can even be used metaphorically,

00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:27.157
for ideas, for example - a scaremonger

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.529
is someone who sells, or spreads,

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.619
scary stories, and a hatemonger is

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.119
someone who spreads hate, especially

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:36.669
towards one group of people.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.849
But we’re getting distracted, let

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.799
me get back to Frying Pan Alley,

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.649
because there is more to it.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.889
The legend goes that one of these frying

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.849
pan signs fell on someone walking down the

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:52.748
alley, and shoppers then started walking

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:54.769
on the other side of the street, causing

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.959
the locals to call it Frying Pan Alley.

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:00.189
Nowadays Frying Pan Alley is

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.639
surrounded by modernist, glass

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.309
fronted buildings and businesses,

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.829
it’s in a really fancy area of London.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.569
But this is a relatively

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:10.599
modern phenomenon.

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:13.819
Even in the early 20th century it was

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:16.389
in one of the poorest areas of the city.

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:18.899
You can actually read about this

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.009
specific street in the works of the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:23.189
famous American writer Jack London.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:26.249
He wrote a book called “The People of

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.849
the Abyss”, which described the squalid,

00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:31.629
dirty or filthy, East End of London

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.589
that he saw when he visited in 1902.

00:04:35.684 --> 00:04:38.089
In it, he described, and I’m

00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:40.179
quoting directly, “we cut off

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:42.153
to the left into Spitalfields,

00:04:42.153 --> 00:04:43.909
and dived into Frying Pan Alley.

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:46.589
A swarm of children cluttered

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.969
the slimy pavement, for all the

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:51.139
world like tadpoles just turned

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.869
frogs on the bottom of a dry pond.

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:55.999
In a narrow doorway… sat a woman

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.369
with a young babe, nursing at her

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.239
breasts grossly naked and libelling

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:03.339
all the sacredness of motherhood.”

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.949
If you go there today you’ll see

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:09.919
lawyers and bankers, but, as you just

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.209
heard, not much more than 100 years

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:14.769
ago it was a very different place.

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:18.969
Now, next on our list of unusual street

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:21.909
names is Wardrobe Place, down in the

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.199
City of London, London’s financial

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.729
district, close to the Tower of London.

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.179
A wardrobe, I’m sure you know, is the

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.689
place where you keep your clothes,

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.429
and it’s normally kept in the bedroom.

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.439
So, why would a street be

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:39.999
called “Wardrobe Place”?

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.019
Who kept their wardrobe outside, or who

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.129
had a wardrobe so large and important that

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.659
an entire street would be named after it?

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.659
Well, the owner of the wardrobe in

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.479
question was King Edward I of England,

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:56.789
who ruled in the 13th century.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.469
And “wardrobe”, when referring to a

00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:03.029
king or queen, was something slightly

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:06.299
more grand than a simple IKEA cupboard

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:08.249
that you or I might keep our clothes in.

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:12.059
Technically speaking it wasn’t literally

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.669
a wardrobe but rather the ‘King’s

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:16.879
Wardrobe’, as it was known, or if

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.799
we translate it into plain English,

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.179
we could say “all the King’s stuff”.

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:24.589
The King’s Wardrobe is thought to have

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.929
contained something called the ‘Privy

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.859
Wardrobe’, which kept armour and weapons

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:31.909
made at the Tower of London, and the

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:33.899
Great Wardrobe, which was where they

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:36.349
kept King Edward’s clothes and jewellery.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:40.059
But in time it also became the home of

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.729
coins and other valuables, important

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.179
royal documents, fur, as well as

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.539
other valuable things like spices.

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.709
And as with Frying Pan Alley, there’s

00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:53.669
also a literary connection here.

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:57.039
William Shakespeare, who lived close

00:06:57.059 --> 00:06:59.289
to the King’s Wardrobe sometime around

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.749
the turn of the 16th century, described

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.719
his property in his will as “being in

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:07.869
Blackfriers in London, nere the Wardrobe.”

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:10.659
If you were reading this and thinking

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.779
“near the Wardrobe”?, well, this street

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.349
was so well known that people simply

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:18.239
referred to it as “the wardrobe”.

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:20.569
So, can you go and see

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:21.739
this wardrobe today?

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:23.519
Unfortunately not.

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:26.399
The King’s Wardrobe burnt down in the

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:30.119
Great Fire of London in 1666, but you can

00:07:30.119 --> 00:07:32.779
certainly visit the street and feel smug

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:34.639
about knowing where it got its name from.

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:38.949
For our next street we only have to walk

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:41.499
10 minutes north from Wardrobe Place,

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:44.449
to the strangely named Turnagain Lane.

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:47.979
And indeed, walking, getting

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:49.699
from one point to another, is

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:51.329
going to play an important role

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:53.379
in the story of Turnagain lane.

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:56.259
Another important point to mention in

00:07:56.259 --> 00:07:58.659
this story is about a London river.

00:07:59.109 --> 00:08:00.689
And I’m not talking about the

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.949
River Thames, the big river that

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:05.009
runs from west to east, that cuts

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:06.369
across the belly of the city.

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:09.059
I’m talking about a river

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:10.889
called the River Fleet.

00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:13.919
It doesn’t exist any more, but it

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:16.549
used to run down Farringdon Street and

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:19.079
join the Thames at Blackfriars Bridge.

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:23.129
Crucially, there was no bridge to

00:08:23.129 --> 00:08:25.079
cross the Fleet in this part of

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:27.559
Farringdon, so if you were walking

00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:30.229
down Turnagain Lane you’d have to ‘turn

00:08:30.229 --> 00:08:32.799
again’ and find a different route - it

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.259
was, in other words, a dead end,

00:08:35.439 --> 00:08:37.619
and the street name an instruction.

00:08:39.099 --> 00:08:41.099
And though the river went dry

00:08:41.099 --> 00:08:43.229
in the 18th century, the name

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.559
stuck and remains to this day.

00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:49.569
In fact, it you go to Turnagain Lane today

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:52.269
you’ll find some slightly unattractive

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:54.949
garages, so the instructions in the

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:57.089
street name are just as valid as

00:08:57.089 --> 00:08:58.839
they were several hundred years ago.

00:09:00.429 --> 00:09:02.269
Now, the next on our list

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:04.279
is a little more dramatic.

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:06.509
It’s called Knightrider

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.659
Street, and is just around the

00:09:08.659 --> 00:09:10.479
corner from Wardrobe Place.

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:13.929
It’s Knight with a K, knight, a

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:15.969
soldier in The Middle Ages, rather

00:09:15.969 --> 00:09:17.969
than night, the opposite of day.

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:22.389
Knightrider Street allegedly got its

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:24.759
name because it was the road that knights

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:26.999
would travel down in mediaeval London

00:09:27.189 --> 00:09:28.989
to get to their jousting competitions.

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:33.079
Jousting, in case this word is unfamiliar,

00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:35.679
was a form of duelling, or fighting,

00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:38.109
done by people on horseback with long

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:41.209
lances, long poles, in the mediaeval era.

00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:44.639
And if you are more familiar with American

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:46.889
pop culture than you are with mediaeval

00:09:46.909 --> 00:09:49.199
jousting, which would be understandable,

00:09:49.549 --> 00:09:51.399
you might remember that Knight Rider

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:54.639
was also the name of a popular 1980s

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:56.925
TV drama starring David Hasselhoff.

00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:00.829
There is a signed picture of David

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.079
Hasselhoff in a pub on Knightrider street,

00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:06.269
but unfortunately the name of this street

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:09.869
predates him by, well, almost 700 years,

00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:13.894
with its first recorded use being in 1322.

00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:18.299
Penultimate on our London list is Hanging

00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:20.629
Sword Alley, close to London’s famous

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:22.699
Fleet Street, the place where all the

00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:24.649
big newspapers were traditionally based.

00:10:25.539 --> 00:10:28.149
Hanging Sword Alley allegedly dates

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:30.269
back to the 16th century, if not

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:33.069
before, but historians seem to think

00:10:33.219 --> 00:10:35.169
that it was first called Hanging Sword

00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:38.869
Alley in 1564 because of a sign for a

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:41.419
fencing school that hung in the street.

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:44.529
Fencing, by the way, is the sport where

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:46.729
people fight with thin swords, which

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:48.409
you might have seen in the Olympics.

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:51.399
Interestingly, Hanging Sword Alley

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:53.899
also had another name for a while

00:10:53.909 --> 00:10:56.049
in the 18th century when it became

00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:58.979
known as ‘Blood Bowl Alley’ after a

00:10:58.979 --> 00:11:01.639
well-known disreputable local pub called

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:04.159
Blood Bowl House where a prostitute

00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:06.399
was caught trying to rob a client.

00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:10.429
And once again, this unusual street

00:11:10.429 --> 00:11:12.959
name also has a literary connection,

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:14.939
appearing in Charles Dickens' A

00:11:14.939 --> 00:11:17.489
Tale of Two Cities and Bleak House.

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:21.349
Finally, the last unusual street

00:11:21.349 --> 00:11:23.629
name on our London list, Bleeding

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:26.769
Heart Yard, has two explanations, or

00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:30.079
origins, and two literary connections.

00:11:31.219 --> 00:11:34.299
The first, and perhaps the most believable

00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:36.699
story, but I'll let you be the judge, is

00:11:36.699 --> 00:11:39.479
that it took its name from a 16th century

00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:43.089
inn, a pub, called The Bleeding Heart.

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:46.679
According to this story, the inn’s

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:49.229
sign had a picture of the Virgin Mary’s

00:11:49.229 --> 00:11:51.949
heart being stabbed by several swords.

00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:55.739
This one seems logical, and is

00:11:55.739 --> 00:11:57.119
the type of thing that streets

00:11:57.119 --> 00:11:58.949
are typically named after.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:02.229
The other, slightly less believable

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:04.369
but more exciting story, is that

00:12:04.539 --> 00:12:08.019
on a night in January of 1646 a

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.939
bloody murder occurred in the yard.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:14.189
According to the story, which is more

00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:16.619
of an urban legend at this point, there

00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:19.159
was a ball, a party, that was taking

00:12:19.159 --> 00:12:21.959
place that night, and a strange man

00:12:22.119 --> 00:12:25.309
with a clawed hand appeared as a guest.

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:29.449
He spent the night, the story goes,

00:12:29.619 --> 00:12:32.449
dancing with and charming a woman

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:35.129
named Lady Hatton, a figure from

00:12:35.139 --> 00:12:37.319
England’s 17th century aristocracy.

00:12:38.109 --> 00:12:39.209
The only problem?

00:12:39.609 --> 00:12:42.215
Well, the morning after the party her

00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:45.595
bloodied body was found ripped apart in

00:12:45.595 --> 00:12:48.455
what is now known as Bleeding Heart Yard.

00:12:49.653 --> 00:12:53.005
Her heart, so the legend goes, was

00:12:53.015 --> 00:12:55.725
apparently found lying on the ground,

00:12:56.005 --> 00:12:58.795
still working and pumping out blood.

00:13:00.288 --> 00:13:02.238
Unlikely, perhaps, but it’s

00:13:02.238 --> 00:13:03.338
certainly a good story.

00:13:04.228 --> 00:13:06.928
And Bleeding Heart Yard also has

00:13:06.928 --> 00:13:08.768
a literary connection, and again

00:13:08.768 --> 00:13:10.688
it's the novelist most associated

00:13:10.688 --> 00:13:12.358
with London, Charles Dickens.

00:13:13.568 --> 00:13:16.758
In his novel Little Dorrit, Bleeding Heart

00:13:16.758 --> 00:13:19.448
Yard is the home of the Plornish family.

00:13:20.473 --> 00:13:22.493
But Bleeding Heart Yard’s literary

00:13:22.493 --> 00:13:24.983
connections go even further back than

00:13:25.003 --> 00:13:27.253
Dickens, first appearing in a collection

00:13:27.253 --> 00:13:29.543
of poems and stories published in

00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:33.273
1837 known as the Ingoldsby Legends.

00:13:34.633 --> 00:13:36.873
In one of the stories, a woman

00:13:37.203 --> 00:13:40.063
- presumably Lady Hatton - makes a deal

00:13:40.073 --> 00:13:42.283
with the devil to become very wealthy,

00:13:42.663 --> 00:13:44.803
and during the housewarming of her new

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:47.373
mansion, the party to celebrate her new

00:13:47.383 --> 00:13:50.683
home, the devil arrives, dances with

00:13:50.683 --> 00:13:53.333
her, and then rips out her heart and

00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:55.593
throws it into Bleeding Heart Yard,

00:13:55.863 --> 00:13:58.173
where’s it’s found still squirting out

00:13:58.173 --> 00:14:00.433
blood the next morning - hence the name.

00:14:01.523 --> 00:14:03.393
Well, however it got its name,

00:14:03.783 --> 00:14:05.533
Bleeding Heart Yard - and the

00:14:05.533 --> 00:14:07.563
name - remains to this day.

00:14:09.113 --> 00:14:11.473
So, there are six weird and wonderful

00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:13.883
street names from London, but I would

00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:16.123
be doing an injustice to the rest of the

00:14:16.123 --> 00:14:18.183
country if I didn’t at least mention a

00:14:18.183 --> 00:14:20.393
few more, as there are some wonderful

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:22.493
stories of street names from elsewhere.

00:14:24.123 --> 00:14:26.533
So, without further ado, let me tell

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:28.683
you the story of a street with an

00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:31.203
unusual name because, well, it’s

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:33.353
called “The Street with No Name”.

00:14:33.863 --> 00:14:35.503
That’s actually it’s name, “The

00:14:35.503 --> 00:14:37.573
Street With No Name”, and it’s in

00:14:37.573 --> 00:14:39.733
the village of Teignmouth in Devon,

00:14:39.893 --> 00:14:41.143
to the south west of England.

00:14:42.622 --> 00:14:44.732
And the story of how it got its

00:14:44.732 --> 00:14:46.982
name, or how it didn’t get its name,

00:14:46.992 --> 00:14:49.282
perhaps, is somewhat of a sad one.

00:14:49.892 --> 00:14:52.068
The Street With No Name isn’t really

00:14:52.108 --> 00:14:54.388
a street, per se, it’s more like an

00:14:54.628 --> 00:14:56.908
alleyway between two larger streets.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.052
And it’s somewhat of an accidental street,

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:02.552
it’s really just a gap between two rows of

00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:05.502
houses, but was considered large enough to

00:15:05.502 --> 00:15:08.272
be given a name, although not a real name.

00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:10.792
So, it’s a bit of a sad story

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:12.422
if you ask me, but it's an

00:15:12.422 --> 00:15:14.292
interesting one nevertheless.

00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:18.752
And our final one is the bizarrely

00:15:18.762 --> 00:15:21.042
named Warning Tongue Lane in

00:15:21.052 --> 00:15:22.972
Doncaster, which is in South

00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:24.532
Yorkshire in the north of England.

00:15:25.362 --> 00:15:27.552
The legend goes that there’s somewhat

00:15:27.582 --> 00:15:29.652
of a spooky story to this lane,

00:15:29.702 --> 00:15:31.702
which runs through Doncaster and a

00:15:31.702 --> 00:15:34.022
woodland area, which was itself once

00:15:34.022 --> 00:15:36.641
known as Wailing Wood by locals.

00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:39.811
Wailing, in case you weren’t aware, is

00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:42.641
another way of saying screaming or crying,

00:15:42.961 --> 00:15:45.481
usually from pain or anger or fear.

00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:49.171
Anyway, Wailing Wood got its name,

00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:52.311
apparently, from an old story about a

00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:54.711
carriage which crashed in some fog on

00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:56.751
Warning Tongue Lane many years ago.

00:15:58.301 --> 00:16:01.251
A woman, so the story goes, died in the

00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:03.791
crash and is now thought to haunt the

00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:06.271
woods on foggy nights and warn people

00:16:06.271 --> 00:16:08.421
from driving down the lane, so they

00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:10.291
don’t meet the same fate as she did.

00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:14.441
And Warning Tongue Lane, you might have

00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:16.911
guessed, comes from her wailing warning

00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:19.261
that can be heard on misty nights.

00:16:19.831 --> 00:16:21.471
Spooky stuff indeed.

00:16:22.551 --> 00:16:25.297
So, there you go, six of the most

00:16:25.337 --> 00:16:27.910
unusual street names in London, and

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.940
a couple more from further afield.

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.070
All of these streets still exist

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.110
today, and the London ones are

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.270
actually surprisingly close together.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.710
I plotted them all on Google Maps,

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.520
and it would only take 59 minutes

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.680
for you to visit all six of them.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:47.070
So, if you are planning to a

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.070
visit to London, and you want a

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.730
challenge that you can do in under

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.710
an hour, go and give it a go.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.970
Go to Knightrider Street and Bleeding

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.460
Heart Yard, stop and watch the

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.710
office workers dashing around from

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.400
meeting to meeting, and you can

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.970
feel smug and proud that you know,

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.410
in all probability, a lot more than

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:09.730
them about the weird and wonderful

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.010
stories behind these street names.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.470
Ok then, that is it for today’s

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.450
episode on unusual street names

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.420
in London, with a couple of bonus

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.960
ones from the rest of the country.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.380
It almost goes without saying that

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.030
these are only a small, tiny selection,

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.720
but an interesting one nonetheless.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.260
As always, I would love to know

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.760
what you thought about this episode.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.410
Had you heard the stories of

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.670
any of these streets before?

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.340
What about strange street

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.740
names in your own country?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.110
What’s the most unusual

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.610
street you’ve ever lived on?

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.070
I would love to know, so let’s

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.520
get this discussion started.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.900
You can head right into our

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.530
community forum, which is at

chatting away to other curious minds.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.840
You've been listening to English Learning

for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.590
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:04.650
I'll catch you in the next episode.

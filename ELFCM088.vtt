Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.439
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.160
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.040
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the amazing life of whales.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.120
They are the biggest animals on the planet, glide gracefully through the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.470
oceans, and have a lot more in common with humans than most people think.

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:45.960
We haven’t yet done many episodes on the natural world, but what better

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.650
way to start than this amazing group of animals, and their amazing lives.

00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:55.858
Before we get right into that though, let me just remind you that you

00:00:55.858 --> 00:01:00.488
can get all of the bonus episodes, plus subtitles, transcripts, and

00:01:00.488 --> 00:01:04.838
key vocabulary, over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:10.148
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English, and

00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:15.828
joining a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:20.788
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.558
So if that is of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:28.598
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:30.428 --> 00:01:34.738
OK then, let’s talk about the amazing life of whales.

00:01:35.878 --> 00:01:38.928
Now, let’s start with some definitions, because

00:01:39.158 --> 00:01:43.558
‘whale’ as a term has come to include different things.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:51.408
Some people use ‘whale’ as a synonym, as another word, for Cetacean, which

00:01:51.468 --> 00:01:58.168
is the group of aquatic mammals that include whales, dolphins and porpoises.

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:04.958
In fact, Cetaceans are made up of lots of different species, 89 to be precise,

00:02:05.298 --> 00:02:11.928
and these are broadly split into two groups - the toothed whales, which

00:02:12.168 --> 00:02:19.468
include for instance dolphins and orca, and the baleen whales, the ones that

00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:25.038
don’t have teeth but have a kind of grill in their mouth, like the blue whale.

00:02:25.638 --> 00:02:28.108
We’ll come onto this in more detail in a minute.

00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:34.168
So, in today’s episode we’ll be talking about whales in the general sense,

00:02:34.348 --> 00:02:39.808
because it would be a shame not to mention dolphins, porpoises and orca.

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:46.758
OK then, now we’ve got that out of the way, let’s get on to where they actually came

00:02:46.758 --> 00:02:52.928
from, where they live, and talk about the amazing lives that these creatures lead.

00:02:54.368 --> 00:02:59.238
Firstly, one common misconception about whales is that they are fish.

00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:00.388
They are not.

00:03:00.788 --> 00:03:05.398
They are mammals, and their closest land-relative is the hippopotamus,

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:11.338
although genetically they went different ways about 40 million years ago.

00:03:12.808 --> 00:03:20.238
Whales come in a huge range of shapes and sizes, from the Maui dolphin, which is

00:03:20.608 --> 00:03:28.027
around 1 metre long and weighs 50kg, through to the blue whale, which can be 30 metres

00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:37.107
long and weigh 173 tonnes, or the weight of 25 elephants, not only making it the

00:03:37.107 --> 00:03:43.037
largest animal in the world today, but also the largest animal that has ever lived.

00:03:44.487 --> 00:03:50.747
Not only can whales be absolutely massive, but they can also live for a very long time.

00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:59.457
Killer whales, or orca, can live for more than 100 years, and it’s believed that a type

00:03:59.487 --> 00:04:06.167
of whale called a bowhead whale, which is normally found in the Arctic, can live for

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:13.357
more than 200 years, which makes this type of whale the world’s longest living animal.

00:04:14.626 --> 00:04:21.234
As I said at the start of the episode, whales are divided into two broad groups, based on what

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:29.854
they have in their mouth - teeth, or a kind of grill to catch plankton, little shrimps or fish.

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:35.844
The ones with teeth are generally smaller and quicker, and the

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:40.804
ones with the grill in their mouth are generally bigger and slower.

00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:46.704
The word for this grill thing is baleen, which I imagine

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:49.404
won’t be a word you will need in general conversation.

00:04:50.104 --> 00:04:51.054
Anyway, there you go.

00:04:51.904 --> 00:04:56.154
Baleen is the grill that they have in their mouth, and these kinds

00:04:56.174 --> 00:05:01.264
of whales essentially just glide through the water with their mouths

00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:06.214
open, hoovering up all the little fish and plankton they can find.

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:11.204
You might have known this already, but what you probably

00:05:11.214 --> 00:05:14.124
didn’t know is what this is actually made out of.

00:05:15.054 --> 00:05:22.054
Baleen is actually made out of keratin, which is the same substance that we have on our

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:28.914
fingernails and in our hair, so one way to think about the baleen of a whale is that

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:34.424
it is just hair and fingernail matter that's hanging from the top of a whale's mouth.

00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:41.644
Which makes it sound quite gross, but it is an incredibly effective way of feeding.

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:50.114
Blue whales, which have baleen, eat up to 3,600 kg of shrimp

00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:54.924
every day, which is about the weight of a medium sized elephant.

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:56.604
Quite something, right?

00:05:58.007 --> 00:06:02.561
They tend to prefer colder water, and so are typically found in the

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:07.141
Northern or Southern hemispheres, not so close to the Equator, but they

00:06:07.141 --> 00:06:12.931
will migrate great distances to find food or to mate, to reproduce.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:19.108
Like with many facts about whales, the real numbers here are amazing.

00:06:20.378 --> 00:06:26.418
Several species, including the humpback and blue whales, can travel for over

00:06:26.478 --> 00:06:32.938
a thousand miles without feeding, and the gray whale, which is a relatively

00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:40.628
small whale, but still weighs 27 tonnes, it migrates a total of 16,000

00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:45.748
kilometres every year, going between its feeding and its breeding grounds.

00:06:46.928 --> 00:06:51.878
Again, to put that in perspective, it’s the distance between London and Sydney.

00:06:53.398 --> 00:06:57.308
But whales don’t make these lengthy journeys on their own.

00:06:58.078 --> 00:07:01.528
They are highly social animals, and travel in groups.

00:07:02.425 --> 00:07:10.259
Although we do know quite a lot about how whales interact, there is still a huge amount that isn’t

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:17.479
understood properly, and it seems that the more we find out, the more we realise that we don’t know.

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:21.009
But what we do know is pretty amazing.

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:28.379
Bottlenose dolphins, which are thought to be the most intelligent type of dolphin, and have a brain

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:34.679
that’s a similar size to a human’s, they communicate with each other through clicks and whistles.

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:40.819
Orca, or killer whales, have also learned to talk like dolphins.

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:47.689
There was a study of orca where they found that they could imitate the noises of dolphins.

00:07:48.394 --> 00:07:54.995
This was an amazing discovery, as there are very few animals that are able to actually

00:07:55.185 --> 00:08:01.585
‘learn’ sounds - when something like a dog or a cat makes a sound, they just have

00:08:01.605 --> 00:08:06.765
an innate knowledge about how to make that sound, they haven’t actually learned it.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:13.116
There are in fact only six groups of animals that are known to be able to do this.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:23.236
Parrots, songbirds, hummingbirds, bats, cetaceans - or whales, and can you guess the last one?

00:08:24.196 --> 00:08:25.416
It’s us, humans.

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:31.276
Because whales can ‘learn’ sounds, it’s believed that they

00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:35.106
pass down knowledge of these sounds through generations.

00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:42.646
Young whales listen to the sounds that their mothers, and the members of the group, make,

00:08:43.036 --> 00:08:48.544
and they learn them, so that they can teach their children, they can teach their young.

00:08:50.116 --> 00:08:56.036
Because these are learned, they aren’t innate, different whales have different

00:08:56.056 --> 00:09:02.796
accents, so a blue whale that lives in the North Pacific might make a very different

00:09:02.796 --> 00:09:08.706
sound to a whale from the South Atlantic, even if they’re exactly the same species.

00:09:10.236 --> 00:09:15.586
And it’s worth spending a little bit of time talking about, and then listening, to the

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:22.045
actual kinds of sounds that whales make, because they don’t just make random sounds.

00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:23.446
They sing.

00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:30.011
These songs can be long and complicated humpback whales, for example,

00:09:30.431 --> 00:09:35.971
have songs that last up to 30 minutes, and can be heard from miles away.

00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:42.671
During the breeding season, humpback whales will sing for hours at a time.

00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:46.211
I’ll play a clip of one in a minute, because it is

00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:49.631
pretty cool, but listen to the range that it goes.

00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:57.911
They can make sounds that go 7 octaves, which is almost the entire range of a piano.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:04.341
OK, so here we go, this isn’t going to teach you any English, but it’s pretty cool.

00:10:05.609 --> 00:10:07.909
Here’s a little clip of a whale song.

00:10:42.057 --> 00:10:43.087
Amazing, right?

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:48.587
Although we know that whales sing, and different whales sing in

00:10:48.587 --> 00:10:53.944
different ways, scientists don’t really know exactly why they do it.

00:10:55.374 --> 00:11:01.934
On the subject of communication and intelligence, scientists also observed something

00:11:01.934 --> 00:11:08.884
pretty cool with a group of dolphins, which was that when one dolphin, one member of the

00:11:08.884 --> 00:11:17.034
group, was away, the other members were able to imitate the exact noise that the dolphin

00:11:17.034 --> 00:11:24.344
would make, so the scientists hypothesised that the members could even be gossiping

00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:29.934
about that dolphin, talking about it behind its back, or at least while it wasn’t there.

00:11:31.434 --> 00:11:37.724
So, whales live a pretty amazing life, and they truly are majestic animals.

00:11:38.914 --> 00:11:45.334
It is, in many ways, a miracle that they are still with us, as there was a time

00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:51.714
not so long ago that they were almost wiped off the face of the planet by humans.

00:11:53.334 --> 00:11:58.734
Whales had been hunted for centuries, but it wasn’t until the late 19th

00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:04.434
century, with the invention of the steam ship and the explosive harpoon

00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:10.121
that it became clear that humans were about to drive whales to extinction.

00:12:11.007 --> 00:12:17.177
Indeed, the 20th century saw almost 60 years of intensive whaling,

00:12:17.607 --> 00:12:22.977
whale hunting, where an estimated 2 million whales were killed, and

00:12:23.007 --> 00:12:27.827
multiple whale species were hunted to within an inch of extinction.

00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:34.317
The topic of whaling definitely deserves its own episode, so we won’t go into

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:41.357
it in great detail here, but the process includes hunting, killing, then using

00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:47.857
different parts of the whale for everything from soap, perfume, oil for machines,

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:54.487
board games, clothing, umbrellas, explosives, food, and hundreds of other things.

00:12:55.867 --> 00:13:03.667
In 1927, the League of Nations held a conference on whaling, and gradually quotas were

00:13:03.667 --> 00:13:10.807
introduced, and from the 1960s the number of whales killed every year has been decreasing.

00:13:12.267 --> 00:13:17.437
Still, whales are hunted by 9 different countries, albeit now

00:13:17.447 --> 00:13:22.807
for ‘cultural’ or ‘scientific’ purposes, commercial whaling, the

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:27.917
hunting of whales to sell for a profit, has been banned since 1986.

00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:38.037
And while whales might now not have to be fearful of large, commercial ships coming to launch large

00:13:38.327 --> 00:13:45.737
harpoons into them and turn them into soap, life as a whale isn’t completely without its threats.

00:13:47.177 --> 00:13:53.017
They are often caught in fishing nets, and it’s estimated that, over the course of a

00:13:53.017 --> 00:13:59.927
lifetime, 80% of whales in the North Atlantic are caught in a fishing net at least once.

00:14:01.417 --> 00:14:06.857
Loud noises, from the noises of ship engines, to the noises of underwater

00:14:06.857 --> 00:14:12.257
drills are very disconcerting for whales, and can damage their hearing.

00:14:13.677 --> 00:14:19.967
And whales are killed in large numbers every year just by being hit by ships.

00:14:20.987 --> 00:14:26.407
Remember, although they can dive great distances, they need to come to the surface

00:14:26.457 --> 00:14:32.807
to breathe, and the seas and oceans are full of fast-moving, very heavy ships.

00:14:34.227 --> 00:14:39.207
Indeed, for some of the more endangered whale species, being hit by a

00:14:39.207 --> 00:14:43.777
ship is the main cause of death, the most dangerous threat for them.

00:14:45.327 --> 00:14:50.987
Luckily, for most whales, their life ends at sea, dying of natural causes.

00:14:52.137 --> 00:14:58.637
And as in life, so in death, what happens to a whale when it dies is pretty amazing.

00:15:00.157 --> 00:15:04.327
When a whale dies, it often floats on the surface for

00:15:04.327 --> 00:15:07.947
a while before drifting down all the way to the seabed.

00:15:09.116 --> 00:15:15.417
When the whale’s body has settled - and here’s another bit of very specific, quite

00:15:15.487 --> 00:15:20.837
pointless vocabulary for you - a settled whale's body is called a ‘whale fall’.

00:15:21.707 --> 00:15:26.597
Now, whales can be absolutely huge, as we have already learned, and

00:15:26.817 --> 00:15:34.008
entire ecosystems can live off the whale fall for decades, tens of years.

00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:42.368
There was research from the University of Hawaii that discovered over 12,000 organisms

00:15:42.598 --> 00:15:50.048
from 43 different species that were living off one single whale fall, and they even

00:15:50.048 --> 00:15:58.318
discovered two new types of worm, and a total of 16 completely new species have been

00:15:58.338 --> 00:16:04.598
discovered at whale falls, species that probably wouldn’t even exist without whales

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:12.188
So even in death, I think we can all agree that whales are pretty amazing.

00:16:15.018 --> 00:16:19.188
OK then, that is it for the Amazing Life of Whales.

00:16:19.658 --> 00:16:23.568
They truly are majestic creatures, and I hope that this has

00:16:23.578 --> 00:16:26.988
given you a little insight into the amazing life they lead.

00:16:28.178 --> 00:16:33.528
The internet is, of course, full of amazing clips of whales doing amazing things.

00:16:33.948 --> 00:16:38.608
I’ll leave some links in the show notes, so you should definitely give a few of those a watch.

00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:42.848
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the episode.

00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:45.878
Later on this month, we are going to have a fancy new

00:16:45.878 --> 00:16:49.408
forum on the website to allow you to discuss episodes.

00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:53.258

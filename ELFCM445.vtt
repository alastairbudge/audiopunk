Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.690
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.609
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.930
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the concept of a 15-minute city.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.729
It is both new and old, simple and complicated, a simpler and better way of living,

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:38.760
or, if you ask the British government, perhaps a precursor of a dystopian future.

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.760
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.080
Let me start this episode by asking you a question: what makes the perfect place to live?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.950
It's a question that people have no doubt been asking themselves for as

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.490
long as time, well before the profession of “urban planner” was invented.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.070
And of course, one person’s perfect place will be different to another person’s perfect place.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.260
You might dream of living on the top of a Scottish mountain, isolated from the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.770
world, with only sheep and highland cows for company, while I might dream of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.300
being in the pumping heart of the city, the noise and smells from nearby bars

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.169
and cafes coming in through my window and filling me with a sense of activity.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.340
I imagine that both of our perfect places to live fall somewhere in

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.140
between those extremes, and perhaps we are both lucky enough to have

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.940
some agency, some decision-making power, over where we decide to live.

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:49.959
In the UK, like in many countries, both extremes exist, and, like in most

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.449
countries, the percentage of the population that lives in cities and towns has

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:59.439
changed over the years, as have the structure and layout of towns and cities.

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:06.189
Before trains and cars, towns and cities needed to be walkable, and most

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:09.779
people rarely left their neighbourhoods because they didn’t have the means.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.219
What’s more, everything they needed was within a short walking distance.

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.949
Of course, this is far from some urban utopia.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.399
The reality of this was, if we're talking about Victorian London, working

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:31.059
from dawn to dusk, 6 or 7 days a week under terrible conditions, only to

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.939
return to a cramped damp room that you shared with a dozen other people.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.709
It was about as far from a utopia as you could imagine.

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.396
Moving into the 19th century, as rail networks were laid, and public transport meant that people

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:53.706
didn’t have to live within walking distance of their place of work, those who were able to seized

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:59.196
the opportunity to move out of the crowded city centres, out of cities like London and Manchester.

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:05.806
They could live in bigger houses, perhaps even with a garden, they could breathe fresh air and

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:11.336
hear the birds sing, while still being able to travel to their place of work in the city every day.

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:16.976
And as private car ownership became more widespread, the

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:20.736
nature of smaller towns and cities in Britain changed too.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:26.326
People now didn’t need to live close to a railway station, they could live

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:30.436
anywhere, and they could drive into the town or city to work every day.

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:36.806
The result was a large change in the structure of towns and cities in the UK.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:42.256
The centre of many smaller towns and cities in the country became places where

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:47.666
people came to work and shop, but not places where people tended to live.

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:55.996
Pedestrians became second class citizens, schools and public amenities replaced by car parks.

00:03:56.996 --> 00:04:03.896
And this was a self-perpetuating cycle: as people moved out of city centres and they became

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:08.836
more car dependent, city centres became less attractive places to live, therefore more

00:04:08.836 --> 00:04:13.786
people moved out, their houses were replaced by shops and offices, and the cycle continued.

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:19.166
And moving towards the present day, British town and city

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:23.926
centres, especially their shops in them, faced two large threats.

00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:29.556
Firstly, out of town shopping centres, the large retail parks where

00:04:29.556 --> 00:04:34.356
people could go to buy everything from food to clothing to TVs, often

00:04:34.506 --> 00:04:37.786
with a wider choice than would be available in the town centres.

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:44.056
And secondly, online shopping, where you have all the choice in the world, and you can get

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:49.076
anything delivered to your doorstep, often at a lower cost than you would find at a shop.

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:54.676
So, people simply didn’t need to go into town and city centres nearly as much.

00:04:55.956 --> 00:05:02.456
The result of this is that many British town centres are, if we have to be brutally honest,

00:05:02.866 --> 00:05:08.926
quite miserable places, stripped of character and now with deserted shops and offices.

00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:16.166
If you've been to the centre of London or Oxford or Edinburgh or York you might be thinking

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:21.746
“what’s he saying, they’re lovely”, but you probably haven’t been to places like Portsmouth,

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:27.686
Slough or Swansea, smaller cities that have suffered from these urban planning decisions.

00:05:28.616 --> 00:05:33.286
Now, of course, there are other factors at play, including a faltering economy,

00:05:33.586 --> 00:05:39.106
decades of cuts by a Tory government, and so on, but when we talk about city centres

00:05:39.286 --> 00:05:45.916
specifically, this background helps us understand why some of these areas are how they are.

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:51.376
But there is a plan to rejuvenate British urban environments.

00:05:52.296 --> 00:05:56.056
It's called the 15-minute city, and it's something you may

00:05:56.056 --> 00:05:59.556
well have heard about, as it is not a British plan at all.

00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:05.586
The concept came to prominence during the 2020 successful

00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:09.196
reelection campaign of the Parisian mayor, Anne Hidalgo.

00:06:10.696 --> 00:06:15.006
And the idea of a 15-minute city is a simple one.

00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:20.066
Everyone living in a city should have everything they need to live a happy,

00:06:20.086 --> 00:06:25.986
healthy life, within 15 minutes, either by foot, on a bike or on public transport.

00:06:27.516 --> 00:06:33.746
To break it down, residents should be able to fulfil six core functions within

00:06:33.746 --> 00:06:40.786
15 minutes: living, working, commerce, healthcare, education and entertainment.

00:06:42.161 --> 00:06:48.101
The results, according to the main proponents of the 15-minute city, will be wide-ranging.

00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:53.069
It will lead to an improvement in air quality, as more people will choose to

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:57.939
walk, cycle or take public transportation rather than travel by private car.

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:04.049
It will also lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions, doing a bit to curb global warming.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:09.759
It will lead to better social connections, as people will exist in neighbourhoods

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:15.289
rather than huge, soulless cities where they go from one place to another in a car.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:20.629
It will lead to productivity increases, as people will waste less time travelling.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:24.829
After all, everything will be less than 15 minutes away.

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:29.699
It will improve people’s health, as walking or going on a bike, and

00:07:29.799 --> 00:07:33.569
even fresh air for that matter, this is better than sitting in a car.

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:39.379
And perhaps on a harder to measure level, people will be happier.

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:45.369
After all, the prospect of getting into a car, sitting in a traffic jam and

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:49.319
then navigating an underground car park isn’t a pleasurable one for most

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:54.319
people, and the idea of not doing that, well it would make people happier.

00:07:55.469 --> 00:08:01.349
Now, as you heard a few minutes ago, this 15-minute city plan was a large part of the

00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:06.799
Parisian mayor’s reelection campaign, and it worked, or at least she was reelected.

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:12.299
Perhaps it is no surprise that Paris was the one of the first major Western

00:08:12.299 --> 00:08:17.359
cities to implement this plan, as it already kind of is a 15-minute city.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:23.439
If you have been to Paris, you will know that the city centre is a vibrant place,

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:28.659
with everything you might possibly want or need within 15 minutes, often much less.

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:36.110
Of course, the further out of the centre you get, the less this is the case, but the majority of

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:43.149
Parisians live with this reality, and so being sold on the prospect of intensifying this, improving

00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:49.559
green spaces, increasing bike lanes and so on, presumably this wasn’t a particularly difficult one.

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:56.609
And something that gave Hidalgo, the newly reelected mayor of Paris, an unexpected

00:08:56.639 --> 00:09:01.579
opportunity to fasttrack her 15-minute city plan was the COVID pandemic.

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:05.739
As the city centre emptied, roads were converted to

00:09:05.739 --> 00:09:09.159
bicycle lanes, parking spaces to playgrounds and so on.

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:14.759
The idea was to reduce the attractiveness of driving, and therefore

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:19.359
increase the attractiveness of walking, cycling or taking public transport.

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:25.669
And although the mayor has her fair share of critics, people who complain about her

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:31.309
anti-car policies, initial results suggest that the plan is popular with Parisians.

00:09:32.374 --> 00:09:37.364
And other cities are following suit, they are following the example of Paris.

00:09:38.564 --> 00:09:43.334
From Milan to Cagliari, Cleveland to Utrect, mayors and urban

00:09:43.334 --> 00:09:47.464
planners are looking to this 15-minute city concept for inspiration.

00:09:48.934 --> 00:09:51.574
And this brings us to the UK.

00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:56.574
In British cities, many local councils have proposed

00:09:56.574 --> 00:10:00.264
ideas that are based on this 15-minute city concept.

00:10:01.384 --> 00:10:07.504
Some have slightly different names, such as “20 minute neighbourhood”, but the concept

00:10:07.624 --> 00:10:14.384
is similar: make cities more liveable, and improve access for pedestrians and cyclists.

00:10:15.844 --> 00:10:19.904
As you might expect, it is quite a popular one, with a recent

00:10:19.904 --> 00:10:23.954
survey suggesting that 62% of British people support it.

00:10:25.064 --> 00:10:29.454
And several British towns and cities have started to implement it.

00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:32.114
Oxford is one of the best-known.

00:10:32.874 --> 00:10:38.684
Much of the city centre has become completely pedestrianised, and if you want to travel

00:10:38.684 --> 00:10:43.257
from the north to the south of the city, you can walk or you can cycle through it.

00:10:43.873 --> 00:10:50.714
But if you want to go by car, you have to drive north, get on a motorway and drive all the way

00:10:50.714 --> 00:10:56.734
around the side of the city, and even if you take your car, it is difficult and expensive to

00:10:56.734 --> 00:11:03.818
find parking, and the speed limit in the city has been reduced to 32 kilometres per hour in

00:11:03.818 --> 00:11:10.708
most places,  so it is quicker, cheaper and more convenient for most people to walk or cycle.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:15.983
Of course, Oxford is not alone, and it is not the first

00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:18.578
city to implement these kinds of anti-car measures.

00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:24.008
London, as you may know, has had a similar policy to discourage

00:11:24.008 --> 00:11:27.288
the use of private cars in the centre for over 20 years.

00:11:28.558 --> 00:11:32.038
There is a large area of the city centre of London that is under what’s

00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:36.438
called the “Congestion Charge Zone”, which cars have to pay a fee to enter.

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:41.888
It started off relatively small, £5 a day when it was first

00:11:41.888 --> 00:11:47.738
introduced in 2003, but it is now £15, which is almost €20.

00:11:48.518 --> 00:11:55.068
And if you want to park in central London, it can cost over £50 a day, so taking your

00:11:55.068 --> 00:12:00.388
car into the centre of the city for the day can easily end up costing you more than €80.

00:12:01.608 --> 00:12:06.188
Now broadly, the British government has been supportive of these kinds

00:12:06.188 --> 00:12:10.568
of local initiatives proposed and then implemented by local authorities.

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:15.828
Good stuff, the government says, well done on making our towns and cities more liveable places.

00:12:17.408 --> 00:12:22.788
And as I’m sure is the case also in your country, in the UK the central and

00:12:22.788 --> 00:12:27.768
local government do not always agree on everything, but this seemed to be

00:12:27.768 --> 00:12:31.971
an area in which there was broad consensus, the government was supportive

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:35.581
of the 15-minute city initiatives that were taking place throughout the UK.

00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:42.161
However, last year, the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, changed his mind.

00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:47.441
He lashed out at local councils for their anti-car policies,

00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:52.231
and he specifically took aim at the 15-minute city concept.

00:12:53.694 --> 00:13:01.434
In September of 2023, he unveiled a new policy that backs motorists, it supports car drivers,

00:13:01.794 --> 00:13:08.334
promising to do everything he could to stop policies that would restrict or discourage car use.

00:13:09.564 --> 00:13:14.434
The transport secretary went one step further, saying that he was “calling

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:19.984
time on the misuse of so-called 15-minute cities”, and another minister went

00:13:20.004 --> 00:13:24.324
on the BBC saying that “people are concerned about their civil liberties”.

00:13:25.214 --> 00:13:31.094
Clearly, there was an orchestrated government plan to criticise the 15-minute city concept.

00:13:32.643 --> 00:13:33.823
But why?

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:39.643
It was a curious decision, given that surveys suggest the concept is popular with British

00:13:39.643 --> 00:13:45.813
people, but pundits and commentators have suggested that it is a last ditch attempt to

00:13:45.813 --> 00:13:51.186
win over some voters ahead of what is likely to be a very difficult election in 2024.

00:13:52.463 --> 00:13:58.373
Sunak knows that cars are particularly important for many Tory voters, or Conservative

00:13:58.393 --> 00:14:04.903
Party voters, and he was trying to align himself with them on this car-centric policy.

00:14:06.383 --> 00:14:09.083
But even so, it seemed strange.

00:14:09.503 --> 00:14:14.103
The votes the Conservative party need to win in the upcoming election are not from

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:18.563
the now dwindling number of people who have always voted Conservative; the votes

00:14:18.563 --> 00:14:22.443
they need are from people who think the Conservative Party doesn’t represent them.

00:14:23.986 --> 00:14:27.886
According to some pundits, there is something more sinister about

00:14:27.886 --> 00:14:31.506
this decision, this decision to turn against the 15-minute city.

00:14:32.236 --> 00:14:36.536
See, one thing that kept on being repeated by British ministers was

00:14:36.866 --> 00:14:41.036
“people are concerned”, “we’ve seen it on social media and on forums”.

00:14:42.416 --> 00:14:47.376
If most surveys were suggesting that it was not an issue for regular

00:14:47.376 --> 00:14:51.756
British people, why were British politicians suggesting that it was?

00:14:52.836 --> 00:14:57.866
Well, according to some commentators, this is a so-called “wedge

00:14:57.906 --> 00:15:02.106
issue”, something that the Conservatives can use as a way to get people

00:15:02.116 --> 00:15:05.296
thinking about a subject that they had never really considered before.

00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:13.216
See, this seemingly harmless 15-minute city plan has become the target for conspiracy theories.

00:15:14.696 --> 00:15:20.216
Starting last year, there were reports and posts on forums that the 15-minute city

00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:26.146
concept is part of a global initiative to restrict movement, and the first step in

00:15:26.146 --> 00:15:30.496
a dystopian future where people literally cannot leave their local neighbourhoods.

00:15:31.646 --> 00:15:38.266
According to some conspiracy theorists, the COVID-19 pandemic was the first step by global

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:44.156
elites to get people used to the idea of lockdowns, so that climate emergencies can be declared

00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:49.396
and people are banned from using cars or travelling more than 15 minutes from their homes.

00:15:50.686 --> 00:15:55.676
And while you might think that these ideas would be ideas confined to Facebook posts by

00:15:55.676 --> 00:16:00.926
your crazy cousin or uncle, these ideas are now being repeated by the British government.

00:16:02.306 --> 00:16:07.206
To quote the British transport secretary, “What is sinister, and what we shouldn’t

00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:12.496
tolerate, is the idea that local councils can decide how often you go to the shops, and

00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:17.396
that they can ration who uses the roads and when, and that they police it all with CCTV.”

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:19.016
End quote.

00:16:20.286 --> 00:16:24.856
Here you have the British Minister for Transport saying that the local authorities

00:16:25.026 --> 00:16:30.711
will be deciding how often people can go to the shops and policing this with CCTV.

00:16:31.996 --> 00:16:38.286
To underline, this has never been a part of the 15-minute city project, at least in its original

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:45.376
form; there is no plan to decide how often someone can go to the shops or to use CCTV to punish

00:16:45.376 --> 00:16:51.746
people who break restrictions, but various UK government ministers are pushing the theory that there

00:16:51.746 --> 00:16:58.296
will be, and if the Labour party is voted into power, this will be the reality that Brits face.

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:04.616
You might be familiar with the expression “clutching at straws”, which means trying

00:17:04.626 --> 00:17:09.016
to do anything, no matter how small and pointless, to get out of a situation.

00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:14.846
And this is what many commentators are saying the Tory party is doing by turning on

00:17:14.876 --> 00:17:20.716
15-minute cities - it is trying to sow the seed of doubt in voters’ minds, getting people

00:17:20.716 --> 00:17:26.146
to think that there could be some sinister plan and that only the Tory party will be

00:17:26.156 --> 00:17:30.716
able to save the people of Britain from it; if the Labour party wins, it's game over.

00:17:31.746 --> 00:17:36.606
Now, I use the term “sow a seed of doubt”, because you might be listening

00:17:36.606 --> 00:17:41.176
to this and perhaps my words might have sown a seed of doubt in your mind.

00:17:42.086 --> 00:17:46.156
After all, what if there were a global conspiracy to restrict

00:17:46.176 --> 00:17:49.936
people’s movement, and the 15-minute city plan was just the beginning?

00:17:50.446 --> 00:17:55.336
What if there were some secret master plan to constrict people to their neighbourhoods?

00:17:56.536 --> 00:18:01.656
Clearly, for some people it is a seductive theory, and the fact that

00:18:01.656 --> 00:18:04.926
there is no evidence for it hasn’t stopped people from believing it.

00:18:06.366 --> 00:18:13.206
So, to wrap things up, the idea of the 15 minute city is a powerful one, a return to the

00:18:13.206 --> 00:18:18.626
neighbourhood community feel of yesteryear, but with the advancements of modern technology.

00:18:19.766 --> 00:18:23.616
Understandably, it is a popular idea in the UK, despite

00:18:23.686 --> 00:18:26.516
the British government’s unexpected criticism of it.

00:18:27.606 --> 00:18:33.516
As it stands, cities across the UK, and in every corner of the world, are looking at the

00:18:33.516 --> 00:18:39.066
concept and seeing what elements of it can be incorporated into their towns and cities.

00:18:40.036 --> 00:18:43.326
Is this part of some huge global conspiracy?

00:18:44.236 --> 00:18:49.496
Who knows, but if there is some huge secret global masterplan to make cities

00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:55.506
more liveable, green and friendly, then I, for one, am happy to say count me in.

00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:01.786
OK then, that is it for today's episode on 15 minute cities.

00:19:02.046 --> 00:19:05.012
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:19:09.332 --> 00:19:12.032
Is there much talk of 15 minute cities in your country?

00:19:12.502 --> 00:19:16.852
Do you live in a town or city that has implemented some “15 minute city” policies?

00:19:17.652 --> 00:19:21.002
How has this changed the city, and what do you think of it?

00:19:21.832 --> 00:19:24.942
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

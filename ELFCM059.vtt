Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:16.322
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn interesting

00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:21.452
things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:28.562
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Great Exhibition.

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:37.122
In 1851, in London's Hyde Park, at the height of the British empire, there

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:41.682
was an exhibition the likes of which the world had never seen before.

00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:49.362
It was a way for countries, and Britain in particular, to show themselves off to the

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:57.342
world a sort of grand announcement to the world of, look at us, this is how amazing we are.

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:04.842
It is quite an interesting story and is relatively unknown outside the UK.

00:01:06.262 --> 00:01:11.212
So let's get cracking and start by painting a picture of

00:01:11.212 --> 00:01:16.882
what was going on in Britain and the world just before 1851.

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:22.262
Firstly, it was the height of British colonialism.

00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:27.594
We will save judgment on this for another episode, but

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:31.914
the British empire stretched from Canada to Australia.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.399
There was a saying that the sun never sets on the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.529
British empire, and in 1851 this was certainly true.

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:46.719
Secondly, from a technological point of view, the world had

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.819
been experiencing some exciting and revolutionary changes.

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:57.279
The Industrial Revolution had seen the invention of

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:00.729
things like the steam engine and the sewing machine.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.602
And of course, this was before true mass media, especially on a global scale,

00:02:08.932 --> 00:02:15.082
and although people may have heard of some of these new marvelous inventions,

00:02:15.412 --> 00:02:21.142
they knew very little about them, and most probably had never seen any of them.

00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:30.859
And coming to Britain, Britain had just defeated the French in the Napoleonic War 35

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:37.549
years beforehand, but there was still some serious rivalry between these two neighbours.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.984
In Britain, Queen Victoria was on the throne, and her husband, Albert, was keen

00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:52.974
for there to be a way for Britain to show itself off to the world, to show off the

00:02:52.974 --> 00:03:01.331
great industrial inventions, but also to show off the variety of jewels that he

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:08.206
had acquired through its empire building the most important of course, was India.

00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:17.266
The French had actually held an event in 1844 called the Industrial Exposition,

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:23.476
but of course the British had to do something bigger, better, and more

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:29.026
impressive than what their rivals across the channel had done a few years before.

00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:31.336
Otherwise, what was the point?

00:03:32.836 --> 00:03:39.226
So it was decided that an event would be held in London in 1851.

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:44.705
The venue was suggested by Lord Wellington, the man famous

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:49.145
for defeating the French at the battle of Waterloo in 1815.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:56.623
It was to take place in Hyde Park, which was at this time, a park to the west of the city.

00:03:57.677 --> 00:04:03.227
Now, regular listeners to this podcast will remember that Harrods, the

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:08.942
famous department store moved its location partly to be next to where the

00:04:08.942 --> 00:04:14.612
exhibition was to be held in order to capitalise on the passing traffic.

00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:22.774
There was also a competition to design the building in which the exhibition was to be held.

00:04:24.144 --> 00:04:27.834
Firstly, the building had to be sufficiently large.

00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:33.544
If the French were to be outdone, this exhibition had to be not

00:04:33.544 --> 00:04:39.274
only the best, but also the biggest this space had to be huge.

00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:45.884
And naturally it had to be luxurious and opulent, it had

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:50.474
to be huge, but it also had to be incredibly stylish.

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:57.194
It would just be embarrassing to be outdone by the French on style.

00:04:58.596 --> 00:05:05.256
The contract for designing the structure was won by a company called Fox and

00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:12.626
Henderson, and they proposed a huge glass building, a bit like a glass conservatory.

00:05:13.976 --> 00:05:23.246
And when I say it was huge, it really was huge, both for a building of its era and also even now.

00:05:24.176 --> 00:05:32.306
It took around 5,000 men to erect, and it was 564 metres long and

00:05:32.336 --> 00:05:38.166
33 metres high that's about the length of five football pitches.

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:42.712
And it was all made out of glass and metal.

00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:50.752
It really was quite a spectacle to behold, and it was named The Crystal Palace.

00:05:51.935 --> 00:05:56.851
Battling against the clock, it was finished just on time, and The

00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:03.424
Great Exhibition was opened by Queen Victoria on the 1st of May, 1851.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:11.199
The stated aim, the objective of The Great Exhibition was as a

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:16.959
celebration of art in industry for the benefit of all nations.

00:06:18.107 --> 00:06:25.017
In reality, though, it was mainly a way for Britain to show off both show

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:31.047
off its developments in manufacturing and industry and show off its empire.

00:06:32.566 --> 00:06:38.904
And while this was Britain's way to show itself off to the world, the main

00:06:39.084 --> 00:06:44.694
attendees of the exhibition, the main people who actually went to the exhibition

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:52.231
were British people Britain was showing itself off to itself, to its own people.

00:06:53.641 --> 00:06:58.921
International travel was of course, practically non existent and only

00:06:58.921 --> 00:07:04.891
accessible to the most wealthy, but domestic travel in Great Britain had

00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:11.701
just started to become possible en masse with the arrival of the railways.

00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:19.381
And people came from all over Britain to marvel at the items on display.

00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:26.046
A total of 6 million people visited The Great Exhibition, which

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:30.426
was about a third of the population of Britain at the time.

00:07:32.206 --> 00:07:40.756
It said that there was even a woman in her eighties who walked all the way from Cornwall to attend.

00:07:41.596 --> 00:07:43.666
That's over 400 kilometres.

00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:49.496
I should say though, that this story appears to have been slightly exaggerated.

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:56.939
If you are familiar yet with British history, or even if you have listened to some

00:07:56.939 --> 00:08:02.689
of our earlier episodes where we talk about Britain in the 19th century, you will

00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:09.889
remember that life in Victorian Britain for the majority of people was pretty tough.

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:15.679
Poverty was widespread, living conditions were pretty

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:20.397
terrible, and generally it wasn't a great time to be alive.

00:08:21.798 --> 00:08:28.777
Albert, Queen Victoria's husband was acutely aware of this situation and

00:08:28.777 --> 00:08:34.717
wanted to keep the cost of tickets low so that anyone in society could attend.

00:08:36.312 --> 00:08:42.451
Cheap day tickets were sold for today's equivalent of about five pounds,

00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:48.976
which is about $7, so they were affordable even for the poorest in society.

00:08:50.043 --> 00:08:57.423
And of course it wasn't just for society's poorest Queen Victoria opened the exhibition,

00:08:57.483 --> 00:09:05.063
of course, but she actually came back and visited a total of 41 times over the five

00:09:05.063 --> 00:09:10.853
and a half months that the exhibition went on for, so she came back twice a week.

00:09:12.383 --> 00:09:18.053
But what actually was on display at The Great Exhibition in The Crystal Palace?

00:09:18.233 --> 00:09:19.613
That's what you're probably thinking.

00:09:20.423 --> 00:09:25.823
Well, there was certainly enough to see to keep Queen Victoria coming back for more.

00:09:26.573 --> 00:09:34.398
There were around 100,000 different objects from over 15,000 different contributors.

00:09:35.328 --> 00:09:43.668
Britain, being the host, took up half of the space and the remainder was left for other countries.

00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:51.198
And going through the list of different things that were on display is absolutely fascinating.

00:09:51.908 --> 00:09:57.848
There was a printing press that could print 5,000 copies of a newspaper in an hour.

00:09:58.658 --> 00:10:03.068
There was a machine for making cigarettes on an industrial scale.

00:10:04.028 --> 00:10:11.108
There was a new kind of counting machine that, it was said, would put accountants out of business.

00:10:12.438 --> 00:10:17.718
Queen Victoria reportedly wrote in her diary that the event contained

00:10:18.243 --> 00:10:22.863
'every conceivable invention', every invention that you could think about.

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:30.093
And for most people visiting, this must have been the most amazing experience.

00:10:30.273 --> 00:10:35.703
They were looking into the future, seeing all of these fantastic things

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:41.253
that might make their lives better, make things faster, easier, cheaper.

00:10:41.793 --> 00:10:44.583
It must have just been such an incredible feeling.

00:10:46.463 --> 00:10:53.740
One invention that was first shown at The Great Exhibition that you will most certainly

00:10:53.740 --> 00:11:00.640
be aware of and I imagine you may have already used today, is quite an interesting one.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.750
It is the flushing toilet.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.120
The first flushing toilet was created by a man called George

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.260
Jennings, who was a plumber from Brighton, to the South of London.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:23.600
But instead of just having this flushing toilet as an item at the exhibition for people

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:31.370
to look at, he created the first what were called public waiting rooms, so visitors to

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.370
the exhibition could use this new invention for themselves, they could use the toilets.

00:11:38.093 --> 00:11:40.313
But they couldn't use them for free.

00:11:40.763 --> 00:11:46.388
It cost one penny to use the public toilets, but you got,

00:11:46.317 --> 00:11:49.497
at least in my opinion, pretty good service for that.

00:11:50.307 --> 00:11:59.127
For one penny, you got a clean seat, a towel, a comb, and a shoe shine, someone to shine your shoes.

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:08.884
Over the course of the exhibition, 827,280 visitors paid one penny to

00:12:08.884 --> 00:12:13.585
use them, and this has actually left a mark on the English language.

00:12:14.515 --> 00:12:20.815
To spend a penny in case you weren't aware, is a polite expression in English

00:12:20.815 --> 00:12:26.971
for to go to the bathroom and it comes from The Great Exhibition, it comes

00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:35.191
from the 827,280 visitors in 1851 who spent a penny to visit the bathroom.

00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:43.405
Other than the evidently great invention of the flushing toilet, the exhibition was viewed

00:12:43.435 --> 00:12:50.275
as a huge success, a great way to showcase the developments in manufacturing and industry.

00:12:51.355 --> 00:12:55.105
So, of course, other countries wanted to do their own ones.

00:12:55.572 --> 00:13:03.642
Napoleon III decided to have the second World's Fair in 1855 in Paris, and

00:13:03.642 --> 00:13:08.982
obviously the French got quite a taste for these, holding eight expositions

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:17.472
between the years of 1855 and 1937 each of which left its own mark on the city.

00:13:18.645 --> 00:13:24.043
The most famous landmark left by one of these French expositions is

00:13:24.103 --> 00:13:29.703
the Eiffel tower, which was created to celebrate the 1899 exposition.

00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:39.103
But if you are wondering what happened to The Crystal Palace though, where that is now and why

00:13:39.103 --> 00:13:45.073
you don't seem to see that in London's travel guides, I have some unfortunate news for you.

00:13:46.847 --> 00:13:51.227
After The Great Exhibition, the structure was moved out of Hyde

00:13:51.227 --> 00:13:56.207
Park and to an area to the South of London called Sydenham.

00:13:57.877 --> 00:14:04.807
The Crystal Palace had been built specially so that it was easy to be moved and it was

00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:13.087
taken down and put back up in what was, at the time, a sleepy little village outside London.

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:20.541
After it was transported to Sydenham, it was used for a variety of different

00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:27.051
purposes for the next 50 years or so, but tragically, it was burned down

00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:35.211
in a fire in 1936 and unfortunately it didn't have the right insurance.

00:14:35.511 --> 00:14:41.589
So when it burned down, that was it, there was no money left to rebuild it.

00:14:43.059 --> 00:14:47.949
As London grew though, the little village of Sydenham gradually

00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:54.189
was swallowed up by the city and Sydenham now is part of London.

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:59.734
The legacy of that building, The Crystal Palace, is that

00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:03.964
the area that it is in is now called Crystal Palace.

00:15:04.894 --> 00:15:08.914
The football fans among you may recognise the name from

00:15:09.124 --> 00:15:12.004
the football club of the same name, Crystal Palace.

00:15:14.104 --> 00:15:21.654
But the football club and the name for the area aren't the biggest legacies that it has left behind.

00:15:23.199 --> 00:15:28.779
There is, of course, the more symbolic legacy of The Great Exhibition

00:15:28.809 --> 00:15:34.389
as a concept, of countries even now wanting to show themselves

00:15:34.419 --> 00:15:39.969
off to the world, but that's not actually what I'm talking about.

00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:45.409
I'm talking about a more solid, a more concrete legacy.

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:52.534
Contrary to what many people thought when they had

00:15:52.534 --> 00:15:57.154
the idea, the exhibition actually turned a profit.

00:15:57.394 --> 00:16:00.794
It ended up with a pile of money from all the ticket

00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:05.074
sales, about 18 million pounds in today's money.

00:16:05.884 --> 00:16:10.624
It had made so much money through ticket sales, even though the

00:16:10.624 --> 00:16:15.604
tickets were pretty cheap that it was left with a pile of cash.

00:16:16.624 --> 00:16:19.294
So, what happened to this money?

00:16:19.954 --> 00:16:26.374
Well, it all went back into the education of the masses, you can say, and of creating

00:16:26.374 --> 00:16:33.784
an area of museums just south of Hyde Park in an area called South Kensington.

00:16:35.164 --> 00:16:40.624
These museums are still around today, and if you have been to London,

00:16:40.924 --> 00:16:45.124
then there's probably a good chance that you have been to one of

00:16:45.124 --> 00:16:50.779
them, and you have benefited from the legacy of The Great Exhibition.

00:16:51.439 --> 00:16:53.059
I know that I certainly have.

00:16:54.289 --> 00:17:00.649
These museums are the Science Museum, the Natural History Museum, the Victoria

00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:06.289
and Albert Museum, as well as the Imperial College of Science, the Royal

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:12.143
College of Arts, Music and Organists, and of course the Royal Albert Hall.

00:17:13.613 --> 00:17:18.983
So all of these fantastic museums that are now free for anyone

00:17:18.983 --> 00:17:23.033
to enter were all made possible by this Great Exhibition.

00:17:24.593 --> 00:17:31.463
Of course, this story has been forgotten by most people, but it's an amazing thing

00:17:31.703 --> 00:17:38.993
that the creation of all of these great museums comes from this one event over

00:17:38.993 --> 00:17:45.383
150 years ago, which was attended by a third of the entire country's population.

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:51.143
We didn't get an Eiffel Tower out of it, but we did get a

00:17:51.143 --> 00:17:55.073
fantastic collection of museums and the flushing toilet.

00:17:56.183 --> 00:17:58.853
I think I know which of those I prefer.

00:18:00.653 --> 00:18:04.433
Okay then, that is it for today's episode.

00:18:04.868 --> 00:18:08.768
I hope that it's been an interesting one, and if you didn't know about

00:18:08.768 --> 00:18:13.178
The Great Exhibition before, well you know a lot more about it now.

00:18:14.378 --> 00:18:17.198
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:18:17.528 --> 00:18:21.128
You can email hi Hi@leonardoenglish.com.

00:18:22.598 --> 00:18:27.608

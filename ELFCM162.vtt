Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:17.076
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:21.836
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:29.796
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the genius of William Shakespeare.

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:34.156
I imagine that you will be familiar with the name, and

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:37.776
you are probably familiar with at least some of his work.

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:42.406
He is the most famous playwright of all time, in the

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:46.216
English language certainly, and debatably, in any language.

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:52.276
His most famous works include Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, King

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:56.816
Lear, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and he was a prolific writer.

00:00:57.396 --> 00:01:04.406
So, in today’s episode we are going to talk about his life, his work, his language, and his genius.

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:10.406
Before we get right into this episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:15.466

00:01:51.932 --> 00:01:55.862
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:55.882 --> 00:02:00.042
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:04.112
OK then, William Shakespeare.

00:02:05.532 --> 00:02:13.372
On April 23rd, 2014 there was an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum in London.

00:02:14.332 --> 00:02:19.042
Its title was “Shakespeare: Greatest Living Playwright”.

00:02:20.202 --> 00:02:25.062
The exhibition was to celebrate the 450th anniversary

00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:30.322
of William Shakespeare’s birth, on April 23rd 1564.

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:34.642
So, one might think that the title of the exhibition

00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:39.182
was a little bit strange - Greatest living playwright.

00:02:39.762 --> 00:02:44.612
A playwright is someone who writes plays, and living means alive, not dead.

00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:49.402
But Shakespeare is certainly not living in the

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:53.032
corporeal sense of the word, he isn’t physically alive.

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:59.042
In fact, he died on his birthday at the not-so-old age of just 52.

00:03:00.591 --> 00:03:05.062
But there is something about Shakespeare that is certainly

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:08.862
living, something timeless about the man and his work.

00:03:09.552 --> 00:03:14.272
Indeed, there’s an episode in a book about Shakespeare by a man named

00:03:14.282 --> 00:03:19.302
James Shapiro where he recounts putting on a performance of Shakespeare

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:24.072
in the famous Rikers prison in New York, in front of the inmates.

00:03:25.112 --> 00:03:30.842
He writes that the two questions he gets every time from the inmates are “how

00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:36.252
many plays did Shakespeare write?”, and the second one is “is he still alive?”.

00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:42.232
Now, the answer to the first question is at least 37, and the

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:46.332
answer to the second is, of course, no, in the physical sense.

00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:51.522
But the fact that the question is even asked of whether he is still

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:57.372
alive tells us how vibrant and universal the works of Shakespeare are.

00:03:58.522 --> 00:04:03.092
Whether it’s a production of Hamlet, King Lear, or Much Ado About

00:04:03.092 --> 00:04:08.472
Nothing, the themes in these plays speak to all of us, no matter where

00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:13.332
we are from, when we are living, or anything about our situation.

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:19.452
Other people have provided plenty of memorable quotations which capture

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:25.514
Shakespeare’s great gifts and his universal appeal, but I will give just two.

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:32.862
His fellow playwright, Ben Jonson, writing in the preface to the first published edition of

00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:40.586
Shakespeare’s plays, the First Folio, put it neatly: “ He was not of an age, but for all time".

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:44.405
He was not of an age, but for all time.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:50.619
And the English poet, William Auden, wrote that in Shakespeare

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:56.069
“The words of a dead man/are modified in the guts of the living.”

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.499
The guts means your stomach.

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:06.049
So, to repeat, that’s “the words of a dead man/are modified in the guts of the living”

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.309
Powerful stuff, right?

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:14.359
In this episode we will explore some of these themes of universality,

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:18.869
but first let’s start with a brief introduction to the man himself.

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.549
It will be brief, partly because we do not know all that much

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:29.099
about it and mainly because other things are much more interesting.

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:36.209
We think he was born on April 23rd, 1564 and died, on

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.309
or close to his birthday in April 1616, aged just 52.

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.189
He had a good, highly traditional, classically-based education at the

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.639
grammar school in his place of birth, Stratford upon Avon, a town in the West

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.319
Midlands, more or less in the middle of England, and just south of Birmingham.

00:05:57.339 --> 00:06:03.979
He did not attend university, and married a 26-year-old woman when he was just 18 years old.

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.499
This was unusual on both counts – the age difference between

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:13.729
him and his wife and his relative youth when he got married.

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:19.369
But, she was 3 months pregnant at the time, which probably helps explain things.

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:27.099
He spent much of his life in London, where we think he was based from about 1592.

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:33.839
He was an actor, a playwright and a part owner of a theatre company.

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:40.079
His writing career was relatively brief but highly successful commercially;

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.879
when it was over in 1611, he retired from his career as a playwright

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:50.429
and theatre owner and returned to his birthplace, Stratford upon Avon.

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:56.249
During these final years he was a wealthy fellow, a rich man.

00:06:57.149 --> 00:07:04.686
He was, to use an understatement or to put it mildly, a highly productive writer, writing around

00:07:04.686 --> 00:07:11.416
37 plays, mostly on his own, although he collaborated with another playwright on two or three.

00:07:12.406 --> 00:07:19.426
He also wrote two long poems and a collection of 154 short poems called sonnets.

00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:26.406
These contain some of his most famous lines, such as “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”

00:07:27.496 --> 00:07:32.726
I need at this point to deal with the various theories about whether the person

00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:37.326
we know as William Shakespeare really was the person who wrote the plays.

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:44.606
This I will do swiftly through saying that there are numerous conspiracy theories which

00:07:44.636 --> 00:07:50.866
continue to sell books but which most serious scholars dismiss, they say they are not true.

00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:56.276
These theories claim that Shakespeare’s plays were written by other people.

00:07:57.216 --> 00:08:02.246
I don’t think that is true, and nor do most serious Shakespeare historians.

00:08:02.786 --> 00:08:08.556
Even if it were true, what we know is that the plays and the poems were written by

00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:15.216
the same person; frankly it is not of great interest whether that person corresponds

00:08:15.346 --> 00:08:19.336
with the man with a pointy beard whose face you are no doubt familiar with.

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:24.656
That one person could produce so much brilliant work means we are

00:08:24.686 --> 00:08:29.236
dealing with a genius in the Leonardo Da Vinci or Mozart league;

00:08:29.466 --> 00:08:32.796
it doesn’t really matter whether his name was William Shakespeare.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:38.796
We are on more secure and productive grounds if we talk a little

00:08:38.946 --> 00:08:42.846
about Shakespeare’s influence on our language and culture.

00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:49.196
He is the world’s best selling author – very possibly in any language, but certainly

00:08:49.196 --> 00:08:55.696
in English, with estimates of sales of his works ranging from 2 to 4 billion

00:08:55.696 --> 00:09:01.276
copies, and his works have been translated into every major living language.

00:09:01.926 --> 00:09:07.016
I imagine you might have read some Shakespeare, or seen a play in your language.

00:09:08.286 --> 00:09:14.216
Something in excess of 64 million children study his works every year.

00:09:14.826 --> 00:09:18.786
Over 400 films and TV productions of his plays have been made.

00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:22.926
Close to 150,000 books have been written about him.

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:28.866
There is indeed a whole industry of Shakespeare writing or writing about Shakespeare.

00:09:29.996 --> 00:09:36.276
Some people go even further, and devote their entire lives to the study of the great man.

00:09:36.996 --> 00:09:40.256
There is even a word in English for people who are

00:09:40.256 --> 00:09:44.275
completely passionate Shakespeare fans: bardolator.

00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:50.306
The old English word for a poet or singer, bard, is used to describe him by some

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:55.986
people – capitalised, of course: so, Shakespeare is referred to as “the Bard”.

00:09:56.586 --> 00:10:00.816
So, a bardolator is someone who particularly adores

00:10:00.876 --> 00:10:04.846
Shakespeare, and bardology is the study of Shakespeare.

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:09.988
These bardolators, these passionate Shakespeare fans, sometimes

00:10:09.988 --> 00:10:14.578
go to extraordinary lengths to pursue their love for the man.

00:10:15.878 --> 00:10:21.665
One amazing example of this is of an American man called Eugene Schieffelin,

00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:27.468
and involves a bird called a starling, which is a type of small songbird.

00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:33.498
Starlings didn’t exist in North America, but Schieffelin reportedly wanted

00:10:33.498 --> 00:10:38.068
to bring every bird mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays to North America.

00:10:39.078 --> 00:10:44.838
In 1890 he imported 60 birds and released them in New York’s

00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:48.628
Central Park, and then released another 40 a year later.

00:10:49.678 --> 00:10:56.338
These birds obviously enjoyed life in the US, and there are now over 200 million

00:10:56.338 --> 00:10:58.618
starlings in the country.

00:10:58.618 --> 00:10:59.758
All because

00:10:59.808 --> 00:11:01.938
of one man’s passion for The Bard.

00:11:03.088 --> 00:11:08.938
Now, while not everyone needs to be a bardolator, or a devoted fan of Shakespeare,

00:11:09.298 --> 00:11:14.348
it is impossible to fail to appreciate his impact on the English language.

00:11:15.268 --> 00:11:22.208
We think that over 1,700 words were introduced to the English language by Shakespeare.

00:11:23.488 --> 00:11:27.098
Some of these words you won’t find in common usage, but

00:11:27.128 --> 00:11:30.158
there are hundreds of them that you probably know already.

00:11:30.808 --> 00:11:37.778
Critic, Bedroom, Birthplace, Fashionable, Lonely, Traditional, the list goes on.

00:11:39.088 --> 00:11:43.718
Now, you might be thinking, hang on, if he invented so

00:11:43.718 --> 00:11:47.668
many words, how did people understand what he was saying?

00:11:48.448 --> 00:11:52.768
Wouldn’t it be a little strange to go to a play that you thought

00:11:52.818 --> 00:11:56.598
was in your own language, and find all of these new words?

00:11:57.498 --> 00:12:03.028
Well, perhaps, but Shakespeare’s talent was for joining different words,

00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:09.728
for adding prefixes and suffixes, and creating memorable images from these

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:14.328
combined words, so that people would easily figure out what they meant.

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:24.068
For example, he was a huge fan of adding “un” (UN) to the start of a word to create the negative,

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:32.318
so he was the first recorded person to use words such as “unaware”, “uncomfortable”, and “undress”.

00:12:33.108 --> 00:12:37.448
And in terms of the expressions that he created, we have examples

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:43.798
such as being a “tower of strength”, or describing the “dogs of war”.

00:12:44.838 --> 00:12:48.978
These might have been expressions that were new to the language, but

00:12:49.128 --> 00:12:53.698
they are so vivid and powerful that they are immediately understandable.

00:12:54.728 --> 00:12:58.815
His own vocabulary was so vast it is thought to have

00:12:58.815 --> 00:13:02.278
been at least double the vocabulary of a normal person.

00:13:03.398 --> 00:13:08.398
In total, he used around 20,000 words in his works, and of those

00:13:08.398 --> 00:13:14.652
20,000, remarkably there are 7000 words which he uses only once.

00:13:15.359 --> 00:13:20.638
Now, this is not to put you off Shakespeare, but rather to stress

00:13:20.828 --> 00:13:25.268
quite how important he is for the English language, and to underline

00:13:25.278 --> 00:13:29.608
that he wasn’t just a writer of English, but a creator of English.

00:13:30.618 --> 00:13:33.828
In terms of the UK tourist industry and the country‘s

00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:37.278
“soft power”, Shakespeare is immensely important.

00:13:37.858 --> 00:13:42.998
In a survey done by the British Council in 2016 [which was actually

00:13:43.248 --> 00:13:47.428
commemorating the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death”] he was

00:13:47.428 --> 00:13:52.768
described as “one of the UK‘s most successful ever cultural exports.”

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:58.248
His ability to capture an idea in a memorable expression

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:02.528
means that he has been woven into our everyday speech.

00:14:03.348 --> 00:14:08.228
If you are interested in learning more about the full range of words and expressions

00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:12.778
first used by Shakespeare, there is an article on the Leonardo English blog all

00:14:12.778 --> 00:14:17.648
about it, and it covers everything from “in a fool’s paradise” to “foul play”.

00:14:18.768 --> 00:14:24.078
Now, let’s talk briefly about Shakespeare’s working life, as how and

00:14:24.088 --> 00:14:28.768
why he wrote is really important for an understanding of his work.

00:14:29.908 --> 00:14:34.158
Shakespeare wasn’t some solitary genius sitting in an

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:38.088
isolated small room, on his own writing these masterpieces.

00:14:38.608 --> 00:14:39.418
Quite the opposite.

00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:46.098
Shakespeare‘s writing life as a playwright was entirely based around the practical business

00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:51.658
of writing and putting on plays for his group of actors, and for his devoted audiences.

00:14:52.648 --> 00:14:59.248
We think that his group or company of actors would have contained around 15 people.

00:15:00.678 --> 00:15:04.458
Shakespeare did some acting himself so was entirely

00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:08.058
familiar with the work of an actor, and how theatres worked.

00:15:09.438 --> 00:15:16.038
When he wrote a new play, he would have had individual roles very much in mind for particular

00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:23.968
members of his actors’ company; for example, his chief actor, a man named Richard Burbage, was

00:15:23.998 --> 00:15:30.088
clearly the man for the main parts in his tragedies, playing Macbeth, Hamlet and King Lear.

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:37.218
Early comic roles, such as Bottom, were written with a man called Will

00:15:37.248 --> 00:15:42.428
Kemp in mind - Kemp was clearly a gifted comic, he was a funny man.

00:15:43.428 --> 00:15:47.608
Here I need to mention one other crucial element of Shakespeare’s

00:15:47.648 --> 00:15:51.838
acting company: it was all male, there were no women.

00:15:52.858 --> 00:15:57.058
Contemporary belief was that acting in theatres, which were sometimes

00:15:57.088 --> 00:16:02.408
wild places of entertainment, was not a suitable activity for a woman.

00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:09.908
This was partly based on a religious objection to acting as something that was wrong

00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:15.828
or sinful because it involved deception or pretending to be someone that you are not.

00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:23.368
It was also because of the beliefs in Elizabethan England around how a woman should behave.

00:16:23.788 --> 00:16:27.728
She should be at home, looking after children, not too

00:16:27.768 --> 00:16:32.418
opinionated, and playing a subservient role to her husband.

00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:36.708
So, women were discouraged from acting, and

00:16:37.098 --> 00:16:41.528
Shakespeare’s company, his group of actors, was all male.

00:16:42.298 --> 00:16:45.368
But, as you will know, there are plenty of female

00:16:45.368 --> 00:16:49.048
characters in Shakespeare plays, so how did that work?

00:16:50.068 --> 00:16:54.308
These female roles were played by young boys with unbroken voices;

00:16:54.678 --> 00:16:59.288
young men, typically under 16 years of age, who still had high voices.

00:17:00.278 --> 00:17:05.278
I will return to some of the consequences of this for modern productions, but,

00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:10.618
given the complexity of many of many of the female parts in Shakespeare, there must

00:17:10.618 --> 00:17:16.488
have been some incredibly talented boys playing these rich and varied female roles.

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:23.552
I should also add that Shakespeare’s plays were not only immensely popular but that

00:17:23.552 --> 00:17:29.248
his audiences were drawn from right across society, the plays were for everyone.

00:17:30.288 --> 00:17:34.838
If you did not have much money, you could get in and watch one of

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:40.028
these productions, for around 6 Euros in today’s money, provided that

00:17:40.028 --> 00:17:43.908
you did not mind standing in the flat space in front of the stage.

00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:50.038
These people were known as the groundlings, and often these groundlings, the

00:17:50.168 --> 00:17:54.828
standing audience, would play an active and noisy part in the production.

00:17:56.038 --> 00:18:02.058
Now, onto what I think is the most important part of this episode, the one that I started off with,

00:18:02.268 --> 00:18:09.008
which is Shakespeare‘s universality – the way in which his plays, which are performed daily all

00:18:09.008 --> 00:18:15.708
over the world, speak to different people and seem to often be so relevant to our day to day lives.

00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:19.158
I will base this around three of his plays.

00:18:20.018 --> 00:18:26.098
Firstly and continuing the idea of those boy actors playing major female

00:18:26.098 --> 00:18:30.658
roles, I want to talk about one of the great comedies, Twelfth Night.

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:37.258
Now, I will not not try to describe the story or plot, but merely say that

00:18:37.278 --> 00:18:43.177
it involves a woman, Viola, who disguises herself as a man, she pretends to

00:18:43.177 --> 00:18:48.471
be a man, called Cesario, who then falls in love with a man called Orsino.

00:18:49.187 --> 00:18:54.017
So, a woman dressed as a man, who then falls in love with a man.

00:18:54.857 --> 00:18:59.707
At the same time, another woman, Olivia, falls in love with

00:18:59.737 --> 00:19:04.387
Cesario, who is, remember, Viola, a woman disguised as a man.

00:19:05.443 --> 00:19:06.153
Confused?

00:19:06.663 --> 00:19:07.783
That is not surprising!

00:19:08.443 --> 00:19:13.313
Well, there is plenty of comic value in this situation, it is very funny.

00:19:13.983 --> 00:19:20.955
But there is also much scope for contemporary directors to explore ideas around gender

00:19:20.955 --> 00:19:26.783
fluidity and sexual attraction: are we all confined to the gender that we were born into?

00:19:27.223 --> 00:19:31.573
Are historic or traditional ideas about sexual attraction too

00:19:31.583 --> 00:19:36.313
limiting, when many people choose to define themselves more loosely?

00:19:37.533 --> 00:19:43.623
A play like Twelfth Night with these four characters attracted to each other in different ways

00:19:43.863 --> 00:19:50.663
allows modern productions to explore such things as gender fluidity and the mysteries of sexual

00:19:50.663 --> 00:19:57.103
attraction - we might not have control over who we fall in love with, and does gender really matter?

00:19:58.173 --> 00:20:03.163
To add another layer of confusion, consider this: that in Shakespeare’s

00:20:03.163 --> 00:20:09.643
day, the actor playing Viola was a young boy playing a girl playing a boy.

00:20:10.843 --> 00:20:16.273
Just as a modern production of Twelfth Night might speak to a twenty-first century

00:20:16.273 --> 00:20:22.313
audience in Western Europe now very differently to a similar audience from 50 years

00:20:22.313 --> 00:20:28.643
ago, so one of Shakespeare’s most complex tragedies, Hamlet, will be interpreted by a

00:20:28.663 --> 00:20:34.193
director differently depending on the social and political circumstances of that country.

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:41.813
One of the best known examples of this was a famous production of Hamlet that happened in

00:20:41.813 --> 00:20:49.883
Romania in the late 1980s, shortly before the fall of the Romanian dictator, Nicolas Ceaușescu.

00:20:50.483 --> 00:20:55.343
Although this was a police state and the dictator’s secret police generally

00:20:55.513 --> 00:21:00.913
had an iron grip on anything that was staged, shown or published, this

00:21:00.923 --> 00:21:05.923
production of Hamlet managed to escape censorship - or being banned.

00:21:06.983 --> 00:21:13.643
The high status of Shakespeare meant that the state authorities did not want to seem ignorant or

00:21:13.653 --> 00:21:20.663
stupid; they probably also thought the play was safe because it was about events along time ago.

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:27.683
In fact, Hamlet, dealing as it does with a corrupt, authoritarian state

00:21:27.743 --> 00:21:32.813
and the silencing of truth by a killer, is an intensely political play.

00:21:33.863 --> 00:21:37.833
The audiences could see the links with their own, desperate

00:21:37.843 --> 00:21:41.423
situation, living under a corrupt and nasty ruler.

00:21:42.473 --> 00:21:47.003
The play helped them feel that they were not entirely silenced and that their

00:21:47.003 --> 00:21:53.553
situation was being explored in a helpful way; the play itself was an act of rebellion.

00:21:54.848 --> 00:22:01.518
Our final example is from June of 2017 when there was a staging of Julius

00:22:01.528 --> 00:22:06.068
Caesar in the annual Shakespeare in the Park in New York’s Public Theater.

00:22:06.998 --> 00:22:13.988
This play has at its centre the assassination or public killing of the Roman emperor, Julius Caesar.

00:22:14.988 --> 00:22:19.838
It is also a play about political power and its dangers or perils.

00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:27.298
As you can imagine, with Donald Trump being the relatively newly elected president and the

00:22:27.298 --> 00:22:34.478
USA bitterly divided, this dramatisation of Julius Caesar could not avoid being political.

00:22:35.388 --> 00:22:41.008
The famous Roman was given various Trump-like characteristics, such as a

00:22:41.008 --> 00:22:46.328
large red tie and a baseball hat, and a wife with an eastern European accent.

00:22:47.348 --> 00:22:53.038
As you probably know, the assassination of Caesar through stabbing is bloody and shocking.

00:22:53.738 --> 00:22:59.648
Performances at the theatre became hot-tempered, with protests by pro-Trump supporters.

00:23:00.458 --> 00:23:06.538
Right wing-leaning sponsors withdrew their sponsorship in protest, but the play went ahead.

00:23:07.318 --> 00:23:10.268
Whoever said that theatre was boring or uneventful?

00:23:11.238 --> 00:23:16.328
So there we are - an author and a playwright for all of us - and for all time.

00:23:17.138 --> 00:23:21.622
If you come to England, there are lots of ways to feel close to the Bard.

00:23:22.849 --> 00:23:25.818
A visit to the Globe Theatre in London is probably one of the best.

00:23:26.768 --> 00:23:31.468
The original theatre burned down in a fire in 1613, but it

00:23:31.468 --> 00:23:35.228
has been recreated in exactly the same style as the original.

00:23:35.748 --> 00:23:40.228
You can even be a groundling, and buy a ticket to stand right next to the stage.

00:23:41.328 --> 00:23:46.468
So, go to The Globe, enjoy one of these timeless performances, and you can

00:23:46.468 --> 00:23:51.318
decide for yourself whether he really is Our Greatest Living Playwright.

00:23:53.948 --> 00:23:59.438
Ok then, that is it for today's episode on the genius of William Shakespeare.

00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:04.618
There are many people who live their lives speaking English very happily without the

00:24:04.628 --> 00:24:10.328
slightest idea about Shakespeare, but using words and phrases that he gave to the language.

00:24:11.208 --> 00:24:16.118
So, I am glad that you now know a little bit more about this man’s amazing legacy,

00:24:16.378 --> 00:24:20.808
his fantastic life, and his marvellous contributions to the English language.

00:24:21.378 --> 00:24:25.318
As I mentioned, there will be an article on the blog with an extended list of

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:29.698
his contributions to English, so do go and check that out if it’s of interest.

00:24:30.788 --> 00:24:36.718
Of course, the absolute best way to get under the skin of William Shakespeare is to read him.

00:24:37.678 --> 00:24:41.328
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

How is Shakespeare taught, if at all, in your country?

00:24:44.538 --> 00:24:45.998
Did you study it at school?

00:24:46.508 --> 00:24:48.538
If so, what did you think?

00:24:48.968 --> 00:24:52.978

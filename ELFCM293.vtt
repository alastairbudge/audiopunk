Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:17.107
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:21.347
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:29.167
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:36.157
This episode is going to be released on August 30th of 2022, almost exactly

00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:40.687
a year to the day since the United States officially left Afghanistan.

00:00:41.387 --> 00:00:45.447
You may well remember the pictures from the last day of the withdrawal,

00:00:45.707 --> 00:00:50.897
as people frantically struggled to get onto planes and fly out of Kabul.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:57.727
But you may now know the story behind the occupation, and how the events of

00:00:57.777 --> 00:01:02.953
August the 30th were just the end of a long and protracted withdrawal from the

00:01:02.953 --> 00:01:08.603
country, and how the return of the Taliban was, to some, utterly predictable.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.843
OK then, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:19.979
As the departure date approached, the international community watched nervously.

00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:25.653
Many were concerned that the US exit was too rushed, it was too quick.

00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:29.373
These fears were quickly confirmed.

00:01:29.723 --> 00:01:36.403
As the US forces prepared for their departure, Afghanistan broke out in a civil war.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:41.803
The Taliban, the Islamist group that the US had removed from power

00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:45.733
when they first invaded Afghanistan, were waiting in the shadows.

00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:51.420
Politicians, foreign diplomats, reporters, and ordinary citizens

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:56.383
scrambled to escape, fearing for their lives under a Taliban takeover.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:02:03.863
Although the revival of the Taliban shocked many, to others it was not a surprise in the slightest.

00:02:04.773 --> 00:02:10.567
Now, to understand the events of  August the 30th of 2021, we need to

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:16.017
first remind ourselves exactly what the US was doing in Afghanistan in

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:20.057
the first place, a country literally on the other side of the world.

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:27.717
This can, of course, all be traced back to one day, September 11th of 2001.

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:31.836
It would be on this day that the terror group al-Qaeda

00:02:32.316 --> 00:02:36.066
mounted the deadliest ever terror attacks on US soil.

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:39.186
Multiple airlines were hijacked mid-flight.

00:02:39.786 --> 00:02:43.896
Two were flown into the Twin Tower skyscrapers in New York.

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:50.216
The attacks had been masterminded by Osama bin Laden, a militant Islamist leader

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:55.006
who operated a terror training base in the remote mountains of Afghanistan.

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:57.536
President George W.

00:02:57.536 --> 00:03:03.076
Bush announced a new global operation to root out anti-Western extremists.

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:06.786
The so-called “War on Terror” had begun.

00:03:08.326 --> 00:03:13.416
Their first objective was to bring bin Laden to justice for the 9/11 attacks.

00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:18.356
The US demanded the Taliban government in Afghanistan to hand

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:23.386
him over and when the Taliban refused, the US declared war.

00:03:24.184 --> 00:03:30.136
On October 7th of 2001, the US and its NATO allies invaded Afghanistan.

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:35.026
And as you will remember, the US victory was swift.

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:42.266
In just two months, they drove out the Taliban government and captured the capital city of Kabul.

00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:48.576
The invasion ended the seven-year reign of the Taliban and in the early months

00:03:48.596 --> 00:03:53.536
of the war it seemed that the group could never return to power in Afghanistan.

00:03:54.606 --> 00:04:00.876
Now, as a quick reminder of who the Taliban actually are and where they come from, the

00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:09.904
group can trace its roots back to another Afghan war, the Soviet-Afghan war of 1979 to 1992.

00:04:11.046 --> 00:04:18.496
After the Soviets had been pushed out of Afghanistan in 1992, this Islamist group, the Taliban,

00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:25.036
which literally means “the students” in Pashto, rose to dominance in the war-torn country.

00:04:26.296 --> 00:04:30.406
By 1996, they had captured the government of Afghanistan.

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:34.226
The Taliban was not just opposed to Communism.

00:04:34.686 --> 00:04:39.436
They also condemned liberalism and any form of secular culture.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:45.106
Their rise to power did nothing to deradicalise or demilitarise them.

00:04:46.446 --> 00:04:50.266
True to their fundamentalist roots, they implemented an

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:53.956
extreme interpretation of Islamic laws throughout the country.

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:56.576
Women could not attend school.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:59.316
Adultery was punishable by death.

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:04.146
They also maintained close ties to extremist anti-Western

00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:07.426
terror groups, including Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda.

00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:14.316
Their rule would last until 2001, when they were easily defeated by the US.

00:05:15.696 --> 00:05:20.426
For the Americans though, the military victory was only the beginning.

00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:27.136
They wanted to install a pro-Western democratic political system in Afghanistan to

00:05:27.136 --> 00:05:32.336
make sure that the country could never again become a hideout for Islamist terrorists.

00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:41.176
To achieve this, the US pursued what it called a ‘hearts and minds’ strategy, an approach to

00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:48.156
governance that would warm the population to Western ideals and draw them away from Islamist values.

00:05:49.056 --> 00:05:55.746
For the next twenty years, they built schools, dug wells, and gave agricultural training to farmers.

00:05:56.156 --> 00:06:00.366
They hoped this would be enough to affect a wholescale cultural transformation.

00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:06.407
The US poured troops and money into the Hearts and Minds strategy but, as the

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:12.147
events of last August made evident, this strategy had not worked as planned.

00:06:13.147 --> 00:06:18.757
The Taliban may have been pushed out of government, but they were far from disbanded.

00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:24.987
They continued to fight the Western invaders, targeting areas that were receiving Western

00:06:24.997 --> 00:06:31.177
aid by mounting ambushes and laying improvised explosive devices, bombs essentially.

00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:36.387
If the local Afghans were starting to support the new Western-backed

00:06:36.407 --> 00:06:40.007
government, the Taliban would even turn to killing civilians.

00:06:40.967 --> 00:06:47.407
Afghanistan soon turned into a military, financial, and political mess for the United States.

00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:54.517
Over a 20-year period, an estimated $2.3 trillion was spent on the war.

00:06:55.157 --> 00:07:01.937
Over 2,000 US military personnel and almost 4,000 military contractors were killed.

00:07:02.737 --> 00:07:07.427
On the Afghan side, almost 50,000 civilians had lost their lives.

00:07:08.747 --> 00:07:14.197
The more that the US forces tried to win over the country to democratic ideals and

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:19.397
the new Western-backed regime, the more pushback they experienced from the Taliban.

00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:24.107
There seemed to be no end in sight to the occupation until

00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:28.247
the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016.

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:32.807
During his election campaign, he had promised to reduce the

00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:36.897
US’ foreign military presence and focus on domestic issues.

00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:42.877
In 2019, he took the first step towards a full withdrawal.

00:07:43.487 --> 00:07:49.487
He reduced US troops in Afghanistan from 14,000 to 4,500, down

00:07:49.617 --> 00:07:53.497
from about 100,000 at the height of the US presence in the country.

00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:56.127
But some were worried.

00:07:56.527 --> 00:08:01.127
Many in Western military intelligence warned that the country would plunge

00:08:01.157 --> 00:08:06.527
into chaos without the backing of the United States, believing that the US

00:08:06.557 --> 00:08:11.277
and the Afghan government had never truly brought the Taliban under control.

00:08:12.007 --> 00:08:16.697
The group had simply retreated to the rural provinces where they continued to

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:21.547
resist the occupiers and the government, simply waiting for the right moment.

00:08:22.887 --> 00:08:28.617
And as much as the Trump administration wanted to wash its hands of this endless

00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:34.084
occupation, it wanted to do so without leaving a complete bloodbath in its wake.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:40.354
This is why, in the months leading up to the withdrawal, Washington piled

00:08:40.374 --> 00:08:45.894
pressure on the Taliban and Afghan government to come to a peaceful agreement.

00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:50.404
The US wanted the two groups to enter a power-sharing

00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:53.084
deal to push the country through the withdrawal.

00:08:53.784 --> 00:08:56.704
After this, there would be a national election.

00:08:57.874 --> 00:09:03.654
But the Afghan government resisted making deals with their sworn enemy, the Taliban.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.794
This is, of course, understandable.

00:09:07.494 --> 00:09:12.154
After more than a decade of being supported by the West to destroy the

00:09:12.154 --> 00:09:16.704
Taliban’s power base, they were now being pressured to join hands with them.

00:09:18.234 --> 00:09:25.208
Then, on February 29th of 2020, Trump signed a peace deal with the Taliban in Doha, Qatar.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:31.133
The conditions were that they would stop attacking US personnel and supporting al-Qaeda.

00:09:31.983 --> 00:09:37.333
In return, the US would complete their withdrawal by May of 2021.

00:09:38.793 --> 00:09:44.793
The promise of a US withdrawal emboldened the Taliban, it made them feel more confident.

00:09:45.513 --> 00:09:49.273
Although they did stop attacking the US and its allies, they

00:09:49.273 --> 00:09:52.963
intensified their attacks against Afghan security forces.

00:09:53.683 --> 00:09:58.863
There was a 70 percent increase in Taliban attacks on the government in the 45 days

00:09:59.013 --> 00:10:05.023
after the February 2020 US-al-Qaeda deal compared to the same period the previous year.

00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:12.705
This deterioration, understandably again, made many in the US government nervous.

00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:18.205
In January of 2021, Joe Biden took over from Trump as

00:10:18.205 --> 00:10:22.025
president and he did stick to the basic withdrawal commitment.

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:27.015
The only thing he changed was that the withdrawal would be complete later,

00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:32.188
by the end of August rather than in May, as Trump had originally promised.

00:10:33.328 --> 00:10:38.858
At this point, in anticipation of a US exit, the Taliban swept through

00:10:38.928 --> 00:10:43.588
Afghan provinces with a speed that shocked even experienced observers.

00:10:43.948 --> 00:10:46.608
The whole country broke out in panic.

00:10:47.698 --> 00:10:51.608
The Afghan government urged volunteers to arm themselves.

00:10:51.788 --> 00:10:55.088
They even solicited support from prominent warlords that

00:10:55.088 --> 00:10:58.308
had moved abroad to come back and defend the government.

00:10:59.798 --> 00:11:07.288
In April of 2021, civilian casualties were up 29 percent compared to the same period in 2020.

00:11:07.898 --> 00:11:10.838
The majority of these were from Taliban attacks.

00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:18.409
And on the US side, the United States administration was still divided over withdrawal.

00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:25.649
The only advantage that Kabul, that the Afghan government, held over the Taliban was its air

00:11:25.649 --> 00:11:32.809
power but it relied completely on US technicians, operators, and finance for air strikes.

00:11:33.879 --> 00:11:38.238
Many thought that the US should not leave Kabul, until the Afghan

00:11:38.261 --> 00:11:42.171
government, could defend itself without relying on American forces.

00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:48.411
Even the CIA director Bill Burns told the Senate that the withdrawal

00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:52.821
would only lead to the rise of Islamic extremism in the region again.

00:11:53.611 --> 00:11:59.731
But on May 1st, the first phase of the operation to withdraw began.

00:12:00.601 --> 00:12:06.191
Throughout May, the US focused on flying key pieces of military equipment out from the country.

00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:08.761
The withdrawal was really happening.

00:12:09.701 --> 00:12:14.191
In June, Ghani, the president of Afghanistan, was on a warpath.

00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:18.891
He chose men with military experience to head his new cabinet,

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:24.021
including a prominent warlord general called Bismillah Khan Mohammadi.

00:12:25.371 --> 00:12:30.231
The sole objective was to protect Kabul and the ten largest cities in the country.

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:34.841
Some Afghan politicians started leaving the country, fearing that

00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:38.351
they would be murdered by the Taliban as Western collaborators.

00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:42.271
The Taliban weren’t exactly known for their forgiveness.

00:12:43.071 --> 00:12:48.181
The group vowed to keep fighting the Kabul government until Ghani was removed from power.

00:12:48.771 --> 00:12:53.201
They resisted the international community’s pleas for them to lay down arms.

00:12:54.601 --> 00:13:00.301
From May to July, 80 out of 400 districts in Afghanistan had fallen to

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:05.511
the Taliban who referred to themselves as the ‘Islamic Emirate’ and spoke

00:13:05.531 --> 00:13:10.591
of their intention to establish what they called a ‘pure Islamic regime’.

00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:14.801
In the areas they controlled, the Taliban were already

00:13:14.811 --> 00:13:18.871
reinstalling their extremist interpretation of Islamic governance.

00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:23.681
Reports began filtering through about the Taliban already banning women from

00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:28.591
work in the areas they controlled and publicly executing people without trial.

00:13:29.996 --> 00:13:36.326
Although their justice might have been medieval, their methods of takeover were sophisticated.

00:13:36.936 --> 00:13:41.916
They doubled down on diplomacy, getting Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan

00:13:42.146 --> 00:13:45.016
to keep trade through the border crossings that they controlled.

00:13:46.336 --> 00:13:50.796
Now that they had control over commodity flows through Afghanistan, they

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:55.286
could use this to pressure the Kabul government to give in, to surrender.

00:13:56.466 --> 00:13:59.766
Already by July, countries that bordered Afghanistan

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:02.766
were treating the Taliban as the government-in-waiting.

00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:09.066
New Delhi, India, was negotiating with them on equal terms even as they

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:13.890
nominally supported Kabul, as they supported the Western-backed government.

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:20.300
On July 3rd of 2021, the US handed over its main military

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.860
base in Afghanistan, Bagram Airfield, to the Kabul government.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.710
Not even the maintenance staff were left.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:33.820
Now, only 600 US troops were left in the whole country to protect the US diplomatic mission.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.420
Bagram had been the centre of US operations since the time of the invasion

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:45.120
so this was a major step in the withdrawal and underlined the seriousness

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.020
of the US commitment to leave the country on the planned August deadline.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.300
The second most important air base in the country, Kandahar, would be next.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:00.730
And although Biden promised one billion dollars and an additional 37

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.775
Black Hawk helicopters to Afghanistan to make up for the loss of the air

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:09.720
bases, the US had not trained the Afghans in operating air equipment.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.810
These capabilities were useless to the Kabul government

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.550
unless the US military was there to operate them.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.610
By mid-July the US withdrawal was more than 95 percent complete.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.460
In the north of Afghanistan, the warlords who had helped the US defeat

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.890
the Taliban twenty years ago were once again battling the Islamist group.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:38.430
The Taliban were assaulting the city of Kandahar in the south and Wala-e-Naw in the North West.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.850
The Taliban knew that they were winning.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.390
They had been waiting for twenty years, and now they simply had to wait for a few more weeks.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:56.790
By early August, almost 300,000 Afghans had fled their homes, anticipating the Taliban advance.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.370
These internal refugees descended on the large cities,

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.300
the last strongholds of the government’s power.

00:16:05.697 --> 00:16:10.447
Now, the Taliban controlled more than half of Afghanistan’s 400 districts.

00:16:11.257 --> 00:16:15.507
They hadn’t yet captured Kabul, but they were quickly encircling the capital.

00:16:16.697 --> 00:16:21.927
In foreign embassies, people were trying to find reliable sources of food and petrol.

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:24.737
There was a mad rush to escape.

00:16:25.157 --> 00:16:29.347
With the Taliban closing in, the only place where foreign nationals and

00:16:29.427 --> 00:16:33.317
diplomats could guarantee their safety was Kabul’s International Airport.

00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:37.697
However, many American citizens could not reach this

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:40.897
secure zone as the routes into it were so dangerous.

00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:46.987
International news crews descended onto the airport to record the final

00:16:46.987 --> 00:16:51.493
flights out of this war-torn nation, and there were eerie parallels

00:16:51.583 --> 00:16:55.875
with the United States’ withdrawal from Saigon in April of 1975.

00:16:57.143 --> 00:17:00.823
The disorder and urgency that they found there became

00:17:00.823 --> 00:17:04.203
a symbol of the US’ mishandling of their departure.

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:09.113
The US Air Force was flying aircraft into and out of Kabul every

00:17:09.113 --> 00:17:13.873
24 hours filled with US citizens and eligible Afghan refugees.

00:17:14.863 --> 00:17:18.293
And, the stream of evacuees kept coming.

00:17:18.803 --> 00:17:23.743
At this stage, the US was trying to evacuate 9,000 people a day from

00:17:23.743 --> 00:17:28.193
the country and the few remaining military personnel were overwhelmed.

00:17:29.213 --> 00:17:33.683
On August 16th, Afghans desperate to flee the Taliban ran

00:17:33.693 --> 00:17:37.333
onto the airport’s tiny airstrip, following a moving plane.

00:17:38.113 --> 00:17:41.473
Some people were so desperate to escape that they fell

00:17:41.473 --> 00:17:44.333
to their deaths after hanging off the wheels of planes.

00:17:45.318 --> 00:17:54.017
On August 26th, two suicide bombers and gunmen killed 60 Afghans and 12 US troops at the airport.

00:17:54.637 --> 00:18:00.477
This was the largest number of US military troops killed in Afghanistan since 2011.

00:18:01.487 --> 00:18:06.527
But Joe Biden remained committed to the withdrawal, now only one week away.

00:18:07.357 --> 00:18:10.377
Afghan leaders, he said, had to fight for themselves.

00:18:11.487 --> 00:18:18.180
And at 11:59pm on August the 30th the last US military planes finally left

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:23.050
Kabul airport, drawing a line under the 20-year occupation of the country.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.970
Afghanistan was, yet again, under Taliban control.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:35.750
The hope for a peaceful transition seems naïve looking back, but the US government had

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:41.840
not been the only one who still clung to optimism about an independent Afghanistan.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.190
Even experienced reporters familiar with the country were shocked

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.314
by how quickly the Taliban took back power in August 2021.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:58.900
Many had truly believed that Afghanistan had been transformed under the new, Western-backed regime.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.540
The Afghanistan that many reporters were familiar with seemed to confirm the idea

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.270
that the country had undergone a profound cultural shift during the occupation.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:17.520
In their bases in cities like Kandahar and Kabul, they would have seen a university educated

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:24.610
urban population that now included women, people with office jobs, private sector or NGOs.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.600
Many young people had never known Taliban rule.

00:19:30.053 --> 00:19:34.873
For these observers, it is understandable that they would have believed that there

00:19:34.903 --> 00:19:39.753
could be no way that the nation would return to rule by an extremist militia who

00:19:39.863 --> 00:19:44.623
imposed the most fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law on their population.

00:19:46.013 --> 00:19:49.553
For the Taliban, however, things looked very different.

00:19:50.483 --> 00:19:53.893
For 20 years, the Taliban had been ready to take back

00:19:53.973 --> 00:19:56.783
Afghanistan when the opportunity presented itself.

00:19:57.443 --> 00:20:01.503
They knew the opportunity would come, and they saw that there were

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:05.253
deep structural problems with the Western occupation of the country.

00:20:06.003 --> 00:20:11.023
For many reasons, the US-backed regime in Kabul was very fragile.

00:20:11.553 --> 00:20:16.483
Not only did the country’s economy depend on massive amounts of foreign aid from the

00:20:16.483 --> 00:20:22.683
West, but the Kabul government actually had very shallow roots in wider Afghan society.

00:20:23.603 --> 00:20:29.253
After the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, the country was deeply divided.

00:20:30.223 --> 00:20:35.663
From the perspective of white-collar professionals and businessmen in Kabul, it was easy to

00:20:35.663 --> 00:20:41.893
forget that 80 percent of Afghans are involved in agriculture, they’re farmers, essentially.

00:20:42.903 --> 00:20:47.223
The Taliban controlled many rural provinces even back in 2020.

00:20:47.913 --> 00:20:52.443
Many other provinces were only weakly under the control of government’s forces.

00:20:53.113 --> 00:20:58.643
This was partly because after the US invasion, many Afghans who had once opposed

00:20:58.643 --> 00:21:03.713
the Taliban’s harsh regime had quickly become sceptical of the US-backed government.

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:10.813
This was especially the case among Pashtuns, a major ethnic group in Afghanistan.

00:21:11.923 --> 00:21:16.613
Pashtun people thought that the US-backed government was too dominated by

00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:21.393
Tajiks, an ethnic group that had historically been hostile to the Pashtuns.

00:21:22.173 --> 00:21:27.083
There was a lot of mistrust and it didn’t help that the Tajik-dominated

00:21:27.083 --> 00:21:31.393
government would raid, bomb, and detain Pashtun tribe members.

00:21:32.173 --> 00:21:36.713
These discriminatory policies made the Taliban, whose leadership

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:40.774
and founding members were mostly Pashtuns, more appealing to some.

00:21:42.086 --> 00:21:45.673
And, unsurprisingly, the Taliban found it quite easy

00:21:45.813 --> 00:21:48.523
to take control of districts where Pashtuns lived.

00:21:49.563 --> 00:21:53.113
So, Afghan opinion of the Taliban is complex.

00:21:53.573 --> 00:21:57.773
And clearly, not everyone who ended up supporting their resurgence

00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:02.433
was motivated by purely ideological or theological reasons.

00:22:03.303 --> 00:22:08.923
For many, it was simply practical, it was a case of survival, to not oppose the Taliban.

00:22:10.033 --> 00:22:13.363
And this was especially true outside the cities.

00:22:14.303 --> 00:22:19.893
For years, the Taliban had proven themselves competent administrators in the rural regions.

00:22:20.353 --> 00:22:23.263
They had stepped into places where the central government

00:22:23.453 --> 00:22:26.803
had either been too corrupt or unpopular to govern.

00:22:27.603 --> 00:22:31.863
This didn’t just make the population see them as legitimate rulers.

00:22:32.043 --> 00:22:33.643
It also made them a lot of money.

00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:40.633
They controlled the lucrative poppy trade but also made their wealth from more legitimate sources.

00:22:41.603 --> 00:22:46.023
In return for providing security in parts of the country where the government had lost

00:22:46.043 --> 00:22:51.903
control, the Taliban took taxes on commodities like fuel that passed through their territories.

00:22:52.923 --> 00:22:57.093
The Taliban takeover was ultimately financed by this wealth.

00:22:57.813 --> 00:23:01.243
Even as fighting intensified in August, the Taliban

00:23:01.243 --> 00:23:04.503
made sure that their tax revenue would not be disrupted.

00:23:05.783 --> 00:23:10.433
In a shrewd move, they prioritised capturing strategic economic positions.

00:23:10.893 --> 00:23:17.033
They took over key border posts, which ensured that trade and business continued and that

00:23:17.093 --> 00:23:21.893
the tax revenue which would have been sent to Kabul was going to the Taliban instead.

00:23:23.083 --> 00:23:28.263
Now, looking at Afghanistan in 2022, it’s easy to

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:31.263
think that the last twenty years had never happened.

00:23:32.053 --> 00:23:38.473
Despite two decades of propaganda efforts and aid by the US and its allies, the Western-backed

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:43.963
regime had failed to win the hearts and minds of the population outside the urban centres.

00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:49.648
The tragedy of the Afghan situation is that by 2021,

00:23:50.043 --> 00:23:54.213
the US had few options other than to fully withdraw.

00:23:55.353 --> 00:23:59.623
By then, it was impossible to correct the blunders of the US and

00:23:59.623 --> 00:24:03.583
NATO occupation without staying on in the country for decades more.

00:24:04.763 --> 00:24:10.513
And the West, especially the United States, was no longer in the business of nation-building.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:17.633
Afghanistan had, yet again, lived up to its nickname as a “graveyard of empires”.

00:24:18.613 --> 00:24:22.063
In the 19th century the British and the Russians fought “The

00:24:22.183 --> 00:24:25.973
Great Game” in Afghanistan, with both losing spectacularly.

00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:30.773
In the 21st century, even the richest and most powerful country in the

00:24:30.773 --> 00:24:35.503
world would join this list of foreign invaders that “lost” in Afghanistan.

00:24:36.603 --> 00:24:40.003
But of course, as with any conflict, it is not the

00:24:40.003 --> 00:24:43.243
invaders, but the ordinary civilians that suffer the most.

00:24:44.153 --> 00:24:49.193
When international organisations and the US cut off aid and financial loans to

00:24:49.343 --> 00:24:54.203
Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, its economic and social services began collapsing.

00:24:54.953 --> 00:24:59.643
In May 2022, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator announced

00:24:59.643 --> 00:25:03.233
that 95 percent of Afghans are not getting enough to eat.

00:25:04.683 --> 00:25:11.780
Rightly or wrongly, August the 30th of 2021 will go down as a monumentous date in the history of

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:19.180
both the United States and Afghanistan, a time when Western rule ended and Taliban rule restarted.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.270
The chapter on foreign occupation is now closed, and

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.220
a new chapter under the Taliban is just starting.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.393
Time will only tell how long, and how dangerous, this chapter will be.

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:40.783
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:44.613
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:25:45.593 --> 00:25:48.953
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:49.473 --> 00:25:56.993
Looking back on the previous 365 days, how do you think Afghanistan has fared versus expectations?

00:25:57.633 --> 00:26:00.263
What other options did the United States have?

00:26:00.743 --> 00:26:06.573
Is the region now more dangerous or is it a safer place since the United States has left?

00:26:07.103 --> 00:26:10.313
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

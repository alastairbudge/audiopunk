Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.369
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.979
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.129
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Suez Canal, the stretch

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:34.389
of water that links the Mediterranean and Red Seas, and is crucial for global trade.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.529
This was actually a request from one of your fellow members, Jáchym, who

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.729
I believe is the youngest member of Leonardo English, at 17 years old.

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:48.829
He is an awesome guy who I know has a very bright future ahead of him.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.526
So Jáchym, if you are listening, this one's for you, and thanks for this request.

00:00:56.526 --> 00:00:58.726
Ok then, let’s get started.

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:08.636
The Suez Canal, in case you need a reminder, is the 193km long canal on the eastern side of Egypt.

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:11.636
Its purpose is obvious.

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:16.716
It allows ships to travel between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean,

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:21.076
so they don’t have to go all the way around the coast of Africa.

00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:27.756
This, naturally, reduces the distance that ships have to travel by a huge amount.

00:01:28.456 --> 00:01:32.836
To be precise, going through the Suez Canal reduces the

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:39.066
distance between the Arabian Sea and London by 8,900 km.

00:01:40.026 --> 00:01:43.096
So why it exists might seem obvious.

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:47.866
It isn’t just obvious to us, in the era of global trade.

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:50.586
It has been obvious for millennia.

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:56.686
Indeed, there have been attempts to connect the Red Sea to the Mediterrannean

00:01:57.086 --> 00:02:02.536
that can be traced back to the pharaohs, traced back to ancient Egypt.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:09.286
The ancient Egyptians were, as the pyramids are testament to, pretty accomplished

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:14.786
engineers, and they actually managed to create a system of canals that

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:19.906
connected the Red Sea with the River Nile, which ends up in the Mediterranean.

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:24.592
So they did manage to connect the two back in the

00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:29.756
early second millennium BC, so almost 4,000 years ago.

00:02:31.146 --> 00:02:37.746
These early canals were quite basic, but lasted right up until the 8th century AD, so

00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:47.216
the Suez Canal needs to last about another 2,700 years or so to outlive its predecessors.

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:53.616
In any case, the benefit of joining up these two bodies of water was clear.

00:02:54.406 --> 00:03:01.926
Carrying goods, soldiers, oil, or whatever it is, is normally easier and cheaper on a ship,

00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:09.086
and being able to link together Europe and Asia would be beneficial for pretty much everyone.

00:03:10.326 --> 00:03:15.936
The idea of creating an actual canal though, as opposed to small canals

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:20.566
that link up to the Nile, has attracted merchants throughout the centuries.

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:26.976
As European countries started to colonise parts of Africa and Asia,

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:33.466
especially the British in India, this idea of having a ‘shortcut’ to

00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:39.036
bring goods back from its crown jewel was understandably attractive.

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.819
The Venetians, the merchants from Venice, were also very excited about

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:50.319
it, as it would have given them a big advantage over the Dutch or the

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.629
British, as Venice would have suddenly got a lot closer to the Orient.

00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:01.769
However it wasn’t until Napoleon Bonaparte’s campaign in Egypt in

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:08.139
1798 that the idea of actually doing it started to gain traction.

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:15.871
Engineers were shipped over from France, studies were carried out, and measurements were taken.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:23.264
If the French could have created this canal, it would have meant that access to the East was opened

00:04:23.264 --> 00:04:30.394
up, and it would have been easier for France, and other European powers, to compete with Britain.

00:04:31.634 --> 00:04:37.294
However, when the French engineers conducted their surveys, they came to the conclusion

00:04:37.634 --> 00:04:42.384
that the water level of the Red Sea was 10 metres higher than the Mediterranean.

00:04:43.304 --> 00:04:50.084
This meant that they would have had to build locks, the sort of gate systems that allow ships

00:04:50.084 --> 00:04:56.594
to climb up, and this would have made construction more difficult and much more expensive.

00:04:57.374 --> 00:04:59.534
So the plan was abandoned.

00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:05.394
However, it turned out that the French engineers had made a mistake.

00:05:06.554 --> 00:05:12.704
The Red Sea was higher than the Mediterranean, but not by as much as the engineers had thought.

00:05:13.314 --> 00:05:18.509
It was only 1 metre higher, which meant that no locks would need to be constructed.

00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:27.219
Unfortunately this was only discovered decades later, in 1846, but the Egyptians didn’t

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:33.789
immediately like the sound of the project, and it took another 8 years for them to agree to it.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.939
So, in 1854 all systems were go.

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:46.109
A company was to be set up, and it would be jointly owned by the French and the Egyptians.

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:52.319
The idea was that this company would own the rights to operate the canal

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:58.549
for 99 years, and then it would be handed back over to the Egyptians.

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:03.329
Construction of the canal started in 1859.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:09.269
It was planned to only take 6 years, but ended up taking 10.

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.649
There were a few reasons for this.

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:21.499
Firstly, instead of using industrial equipment, they started by using Egyptian peasants, who were

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:30.709
essentially forced to work on excavating the canal, to dig this huge, almost 200km long trench.

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:37.699
They were forced to do this with very basic tools, right in the middle of a desert.

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.679
You can imagine that these must have been horrendous conditions to work in.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:50.059
It’s estimated that one and a half million people worked on the project, and

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:57.879
tens of thousands died while slaving away to dig this monument to global trade.

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:03.059
There was also a cholera epidemic which wiped out a large

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:06.579
amount of the workforce, and greatly slowed things down.

00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:14.919
Later on, these Egyptian peasants were replaced with European labourers, but instead

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:21.459
of sweltering away in the heat, they operated mechanical trucks, and diggers.

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:28.209
Not only was this a lot more bearable, but it was a lot more efficient,

00:07:28.679 --> 00:07:34.429
and finally, after 10 years instead of 6, the canal was finished.

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.039
Interestingly enough, you might have thought that the canal would

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:43.959
take the shortest route between the two seas, but it doesn’t.

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:52.089
The shortest route is only 121 km, but the canal is 193km long.

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:59.039
The reason for this is that the route uses some lakes, which - even though

00:07:59.099 --> 00:08:04.139
it means the total distance is a bit longer - it made construction easier.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:12.385
So, this takes us to 1869, and finally, the dream of the pharaohs,

00:08:12.665 --> 00:08:17.845
Venetian merchants, and almost every trader in the world was realised.

00:08:18.905 --> 00:08:22.495
The Suez canal was a marvel of modern technology.

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:28.925
It might have looked just like a river, but it now linked up Europe and the East.

00:08:29.815 --> 00:08:35.615
When it was first opened, it was actually quite small though, just 8 metres

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:43.565
deep, 22 metres wide at the bottom and between 60 and 90 metres wide at the top.

00:08:44.095 --> 00:08:45.395
Not exactly massive.

00:08:46.055 --> 00:08:51.925
Indeed, for the first few years of its existence, lots of ships got stuck.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:57.745
It was too thin, which made it difficult to navigate, and improvements

00:08:57.745 --> 00:09:04.055
were made to widen and deepen it to stop the ships getting stuck.

00:09:04.075 --> 00:09:10.015
Despite this being a great coup for Egypt, now the proud partial owners of

00:09:10.015 --> 00:09:15.680
a brilliant example of modern civil engineering, the Egyptian government ran

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:20.970
into financial difficulties, and was forced to sell its share in the canal.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.470
And who did they sell it to?

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.990
Well, they sold it to the British.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:33.280
In 1875 the British government bought the Egyptians' 44% share of the

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.180
Suez Canal company for today’s equivalent of around $550 million dollars.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:45.760
Quite a steal for almost half of one of the most valuable stretches of water on the planet.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.220
Britain, as you might expect, started to use its ownership of

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:56.580
the canal to exert its authority and push the Egyptians around.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:03.630
It now owned a valuable asset in the middle of Egypt, and when there were disturbances

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:12.919
along the canal in 1882, Britain used this as an excuse to invade and occupy Egypt,

00:10:13.309 --> 00:10:19.239
essentially turning it into an unofficial British colony, which it remained until 1956.

00:10:21.407 --> 00:10:23.057
So, back to the Suez Canal.

00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:26.487
As the world had continued to be more and more

00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:30.607
globalised, more interconnected, its importance increased.

00:10:31.557 --> 00:10:36.247
Oil had been discovered in the Middle East in the early 20th century, and the

00:10:36.247 --> 00:10:41.657
Suez Canal was a vital part of the trade route between the Middle East and Europe.

00:10:42.287 --> 00:10:47.837
Nationalism had been growing in Egypt, and the Egyptians became more and more

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:52.897
aware of the increasing value of this asset that fell within their borders.

00:10:54.027 --> 00:10:59.987
The British and the French owners of the canal were reluctant to give power over

00:11:00.037 --> 00:11:06.127
to the Egyptians, or to train the Egyptian workforce, and there was increasing

00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:11.877
animosity between the European and the Egyptian staff of the Suez Canal company.

00:11:12.767 --> 00:11:18.077
In the years after the Second World War, Egypt also showed signs of being

00:11:18.317 --> 00:11:24.197
receptive to communism, which worried the canal’s British and French owners.

00:11:25.217 --> 00:11:31.367
The President of Egypt at the time, President Nasser, was also planning to construct a huge

00:11:31.367 --> 00:11:38.687
dam in the Nile, the Aswan Dam, and he had asked for American financing to help build it.

00:11:39.457 --> 00:11:43.547
The United States refused, partially because there was this

00:11:43.567 --> 00:11:47.067
possibility of Egypt forming an alliance with the Soviet Union.

00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:52.657
With no way to finance this huge project, President Nasser turned

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:57.247
to the main source of foreign capital in Egypt - the Suez Canal.

00:11:58.127 --> 00:12:05.407
In 1956 he nationalised the canal, declaring that it was now property of the Egyptian state,

00:12:05.737 --> 00:12:12.597
and he planned to use the revenue that the canal generated as a way of financing the Aswan dam.

00:12:14.017 --> 00:12:20.147
We hadn’t mentioned this yet, but of course, ships had to pay a lot of money to use the Suez Canal.

00:12:20.717 --> 00:12:24.117
Don’t worry, we’ll talk about this in much more detail in a few minutes.

00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:30.071
So, President Nasser declared the Suez Canal company to be property of

00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:35.481
the Egyptian state, and for good measure he also closed the Straits of

00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:41.361
Tiran to Israel, essentially closing access to the Suez Canal to Israel.

00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:48.751
As you might imagine, the British and the French, who were the legal owners of the company, didn’t

00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:55.311
take this well, and they did what European powers did back then when things didn’t go their way.

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:58.241
Together with Israel, they hatched a plan.

00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:06.961
Israel invaded first, on 29th October 1956, and then French and British troops

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:12.751
joined a week later, sparking what came to be known as “The Suez Crisis”.

00:13:13.611 --> 00:13:17.761
The Egyptian forces were quickly defeated from a military point of view.

00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:22.701
The Israeli, British and French were far more organised

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.111
and had better weapons, so it wasn’t much of a fight.

00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:33.131
However, the Egyptians blocked the canal at both ends by laying mines, by

00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:38.221
putting explosives down, and by sinking ships, to block the whole canal.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:45.308
While the British and French may have taken back control of the canal, it was completely useless.

00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:50.012
This episode sparked an international crisis, and the

00:13:50.022 --> 00:13:53.582
British and French were condemned for their aggression.

00:13:54.412 --> 00:13:58.752
This was right in the middle of the Cold War, when the West had been

00:13:58.752 --> 00:14:03.432
condemning the Soviet Union for marching in and invading countries.

00:14:04.082 --> 00:14:10.022
How could it be taken seriously when two of the most powerful Western countries, Britain

00:14:10.042 --> 00:14:15.812
and France, were doing exactly what the West had been condemning the Soviet Union for?

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:21.502
The United Nations intervened, and the Israeli, British and French

00:14:21.502 --> 00:14:26.632
troops withdrew from Egypt, but the damage to their reputation was done.

00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:32.212
Ownership of the canal returned to the Egyptians, and the three

00:14:32.232 --> 00:14:36.372
invading powers went home with their tails between their legs.

00:14:37.342 --> 00:14:41.402
The sunk ships and mines that were blocking the canal were

00:14:41.432 --> 00:14:45.812
removed, and the canal was once more open for business.

00:14:46.442 --> 00:14:51.672
This wasn’t to be the last crisis for the Suez canal though, and it was closed

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:58.522
for a 10 year period after the Six-Day War between Israel and Egypt in 1967.

00:14:59.272 --> 00:15:03.432
We’re not going to talk about this at length here, but one interesting

00:15:03.432 --> 00:15:08.262
thing about it is that when the war broke out there were ships going

00:15:08.272 --> 00:15:13.172
through the Suez canal which got stranded, they were stuck in the middle.

00:15:14.042 --> 00:15:19.102
They weren’t just stuck in the middle for a few days though, they got stuck

00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:26.032
there for 10 years, earning them the nickname of the Yellow Fleet, because

00:15:26.232 --> 00:15:30.412
they were so covered in dust from the nearby desert that they looked yellow.

00:15:31.368 --> 00:15:38.648
Fast forward half a century, and the Suez canal today still plays a vital role in global trade.

00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:44.998
It has now been expanded so that ships can go in both directions at the same

00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:52.388
time, and in 2019 it hit an all time record of the number of ships passing

00:15:52.388 --> 00:15:59.678
through, at 71 in a day, carrying a total of 21 million tonnes of goods.

00:16:00.218 --> 00:16:05.298
About 8% of all the world’s sea trade passes through the Suez canal,

00:16:05.778 --> 00:16:09.488
generating a huge amount of money for the Egyptian government.

00:16:10.458 --> 00:16:15.778
Now, one thing that we haven’t properly talked about is how much it actually costs to

00:16:15.778 --> 00:16:20.458
go through the Suez canal, and if you’ve been waiting for that part, the wait is over.

00:16:21.578 --> 00:16:25.848
The cost of going through the canal depends on lots of things, but

00:16:25.898 --> 00:16:30.998
to simplify it it’s how big the ship is and how much it’s carrying.

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:35.268
As you might expect, the bigger and heavier, the more expensive.

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:41.038
The average cost per ship is around a quarter of a million dollars.

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:44.028
Some, of course, are a lot more than that.

00:16:45.448 --> 00:16:47.888
You might think, well, that’s a lot of money.

00:16:48.238 --> 00:16:52.118
Don’t some ships just go the long way around to try to save this?

00:16:53.028 --> 00:16:54.478
And you’d be right, actually.

00:16:54.958 --> 00:17:00.748
With falling oil prices, the Suez canal has seen a reduction of ships choosing

00:17:00.748 --> 00:17:05.428
to use it, as it can prove to be a lot cheaper to avoid it altogether.

00:17:06.288 --> 00:17:12.316
Indeed, for a ship going from the East coast of the United States to Asia it’s

00:17:12.336 --> 00:17:20.326
estimated that it costs around $465,000 to go through the Suez Canal, but going

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:28.216
the long way around, underneath South Africa could save around $235,000 per trip.

00:17:29.046 --> 00:17:34.856
When a ship owner does the calculations about how much it’ll cost them to get from A to

00:17:34.856 --> 00:17:40.746
B, it’s a question of whether the extra fuel to take the long way around is going to be

00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:45.856
more or less than the cost of taking the shortcut and paying to go through the Suez Canal.

00:17:46.746 --> 00:17:52.716
If the fuel is cheaper, evidently there’s more of an incentive to take the long way around.

00:17:53.566 --> 00:18:00.786
So, a low oil price is one threat to the Suez canal, but melting sea ice is another.

00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:07.576
As the ice melts in the Arctic Ocean and those waters become increasingly

00:18:07.616 --> 00:18:13.416
easy to navigate this becomes another option for ships going from East Asia to

00:18:13.416 --> 00:18:18.756
Europe, and if they can avoid paying a quarter of a million dollars just to go

00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:23.346
through the Suez Canal, then that’s certainly a large incentive to avoid it.

00:18:24.906 --> 00:18:30.866
The Egyptian government is acutely aware of this, and adjusts prices frequently.

00:18:31.436 --> 00:18:36.606
When the oil price goes down, so does the price for going through the Suez canal, and when

00:18:36.606 --> 00:18:41.656
the oil price goes up, you guessed it, so does the price for a ticket through the Suez canal.

00:18:42.706 --> 00:18:46.596
In fact, the Suez canal is one of Egypt’s major sources of

00:18:46.596 --> 00:18:50.276
foreign capital, without it, it would be in real trouble.

00:18:51.436 --> 00:18:54.016
So, that is the story of the Suez canal.

00:18:54.656 --> 00:18:59.596
Conceived, at least from a ‘this would be a great idea’ point of view by the

00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:05.706
Pharaohs, desired by the Venetians, engineered by the French, sold to the British,

00:19:06.986 --> 00:19:13.486
retaken by the Egyptians, and now used by everyone, it truly is a remarkable story.

00:19:15.574 --> 00:19:18.678
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode.

00:19:19.078 --> 00:19:22.488
I hope it’s been an interesting one, and you’ve learned something new

00:19:22.718 --> 00:19:27.528
about a strip of water that is of huge importance to how the world works.

00:19:28.798 --> 00:19:32.898

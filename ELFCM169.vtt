Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.530
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.080
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.800
I'm Alastair Budge and today is going to be the first of a three-part

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.999
mini-series where we are going to be looking at Mormonism and Scientology,

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.160
two very different belief systems that are often compared to one another.

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.360
They are both relatively new, fast-growing, and have their fair share of critics.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.029
Importantly, to the outside world, they are not very well understood.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.409
So, we are going to explain where they come from, what people who follow them

00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:01.370
believe, and look at some of the criticisms and questions that surround them.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.550
In part one, in today’s episode, we’ll focus on Mormonism.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.328
Then in part two we will look at Scientology.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.710
And in part three we are going to look at the two together, look at

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.119
some of the similarities between the two, and more importantly the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.990
differences, and reflect a little more on the future of these religions.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.039
I should clarify that I am neither a Mormon nor a Scientologist, and, as I hope

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.609
you have come to expect, we are going to look at both of these topics through

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.360
as unbiased a lens as possible, we are going to try to avoid passing judgment.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.289
Instead, we’ll talk about how both of these belief systems came into existence,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.119
how they have developed, and I will leave you to come to your own conclusions.

00:01:54.332 --> 00:01:57.232
Ok then, let’s jump right into it.

00:01:58.532 --> 00:02:03.322
For both Scientology and Mormonism, at the heart of the story is a

00:02:03.362 --> 00:02:09.082
powerful, charismatic leader, someone with the ability to attract others.

00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:13.912
In the case of Mormonism, this leader’s story starts

00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:17.432
when he is a young boy, and it goes something like this.

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:24.762
Joseph Smith Jr was born in 1805, in Vermont, in the United States of America.

00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:30.522
He was one of 11 children, and was brought up in a farming family

00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:34.932
of devout Christians, a family of strong Christian believers.

00:02:35.612 --> 00:02:40.132
His family struggled to make a living, and eventually moved

00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:44.012
to upstate New York, where they took out a mortgage on a farm.

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:48.112
At the time there were multiple different churches, with

00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:52.132
each preaching a slightly different version of Christianity.

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:57.272
The Smith family tested out lots of different churches,

00:02:57.652 --> 00:03:00.582
trying to find one that matched their beliefs.

00:03:01.572 --> 00:03:06.692
The young Joseph Smith, who was 12 at the time, became intensely

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:12.002
religious, but wasn’t sure what form of Christianity he should follow.

00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:18.832
One day, when he was 14 years old and out praying in a wood, he was kneeling

00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:24.902
down, praying, and he was visited by God and Jesus Christ, so the story goes.

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:32.502
The young boy, not knowing which church he should join, asked God which one he should join.

00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:36.192
God told him not to join any of them.

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:39.952
Christianity had strayed from the truth, he said.

00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:45.772
The Christianity that was currently being preached wasn’t the true word of God.

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:51.772
Three years later, when he was only 17, Joseph was visited

00:03:51.942 --> 00:03:55.732
by another religious figure, an angel named Moroni.

00:03:56.782 --> 00:04:04.022
This angel told Joseph about the existence of a book written on golden plates, a book that

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:11.772
told the story of a group of Israelites who had settled in the Americas in around 600BC, a good

00:04:11.982 --> 00:04:16.912
two thousand years before anyone is believed to have travelled from Europe to the Americas.

00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:22.812
Joseph tried to go and uncover this golden book, but he was prevented by the angel.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:28.242
He kept trying every year for four years, and it was only on the

00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:32.902
last attempt, four years after he had first learned of its existence,

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:36.722
that he was able to retrieve these golden plates from the ground.

00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:43.542
On them he found a text written in an ancient Egyptian language, which of course

00:04:43.642 --> 00:04:49.672
Joseph Smith Junior, being a 22 year old American didn't have the power to understand.

00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:55.091
But, luckily he was given special powers to translate the text, a total

00:04:55.091 --> 00:05:02.541
of 531 pages, which he did in just 65 days, according to Mormon scholars.

00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:06.801
After the translation was completed, these plates were

00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:09.401
buried, and they have never been discovered again.

00:05:10.281 --> 00:05:14.691
Importantly, very few people actually saw these golden plates.

00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:19.831
There were around 11 eye witnesses who confirmed that they had seen

00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:24.961
them, but critics say the entire story sounds slightly improbable.

00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:31.371
Nevertheless, the story of the golden plates is central to the entire Mormon faith.

00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:37.611
The result of the translation was a book called The Book of Mormon,

00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:42.481
which is the central text of the religion known as Mormonism.

00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:48.551
This book tells the story of a group of Israelites, a group of Hebrews, who

00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:55.051
travelled from Jerusalem to America in 600 BC, split up, and eventually died out.

00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:59.621
The important subtext of this is that America has

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.901
an important role in this story, and this religion.

00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:05.931
In the Bible, as you may know, it doesn’t.

00:06:06.679 --> 00:06:13.679
So, long story short, a boy is visited by God and Jesus, they tell him to not join any church

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:20.529
because they are all preaching an incorrect version of Christianity, he finds golden plates buried

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:27.154
in the ground, translates them with God-given powers, returns the plates to the ground, and a

00:06:27.154 --> 00:06:33.469
new text is published, The Book of Mormon, which creates a link between God, Jesus, and America.

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:37.709
Now, you will of course decide for yourself whether you think this

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:43.479
story is true or not, but this is the history of the start of Mormonism.

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.968
Shortly after, Joseph Smith created his own church, The

00:06:49.278 --> 00:06:53.092
Church of Christ, with the Book of Mormon at the centre of it.

00:06:54.298 --> 00:07:00.918
To say that it was an instant hit would be an overstatement, but a small group of devoted

00:07:00.918 --> 00:07:07.618
followers started to cluster around Joseph Smith Junior, he started to attract supporters.

00:07:08.538 --> 00:07:14.138
They called themselves Latter-day Saints, and indeed, the real name for what is

00:07:14.138 --> 00:07:20.058
colloquially called the Mormon Church is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

00:07:21.258 --> 00:07:25.838
These Latter-day Saints believed that their church was the one true

00:07:25.838 --> 00:07:30.958
church of Christ, that it was the true manifestation of Christianity.

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:38.428
Smith’s followers had started to multiply, and different branches had started to form.

00:07:39.518 --> 00:07:46.038
Communities were created in Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois, and followers were

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:52.718
attracted by a message of a new form of Christianity with a uniquely American twist.

00:07:53.918 --> 00:08:00.568
We won’t go into huge detail on the theological differences between Mormonism and Christianity,

00:08:00.858 --> 00:08:07.768
but some of the main ones are that it was led by a living prophet, Joseph Smith Junior, and

00:08:08.038 --> 00:08:15.205
that it had this third religious text, The Book of Mormon, alongside the Old and New Testaments.

00:08:16.078 --> 00:08:20.808
The Old and New Testament were still important for Mormons, but they

00:08:20.808 --> 00:08:25.588
believed that they weren’t completely accurate, and had some errors.

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:31.659
For Christians at the time, this was sacrilegious, it was heresy.

00:08:32.248 --> 00:08:36.778
The word of God was indisputable, you couldn't just say that you had been

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:42.318
visited by God, had found some gold plates and started your own religion.

00:08:43.338 --> 00:08:48.408
Smith was criticised as a madman, a fraud, a cult-leader,

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:52.408
and someone with an enlarged sense of his own importance.

00:08:54.008 --> 00:09:01.908
Then, as if to confirm some of the accusations against him, in 1844 Smith decided

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:07.708
to run for president, he put himself forward as a US presidential candidate.

00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:13.448
This really catapulted Mormonism to the front of people’s minds,

00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:18.108
and there was an increasing anti-Mormon feeling across the country.

00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:24.388
There were also growing rifts, growing divisions within the church.

00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:28.418
One practice was particularly controversial.

00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:33.438
Polygamy, or a person having multiple husbands or wives.

00:09:34.268 --> 00:09:40.028
This was something that Smith said was permitted by God, and indeed Smith

00:09:40.078 --> 00:09:46.258
reportedly had 40 wives, one of whom was a 14-year-old girl when they were married.

00:09:47.558 --> 00:09:53.648
This insistence on polygamy was to prove to be Smith’s downfall, and has been

00:09:53.658 --> 00:09:58.428
something that has stuck to people’s perceptions of Mormonism ever since.

00:09:59.488 --> 00:10:05.138
There was a dissenting Mormon group, a group of Mormons who didn’t agree with polygamy, who

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:12.128
published an article attacking Smith, and revealing the extent of the polygamy within the church.

00:10:13.118 --> 00:10:20.568
This article was published in a small Illinois newspaper in 1844, and Smith was furious.

00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:25.778
Smith also happened to be the mayor of the town where the newspaper

00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:30.548
was published, and he ordered for the newspaper office to be destroyed.

00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:37.518
This was, of course, illegal, and Smith was thrown in jail by the Illinois authorities.

00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:42.518
While he was in jail, awaiting trial, an angry mob, an

00:10:42.518 --> 00:10:47.018
angry group of people, stormed the jail and killed him.

00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:53.533
He was dead, aged just 38 years old, a martyr to his followers.

00:10:54.733 --> 00:11:00.253
With its prophetic leader dead, and increasing anti-Mormon sentiment across the

00:11:00.253 --> 00:11:06.904
country, a group of devoted believers set off west to look for a new spiritual home.

00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:11.964
They were led by a man named Brigham Young who had joined

00:11:11.984 --> 00:11:16.934
the church in 1832, just two years after it was founded.

00:11:17.884 --> 00:11:22.144
Young led his group west until they reached Utah, the

00:11:22.454 --> 00:11:26.428
mountain state sandwiched between Nevada and Colorado.

00:11:27.528 --> 00:11:33.638
When Young’s group arrived in a valley in Utah, Young reportedly said “this

00:11:33.648 --> 00:11:38.798
is the place”, and started the settlement that was to become Salt Lake City,

00:11:39.208 --> 00:11:44.008
to this day the place with the highest density of Mormons in the world.

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:51.448
With a town to call their own, the church was free to practice polygamy without fear

00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:56.958
of offending others, or at least without fear of offending people living nearby.

00:11:58.178 --> 00:12:04.518
In terms of polygamy, Brigham even got one up on the original founder of Mormonism,

00:12:04.778 --> 00:12:12.858
Joseph Smith Junior, with 55 wives and 56 children to Smith’s mere 40 wives.

00:12:13.928 --> 00:12:19.858
Now, that is an outline of the early history of Mormonism, how it started, the

00:12:19.858 --> 00:12:25.528
short but eventful life of its founder, and how the church ended up in Utah.

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:32.758
Now let’s talk about what Mormons actually believe, and what being a Mormon requires you to do.

00:12:33.868 --> 00:12:40.548
Probably the most noticeable aspect of Mormonism to non-mormons is the missionary element.

00:12:41.558 --> 00:12:48.068
Young Mormons, typically in their late teens, are strongly encouraged to go on missions

00:12:48.278 --> 00:12:53.848
to help spread the word of the church, to try to convert people to their faith.

00:12:54.838 --> 00:13:00.438
Pairs of young boys or girls are sent to different areas, to all different

00:13:00.448 --> 00:13:06.398
parts of the world, for a period of two years for boys, or 18 months for girls.

00:13:07.368 --> 00:13:12.348
They spend all their time engaging people in conversation, trying to tell

00:13:12.388 --> 00:13:17.778
people about their faith, with the objective of converting people to Mormonism.

00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:23.938
I imagine you might have seen these young missionaries in action, so to speak.

00:13:24.518 --> 00:13:26.848
They are normally pretty recognisable.

00:13:27.368 --> 00:13:32.188
They have black badges on, with their names printed clearly, and always seem to be

00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:38.418
exceptionally friendly, which certainly to some people can seem a little unnerving.

00:13:39.308 --> 00:13:44.548
They carry leaflets to give out, and of course a copy of The Book of Mormon.

00:13:45.448 --> 00:13:49.048
They work in pairs, and are not allowed to be apart

00:13:49.068 --> 00:13:51.788
from their partner unless they are using the bathroom.

00:13:52.688 --> 00:13:57.308
They aren’t allowed to use mobile phones, watch TV or read the news.

00:13:57.648 --> 00:14:02.488
And up until relatively recently they were only allowed to call home twice a year.

00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:07.515
They have slightly curious names, as well.

00:14:07.685 --> 00:14:11.915
The male missionaries are called Elders, which is weird because they

00:14:11.915 --> 00:14:16.655
are normally only 18 or 19, and the female ones are called Sisters.

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:24.205
Their entire mission is spent doing religious study and trying to speak to people about the church.

00:14:25.445 --> 00:14:31.435
There are of course some interesting and important ethical questions about missionary work.

00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:36.445
The entire point of missionary work is to try to attract someone

00:14:36.495 --> 00:14:40.115
to your religion, to try to get them to change their beliefs.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:46.995
And is it right for Mormon missionaries to travel the world, stopping people on buses,

00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:53.365
trains, knocking on doors, and essentially being travelling salesmen for a religion?

00:14:54.495 --> 00:14:59.655
In many cases the people who become targets for the missionaries are people who

00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:05.115
are out of luck, who have been going through a tough period, and are particularly

00:15:05.395 --> 00:15:10.485
susceptible to being converted to a belief system that they might not otherwise embrace.

00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:14.945
But on the other hand one could say that these are exactly the

00:15:14.945 --> 00:15:18.955
sort of people for whom a new belief system can be very helpful.

00:15:19.615 --> 00:15:24.735
The ethics of missionary work is, very complicated, but as far as

00:15:24.745 --> 00:15:30.065
Mormon missionaries go it is indisputable that they are very effective,

00:15:30.415 --> 00:15:36.255
bringing in around 300,000 new Mormons to the church every single year.

00:15:37.165 --> 00:15:41.645
And being a missionary of course isn’t unique to Mormonism.

00:15:41.865 --> 00:15:47.335
There is a long tradition of missionary work in Christianity, for example, but it

00:15:47.335 --> 00:15:53.145
is the fact that it is such a central part of the Mormon church, and that every

00:15:53.155 --> 00:15:58.405
young Mormon is strongly encouraged to go on a mission that makes it so unique.

00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:06.655
Moving on to what you can and cannot do as a Mormon, there are some strict lifestyle behaviours.

00:16:07.615 --> 00:16:12.225
Most Mormons don’t smoke, drink alcohol or drink tea or coffee.

00:16:12.665 --> 00:16:18.245
There’s no gambling, you should avoid bad language, no sex before marriage,

00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:23.725
and more homely suggestions such as volunteering to help your community.

00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:31.455
And when it comes to money and personal finance, there is a peculiarity of Mormonism

00:16:31.635 --> 00:16:38.885
called tithing, which requires Mormons to give 10% of their income to the church.

00:16:40.155 --> 00:16:44.755
Now that you understand this, it’s time for perhaps the first Mormon

00:16:44.755 --> 00:16:49.125
joke, and the important points to remember here are that Mormons don’t

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:53.465
drink alcohol and that they give 10% of their income to the church.

00:16:54.105 --> 00:16:54.805
Ok, ready?

00:16:55.845 --> 00:16:59.755
There was a survey done on whether someone would accept

00:16:59.895 --> 00:17:04.115
$500,000 to not drink alcohol for the rest of their life.

00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:08.235
The Mormon answered, so the joke goes, “Of course!

00:17:08.535 --> 00:17:12.495
It would be the easiest $450,000 I’ve ever made”.

00:17:13.545 --> 00:17:15.855
So, there you go, a Mormon joke.

00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:21.275
Again, a religion encouraging its followers to donate to it is

00:17:21.455 --> 00:17:25.725
nothing new, and it’s something familiar to most world religions.

00:17:26.495 --> 00:17:31.675
But this particular system, the tithing system, has been criticised

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:37.065
for being excessive, and for Mormon priests encouraging followers to

00:17:37.365 --> 00:17:40.945
donate to the church even if they don’t have enough money to do so.

00:17:41.765 --> 00:17:46.675
This can actually make being a Mormon quite an expensive life choice.

00:17:47.135 --> 00:17:51.325
Although unless you are a very high earner it’s probably quite a bit

00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:55.715
cheaper than being a Scientologist, as we’ll find out in the next episode.

00:17:57.065 --> 00:18:01.625
Like Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists and most other world

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:05.505
religions, Mormons have a holy building where they worship.

00:18:05.865 --> 00:18:06.925
It’s called a temple.

00:18:07.455 --> 00:18:13.925
But unlike, for example, a Christian church, non-Mormons can’t go into a Mormon temple.

00:18:15.025 --> 00:18:20.625
This has led to another of the major criticisms of Mormonism, that it

00:18:20.625 --> 00:18:26.615
is so secretive, that nobody really knows what goes on inside a temple.

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:34.465
As a non-Mormon, I of course can’t shed any light about what actually goes on, but accounts

00:18:34.505 --> 00:18:40.905
from ex-Mormons suggest that it isn’t actually particularly exciting or strange, and if

00:18:40.915 --> 00:18:46.915
you are expecting or imagining that there is something completely different and bizarre

00:18:46.915 --> 00:18:53.005
that happens during a Mormon service, then, you would probably be quite disappointed.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:59.520
Now, although Mormonism might have started off as a divine message

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:03.840
being passed to a young man, or the crazy ramblings of a madman,

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.850
depending on your point of view, it has grown into a world religion.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:14.600
In fact, there are around 16 million Mormons worldwide, which makes the Mormon

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:20.420
population larger than the Jewish population, which is just under 15 million.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:27.380
While growth might have initially been slow, from the mid 1950s things really started

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.550
to take off, and the number of Mormons has continued to grow every single year.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.590
It took around 100 years for the church to get its first million

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:43.340
members, then another 15 years for it to double in size to 2 million.

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:51.500
By 1995 it had crossed 10 million, and since then it has added another 6 million members.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:56.720
And although growth has slowed in percentage terms,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.070
the number of Mormons continues to increase every year.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.220
This is thought to come down to two main factors.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.850
Firstly, the missionary programme.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:12.460
If there are more people converted to Mormonism every year than Mormons that either

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:17.600
die or leave the church, then statistically the population will continue to grow.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:25.970
And these missionaries, as we heard, bring in around 300,000 new recruits every single year.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:34.310
And secondly Mormons tend to have large families, partly because of cultural reasons, and

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:41.250
partly because for years the church discouraged the use of birth control, of contraception.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:51.690
The average Mormon aged 40-49 had 3.4 children, which is compared to an American average of 2.1.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:57.880
So they have around 50% more children, and assuming that these children

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.810
are brought up to be Mormons, then the population will continue to grow.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:09.910
I should say that polygamy, or having multiple wives or husbands, is now forbidden in the mainstream

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:15.800
Mormon church, so if you are thinking that the reason they have so many children is because

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:21.310
they have multiple partners, that’s not a major reason anymore, it’s a common misconception.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.140
In terms of where Mormons are in the world, the world centre for

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.780
Mormonism is still the US, with the heart of the faith in Salt Lake City,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.820
in Utah, where just under half of the city defines itself as Mormon.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.470
And the rising number of Mormons has also meant that there

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.150
has been an increasing amount of Mormons in the public eye.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:53.460
Probably the most famous, the most well-known, active Mormon to date is Mitt Romney, the current

00:21:53.490 --> 00:22:00.274
US Senator for Utah, and the Republican Presidential candidate against Barack Obama in 2012.

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:05.700
You’ll remember that he wasn’t the first Mormon to have run for president.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:13.320
Indeed, the prophetic founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith Junior, ran for president back in 1844.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.040
But while Joseph Smith Junior was viewed by most non-Mormons

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:24.780
as a mad, completely unrealistic candidate, Mitt Romney wasn’t.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.310
Romney was a successful American businessman.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:35.680
He was rich, he was articulate, he was well dressed, he looked and talked like a politician.

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.140
And he was a proud mormon.

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.780
For many Americans, this was the first time that they had

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.880
seen someone who was a Mormon in such a powerful position.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:55.100
But not everyone was or is keen on the idea of having a Mormon president, and around 20% of

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:00.910
American voters still say that they wouldn’t vote for a Mormon candidate out of principle.

00:23:01.623 --> 00:23:05.063
As you will know, Romney lost the presidential election.

00:23:05.703 --> 00:23:10.323
There were plenty of valid reasons that were completely unrelated to his

00:23:10.323 --> 00:23:15.974
faith, including the criticism of him being robotic and overly corporate, and

00:23:16.093 --> 00:23:20.973
this was especially the case compared to the more eloquent and approachable

00:23:20.973 --> 00:23:25.863
Barack Obama, but his Mormonism certainly didn’t help his chances.

00:23:26.813 --> 00:23:32.413
In terms of criticisms of Mormonism, as with almost every major world religion,

00:23:32.673 --> 00:23:37.613
there are plenty of people who grow up in strict religious households who

00:23:37.743 --> 00:23:42.773
choose to break free, and make different life choices to their parents,

00:23:42.873 --> 00:23:47.403
their siblings, their wider familiy, and the communities in which they live.

00:23:48.613 --> 00:23:54.303
Given how strict Mormonism can be in terms of what you can and cannot do, as

00:23:54.303 --> 00:23:59.943
well as the perceived secrecy of the religion, and the number of articles and

00:23:59.943 --> 00:24:05.213
videos that exist about people who have “escaped” from the religion, you could

00:24:05.213 --> 00:24:10.183
be forgiven for thinking that a large proportion of people leave it every year.

00:24:11.153 --> 00:24:15.673
But in fact, Mormonism has a similar percentage of people who leave

00:24:15.673 --> 00:24:20.023
it every year compared to some of the major branches of Christianity.

00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:27.463
In the US around 64% of adults who were raised in a Mormon family still identify

00:24:27.483 --> 00:24:35.323
as Mormons today, vs 65% for evangelical Protestants and 59% for Catholics.

00:24:36.103 --> 00:24:41.723
So, Mormons don’t quit in any larger degrees than Protestants or Catholics.

00:24:42.443 --> 00:24:50.023
Now, this comparison between Mormonism, Protestantism and Catholicism might be unnerving to you.

00:24:50.613 --> 00:24:55.203
Indeed, for more established forms of Christianity, accepting

00:24:55.363 --> 00:24:59.553
Mormonism as another form of Christianity isn’t easy.

00:25:00.003 --> 00:25:05.043
Mormons consider themselves to be Christians, but The Catholic Church doesn’t

00:25:05.043 --> 00:25:09.213
consider Mormons to be Christians, nor do several Protestant churches.

00:25:10.103 --> 00:25:17.043
This is, evidently, a tricky theological issue, but the point is that Mormonism has this

00:25:17.153 --> 00:25:23.763
complex relationship with Christianity where its followers believe it to be an enhanced

00:25:23.773 --> 00:25:29.863
version of Christianity, but most Catholic and Protestant churches don’t accept it at all.

00:25:30.883 --> 00:25:33.743
So, where does this leave the Mormon church?

00:25:34.303 --> 00:25:37.753
It certainly doesn’t seem to be in a particularly bad place financially.

00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:44.593
Its policy of collecting 10% of its followers' incomes has turned it into an incredibly

00:25:44.593 --> 00:25:52.286
wealthy organisation, with a whistleblower claiming that it now has a fund of $100 billion.

00:25:53.383 --> 00:25:58.973
And if the religion continues to grow at a healthy rate, with hundreds of

00:25:58.973 --> 00:26:03.763
thousands of people joining the faith every year, and continuing to contribute

00:26:03.763 --> 00:26:09.213
to the church, then this number, this war chest, will only continue to grow.

00:26:10.523 --> 00:26:16.593
As a European, one can look at Mormonism and see something quintessentially American.

00:26:17.283 --> 00:26:23.493
We’ll explore this idea further in the next episodes on Scientology, but there is something

00:26:23.523 --> 00:26:29.533
amazing in the idea that a young man can come back from the woods and say that he has been

00:26:29.533 --> 00:26:35.403
visited by God and Jesus Christ, then a few years later that he has found some gold plates

00:26:35.433 --> 00:26:41.783
with the word of God written on them, amass a following, start a city, and within 150

00:26:41.793 --> 00:26:47.953
years there is a world religion bigger than Judaism with $100 billion of cash in the bank.

00:26:48.963 --> 00:26:53.623
One can choose to believe in Mormonism, in the Church of Jesus Christ

00:26:53.623 --> 00:26:58.603
of the Latter Day Saints, or not, but it is very hard to deny that what

00:26:58.613 --> 00:27:03.793
they have achieved is impressive, and would be possible only in America.

00:27:06.443 --> 00:27:10.853
OK then, that is it for this little look at Mormonism.

00:27:11.343 --> 00:27:15.913
I hope you enjoyed it, that you learned something new, and the next time you see a

00:27:15.923 --> 00:27:21.853
young man or woman with a black name badge who is about to engage you in conversation

00:27:22.203 --> 00:27:27.303
, well, you’ll know a little bit about the history of what they believe and why.

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:33.703
As I said at the start of this episode, this was part one of a three-part series.

00:27:33.973 --> 00:27:40.443
Next up we’ll talk about Scientology, another classic but very weird American success story,

00:27:40.693 --> 00:27:46.703
which has also managed to amass believers all over the world and a bulging bank balance.

00:27:47.323 --> 00:27:52.803
And then in part three, the final part, we will come back to look at some of the

00:27:52.813 --> 00:27:58.313
similarities and differences between the two, and discuss some of the questions

00:27:58.503 --> 00:28:02.843
that an understanding of Mormonism and Scientology get us thinking about.

00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:07.173
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:28:07.173 --> 00:28:10.313
this episode, and what you made of this mini series.

00:28:10.793 --> 00:28:14.683
If you do happen to be a Mormon, or if you have friends or family who are

00:28:14.683 --> 00:28:19.753
Mormon, or if you have any particular views on the subject, I would love to know.

00:28:20.253 --> 00:28:23.493

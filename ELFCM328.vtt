Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.860
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.089
The show where you can listen to
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.540
and wonderful things about the world at
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.020
I'm Alastair Budge, and this is going
to be the last episode of 2022, so today

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.960
we are going to be talking about some
unusual news stories from the year,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.010
stories that, even if you live in the
UK or you follow British news closely,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.520
you might not have been aware of.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.980
On our little journey we’ll come
across footballer’s wives, misbehaving

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.350
politicians, the changing demographics
of the country, a mad man with a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.189
crossbow and the crime of high treason.

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:56.207
OK then, The Unusual British News of 2022.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:01.767
It might sound like an understatement
to say that a lot has happened in the

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.939
UK since the first of January of 2022.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:11.017
The country, as of the time of recording,
has had three different prime ministers,

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:16.257
experienced the hottest day on record,
and the British pound dipped to an

00:01:16.317 --> 00:01:18.287
all-time low against the dollar.

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:24.807
But perhaps the biggest national change
is one you will no doubt be aware of.

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:31.257
The country lost a queen in Elizabeth
II, and got a new king, Charles the III.

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:36.337
So, our first category of unusual
news is going to be related to

00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:37.797
this change in the monarchy.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:42.337
But before you complain and say, hey,
you said this would be “unusual”,

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:46.057
and I already knew about this queen
that you people seem to like so much,

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:50.437
don’t worry, here you’ll learn what
I hope will be some unusual pieces

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:52.057
of news about the queen this year.

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:57.997
So, firstly, you probably already knew
that on February the 6th the Queen

00:01:58.037 --> 00:02:03.547
celebrated her Platinum Jubilee, her
70th anniversary as queen of the country.

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:09.127
You might not have known that on June
the 12th of this year she became the

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:15.468
second-longest serving monarch in world
history, overtaking the king of Thailand.

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:19.978
She didn’t quite manage to
claim first position, however.

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:25.278
This is still held by King Louis
XIV of France, although he did get

00:02:25.298 --> 00:02:29.498
a significant headstart on Queen
Elizabeth II, because he became

00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:31.698
king when he was a mere 4 years old.

00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:37.198
And if you are wondering whether
Charles, her son, will manage to beat

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:41.348
his mother, well let me just tell
you that he would have to live until

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:44.438
his 144th birthday to manage that.

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:50.848
But while his mother, Queen Elizabeth,
did manage to live to a ripe old 96

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:55.578
years old, it might surprise you to find
out that on Christmas Day last year,

00:02:55.858 --> 00:03:01.218
in fact, an armed intruder was arrested
after attempting to break in to Windsor

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:06.498
Castle, where the queen was staying, where
he was planning to assassinate her with

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:09.108
a crossbow, a powerful bow and arrow.

00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:16.168
Sure, this was technically news from
2021, but the unusual news from 2022

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:22.058
about this case is that in August of
2022, the man who attempted to kill

00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:28.138
the queen became the last person to be
charged with treason, with the crime of

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:29.848
attempting to kill the head of state.

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:36.621
Interestingly enough, there is an act
of parliament, called the 1842 Treason

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:41.180
Act, that constitutionally allows for
someone to be charged for the crime

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.470
of attempting to harm the queen.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.980
Fortunately, she passed away peacefully in
her bed on September the 8th, she wasn’t

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.560
shot by a madman with a bow and arrow, but
it is certainly interesting and refreshing

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.490
that English law has an Act ready to
punish anyone who attempts such a crime.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.310
Now, our second “unusual” British
news story of 2022 also relates to

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.990
the law, and this is a trial that
was dubbed by the British press

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.330
as the “Wagatha Christie” trial.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.910
In practical terms, it was
a trial between two women,

00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:20.810
Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.830
You might not have heard of these
two women before, but you may

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.960
have heard of their husbands:
Jamie Vardy and Wayne Rooney.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.910
If you haven’t heard of them, they are
both famous English football players.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.680
So, why were these two women
fighting each other in court?

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.620
Well, the story went something like this.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.880
There were articles coming out in
the British press about the private

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.680
life of Coleen Rooney, stories
that she wanted to remain private

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.500
and not get leaked to the press.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.080
She thought that one of her
Instagram followers was passing

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.600
information about her private
life to the tabloid newspapers.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.030
She suspected that it was
Rebekah Vardy, the wife of her

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.600
husband’s England teammate.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.360
So, what did she do?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.660
Well, she planted “fake” stories
to try to catch Rebekah Vardy out.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.830
There is a setting on Instagram where
you can choose to only show your

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.950
Instagram Stories to certain people,
so Coleen Rooney selected to only

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.550
show certain stories to Rebekah Vardy.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.880
Then if these stories appeared in the
British tabloids, ta-dah, she would know

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.470
that it was Vardy who was responsible
for passing them on to the journalists.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.970
Low and behold, the stories
did appear in the press.

00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:53.730
In 2021, Rooney shocked her followers
when she revealed this plot on

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.510
Twitter, and accused Rebekah Vardy
of having sold these stories.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.100
Naturally, Vardy denied
it, she said it wasn’t her.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.030
She didn’t need the money, and why would
she do something like that to her friend?

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.730
What’s more, she took Rooney to court
for something called “libel”, which

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.890
is the crime of accusing someone in
public and harming their reputation.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.730
But Coleen Rooney stood firm,
and the pair met in court.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.210
It was an extensive trial,
with the British press calling

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.310
Coleen “Wagatha Christie”.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.670
A “wag”, by the way, is a nickname
for the wives and girlfriends of

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.710
footballers, it comes from the acronym
W-A-G, WAG, wives and girlfriend.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.820
And Agatha Christie was a famous British
crime writer, so Rooney acquired this

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.930
nickname because of her combined status
as “wag” and excellent detective.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.020
On the 29th of July of 2022, the
court announced its judgement.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.480
The jury concluded that there was
enough evidence to suggest that Vardy

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.600
had actually been guilty of leaking the
stories, and the case was thrown out.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.590
The trial itself was almost like a comic
soap opera, or a bad Agatha Christie

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.070
novel, with Vardy’s agent claiming to
have dropped her phone into the North

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:27.320
Sea by accident, and Vardy’s supposed “IT
expert” to have forgotten the password

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.260
to important encrypted messaging data.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:36.030
It turned out that Rebekah Vardy had lost
more than her dignity or a mobile phone.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.440
The judge ordered her to pay Coleen
Rooney’s legal costs as well as her own,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:48.220
with the entire debacle estimated to have
cost her £3 million pounds, so that’s

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.510
almost three and a half million Euros.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.800
Now, our third category of “unusual news”,
after the royals and the footballers’

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.020
wives, is relating to a category of people
you might not expect to be misbehaving.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.100
Or perhaps you would
completely expect it of them.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.800
And this is politicians.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.600
2022 was a year of some pretty bad
behaviour by British politicians.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.060
First, as you may remember, the British
Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.970
mired in controversy for the first
half of the year for having held a

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.440
series of parties at 10 Downing Street,
at the home of the Prime Minister.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.680
In normal times, of course, there
would be nothing wrong with this,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.370
especially for a prime minister
who has made no secret of the fact

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.280
that he enjoys having a good time.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:45.210
But these parties had taken place
during strict COVID lockdowns, so while

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.550
the Prime Minister was on TV telling
people that they shouldn’t leave their

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.320
houses or socialise with anyone, he
was proved to be having extensive

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.660
gatherings that went completely against
the rules that he himself had set out.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.400
In classic Boris Johnson style, he
tried to get out of these accusations,

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.650
saying that he knew nothing about them
and that he was sure that all of the

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.790
rules had been followed, but as the
months went on, more and more details

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:17.300
emerged, including that Boris Johson
knew exactly what had happened and

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.540
had been at many of these parties.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.570
So, that’s certainly bad behaviour, and
was one of the many reasons that Johnson

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.450
was forced to resign in July of 2022.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:35.070
Now, the second “political misbehaviour”
is a very unusual one indeed, and

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.820
I’ll leave you to decide for yourself
how it compares to the behaviour of

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.460
Boris Johnson and the parties, or
partygate as it was dubbed by the press.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.420
In April of 2022, a group of female
Conservative members of parliament,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:55.540
or MPs, met with a senior politician
to discuss the issue of sexism in

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.970
Westminster, in British politics.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.080
One of the women complained that she
had been sitting next to a male MP

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.030
who had been watching pornography on
his phone in the House of Commons,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.570
in the Houses of Parliament.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:15.650
If you have seen pictures or videos of the
House of Commons, yes I’m talking about

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.700
those long benches with green cushions,
the centre of the British parliament.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:28.150
She didn’t name the man, but he was later
revealed to be an MP called Neil Parish.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.780
And what did Mr Parish say?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.560
Did he deny it?

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.460
Did he say it couldn’t possibly have
been him, or that his colleague must

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.600
have been mistaken in what she saw?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.640
He didn’t, actually, but his
excuse wasn’t bought by everyone.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:49.050
He said that he was searching
for tractors, and had stumbled

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:53.210
across a pornography website,
and he had continued to watch.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:59.070
He also admitted that he had watched
porn in the House of Commons a second

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:04.160
time, and that time he had skipped the
tractors and went straight for the porn.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.040
Although his boss, Boris Johnson, had
survived multiple scandals, some perhaps

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:17.070
even more saucy than this, it was too much
for Parish, and he was forced to resign

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.620
his position as member of parliament.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.990
He does still claim that he was
initially looking for tractors, and

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.060
I’ll leave you to decide whether
you believe him on that count.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.580
Our third political misbehaviour
story is a slightly darker one, but

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:37.390
it is important, and goes to show how
much this behaviour was tolerated in

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:42.640
Westminster, so much so that it has
been dubbed “Pestminster” by the press.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:49.790
In July of 2022, another Conservative
politician, a man named Chris Pincher,

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.950
was forced to resign after it emerged that
there were a whole range of accusations

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.970
of sexual assault against him dating
back 10 years, going back a decade.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.380
The culmination of all of this had been
the events of one evening, on the 30th of

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:12.410
June, when Pincher had gone to a private
club in an exclusive area of London, drunk

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.120
too much and sexually assaulted two men.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.500
Nasty stuff indeed, but it would
have far-reaching consequences.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.030
It turned out that Boris Johnson, the
then Prime Minister, knew all about

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:31.530
Pincher’s reputation, even joking that he
was “Pincher by name, pincher by nature”.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.370
If you are a pincher, by the way, it means
you grab or take something from someone

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.530
that you shouldn’t, or you touch them
inappropriately, without their permission.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.460
Anyway, Boris Johnson knew all
about Pincher’s reputation,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.120
yet he still appointed him to a
senior position in government.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.470
And this was the straw that broke
the camel’s back for Johnson, the

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.481
nail in the coffin in his tenure
as Prime Minister, and he was

00:12:59.481 --> 00:13:01.401
forced to resign a few days later.

00:13:02.311 --> 00:13:05.881
Now, you might be surprised to hear
that we aren’t going to talk about

00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:07.721
Liz Truss at all in this episode.

00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:09.691
And that’s for two reasons.

00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:15.511
Firstly, it’s not completely unusual,
and although there are plenty of unusual

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:19.491
and unexpected bits of her chaotic
44 days in charge of the country,

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.011
you probably know some of it already.

00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:27.091
And the second reason is that
there is just so much to unpack,

00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:31.351
so we can’t do it justice in a
small five minute section here.

00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:37.391
The good news is that we did just do
an entire episode on the mad and tragic

00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:42.391
44 days of Liz Truss, so if you haven’t
listened to that one already, then that

00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:45.021
one's for you, it’s episode number 327.

00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:50.403
Now, the final piece of unusual news
is something that lots of people aren’t

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:55.729
aware of outside the UK, and many people
aren’t aware of even inside the UK.

00:13:56.559 --> 00:14:01.769
And this is related to the shifting
demographics of the country, specifically,

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:04.979
the increasing multiculturalism of the UK.

00:14:06.099 --> 00:14:11.399
This isn’t “news”, in so much as
it's a gradual change, but there

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:15.039
are some important pieces of news
to mention that highlight the

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.729
increasing diversity of the country.

00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:23.119
The first piece of “unusual news”
is related to the publication of the

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:29.159
results of the national Census, a big
survey that is done of the UK population

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:34.339
every 10 years, which tries to answer
questions like “how many people live

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:36.469
in the country?” and “who are they?”.

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:42.559
The results started to be published
this year, and had, for some,

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:46.959
surprising results, especially
with the fact that the UK has been

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:51.889
painted by many outside the country
as anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant.

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:57.169
Of course, the Brexit vote gave people
a pretty good reason to think that

00:14:57.169 --> 00:15:01.829
this was the case, but the results of
the Census show that the country is

00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:06.849
different to what a lot of people think,
and it is indeed much more multicultural

00:15:06.849 --> 00:15:09.189
than many large European countries.

00:15:09.969 --> 00:15:15.629
So, it might surprise you to find
out that one in every six people in

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:22.589
England and Wales was born outside
the UK, a 33% increase from 2011.

00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:28.661
If you’re interested, the top five
countries were, in this order, India,

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:32.051
Poland, Pakistan, Romania and Ireland.

00:15:33.091 --> 00:15:38.341
This non-UK born population is highly
concentrated in the cities, which

00:15:38.551 --> 00:15:40.881
tend to be more multicultural places.

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:47.381
One area of London, for example,
Brent, has 56% of its residents

00:15:47.521 --> 00:15:49.361
who were born outside the UK.

00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:55.081
Put simply, the UK is a lot more
multicultural and multinational

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:56.711
than many people think it is.

00:15:57.881 --> 00:16:02.928
And this is particularly important when
one remembers that in the summer of 2022,

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:08.085
the Prime Minister of the country was
chosen only by members of the Conservative

00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:13.205
Party, fewer than a hundred thousand
people voted for Liz Truss, and these

00:16:13.225 --> 00:16:19.645
voters were overwhelmingly, 97%, white,
over half of them were over 60, and they

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.865
lived primarily in the south of England.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:27.245
Essentially, the Prime Minister was
voted in by a tiny proportion of the

00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:31.870
country’s population, and a proportion
of the population that was utterly

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.650
unrepresentative of the real electorate.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.010
Now, as you’ll remember, the Prime
Minister that was chosen by the members

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.240
of the Conservative Party, Liz Truss,
didn’t do a very good job at all.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.470
Nevertheless, her tenure as Prime
Minister did break some records, and not

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.410
only for the shortest time in office.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.230
On September the 6th of this
year, when Liz Truss announced

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.480
her cabinet, a record was broken.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.990
It was the first time in British
history that the “Great Offices of

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.450
State” didn’t contain a white man.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:11.180
The “Great Offices of State” are the
most important political jobs in the

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.829
country: so that's the Prime Minister,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:20.740
is basically the Minister of Finance, the
Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:27.100
Now, these politicians might have been
trailblazers in terms of who they were,

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.780
but they were still useless politicians
and they did huge damage to the country.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:37.170
As you may well know, after they were
booted out, the country then broke a

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.960
new record when it welcomed the first
non-white Prime Minister in the form of

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.850
Rishi Sunak, who has Indian heritage.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.700
And another fun-fact about Rishi Sunak
is that, at 42 years old, he was the

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.400
youngest Prime Minister in 200 years.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.900
Although Sunak might be representative
of the changing demographics of

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:03.220
the country, he has been criticised
for being pretty unrepresentative

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.180
in almost every other way.

00:18:06.493 --> 00:18:11.053
Specifically, his bank balance
certainly is not representative of

00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:12.773
the average person in the country.

00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:18.213
When his wife’s fortune is taken
into account, Sunak holds the record

00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:22.163
for being the richest ever British
Prime Minister, with a combined

00:18:22.163 --> 00:18:24.883
fortune of almost a billion Euros.

00:18:26.303 --> 00:18:30.712
So, there you have it,
the unusual news of 2022.

00:18:31.183 --> 00:18:35.853
This year the UK has broken records
for the longest monarch, the world’s

00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:39.843
longest-serving female monarch, the
richest Prime Minister, the youngest

00:18:39.853 --> 00:18:44.413
Prime Minister, the shortest-serving
Prime Minister, it’s broken multicultural

00:18:44.413 --> 00:18:48.753
records, it has seen some extremely
bad behaviour from politicians, and

00:18:48.913 --> 00:18:53.862
last but not least, some exceptional
detective work from footballer’s wives.

00:18:56.262 --> 00:19:01.523
OK then, that is it for today's episode
on The Unusual British News of 2022.

00:19:01.903 --> 00:19:05.393
I hope it's been an interesting one,
and whether it’s footballers’ wives,

00:19:05.493 --> 00:19:08.803
naughty politicians or the changing
make-up of the country, that you've

00:19:08.803 --> 00:19:10.713
learnt something new about the UK.

00:19:11.393 --> 00:19:14.353
As always, I would love to know
what you thought about this episode.

00:19:14.723 --> 00:19:18.393
Are there any unusual stories from the
UK that you remember from this year?

00:19:18.843 --> 00:19:22.503
Do you remember how the news of the
queen’s death was covered in your country?

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.713
What is the most unusual news
from your country this year?

00:19:26.173 --> 00:19:29.593

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.609
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.560
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.877
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about an American family, The Kardashians.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.830
Like them or loathe them, over the past two decades this one family has shaped not

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.740
just American but global culture, changing the way people look, dress, and behave.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.060
So, in this episode we are going to tell their story: we’ll look at

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.820
how they became famous, the influence they've had and continued to

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.960
have on culture, and whether this is all about to come crumbling down.

00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:57.271
OK then, The Kardashians.

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:05.761
The popular movie and TV series review site, IMDB.com, is usually a pretty

00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.741
good place to go to get an idea of whether a TV or movie is worth watching.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:15.641
The site collects reviews by professional film critics as well as

00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:20.551
regular people, you or I can review any film and leave a rating.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:26.291
The highest rated film on the website is Shawshank Redemption,

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:32.561
which gets a rating of 9.3 from a total of 2.8 million viewers.

00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:38.701
And even films that are considered to be huge flops, commercial

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:42.601
failures, don’t tend to get such terrible user ratings.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.911
John Carter, a 2012 film which lost an inflation-adjusted $250 million at the box office gets a

00:01:52.941 --> 00:02:01.851
6.6/10, and The Lone Ranger, a film that lost a similar amount of money, gets a 6.4 out of 10.

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:08.351
The point is, user reviews tend to be quite generous, and a

00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:13.431
film or TV series has to be really bad to get a very low rating.

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:24.711
So, let me introduce you to a TV series that is rated a measly 2.8 out of 10 from 31,000 viewers.

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:31.301
It's called Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and it is currently ranked

00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:37.764
number 22 on the worst TV series of all time, as per the users of IMDB.

00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:42.051
Let me read you a few reviews of it, to give you a

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:44.861
sense of some of the people’s opinions of the show:

00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:53.831
“Makes you sad to be part of the human race”, “This show is 100% pure car crash TV.”, “The worst TV

00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:59.741
show on the planet....”, “stupid, stupid, stupid”, “The worst thing to ever be shown on television”

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:07.071
and a particularly cutting one, “This show is designed by idiots, featuring idiots, for idiots.”

00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:16.356
But this show would go on from 2007 to 2020 , earn its creators and

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:21.786
its stars hundreds of millions, and, indirectly, billions of dollars,

00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:27.936
and turn one family into one of the most famous families in the world.

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:33.666
Even if you think you know nothing about the Kardashians, and have zero

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:39.186
interest in what they are up to, the influence of The Kardashians is everywhere.

00:03:40.056 --> 00:03:45.986
So, to find out how they managed to go from relative obscurity to this

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:50.296
huge global brand, we need to first talk about some family history.

00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:58.196
The family starts with a mother and father, Robert Kardashian and his wife, Kris.

00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:05.786
Robert was a wealthy businessman and lawyer, but he was cast into the public

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:11.336
eye during the trial of OJ Simpson, which we talked about in our last episode

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:18.988
.
Robert had four children with his wife, Kris, before the pair divorced in 1991.

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:28.673
The children were, in age order, Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob, all with the surname Kardashian.

00:04:30.106 --> 00:04:36.726
A few years after the pair’s divorce, Kris married a former Olympic athlete then called

00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:43.131
Bruce Jenner, and the pair went on to have two children: Kendall Jenner, and Kylie Jenner.

00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:48.991
So, you had this situation where the Kardashian family, three girls

00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:53.421
and a boy, lived with their half-sisters, the two Jenner girls.

00:04:54.741 --> 00:04:59.681
The family lived a privileged life in a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles.

00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:05.951
Sure, they lived in a nice house, had fancy cars, and so on, but their

00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:10.361
lives were not so different to the other wealthy teenagers around them.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:17.701
This would all change in 2007, when a cameraman was first

00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:21.221
invited into their house to film them having a barbecue.

00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:27.591
See, a year earlier, Kris, the children’s mother, had had an idea.

00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:35.451
She had seen the success of another reality TV series about a celebrity family, The Osbournes,

00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:41.541
and she had approached a TV producer to make the same kind of drama about her family.

00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:46.441
Her youngest child, by the way, Kylie Jenner, was

00:05:46.451 --> 00:05:50.591
only 9 years old, while the oldest, Kourtney was 28.

00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:58.731
The cameramen came to film this supposedly “natural” Sunday barbecue, the producer saw the tape

00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:06.214
and managed to get it onto cable TV, creating a series called “Keeping Up With The Kardashians”.

00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:11.271
Now, you may have watched an episode of this TV series, you may not have.

00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:17.151
The basic premise is this: the show follows the day-to-day lives of the

00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:23.611
Kardashian family, initially the three older daughters, Kourtney, Kim and Khloé.

00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:29.129
They go shopping, they talk about their lives, they have minor disagreements,

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:33.381
but they always make up and talk about how family is so important to them.

00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:37.591
I mean, you heard that the show is one of the lowest rated

00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:42.031
on IMDB, so there isn’t a huge amount more to it than this.

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:49.865
Despite being panned, heavily criticised by many, it drew a loyal audience

00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:55.745
and continued for 14 years, following the daughters as they grew up and did

00:06:55.745 --> 00:07:00.175
things that many people can relate to: they fell in love, they got married,

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:03.935
they got divorced, they struggled with finding their place in the world.

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:08.895
On one level, completely relatable experiences.

00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:13.615
On the other hand, their lives were so foreign and

00:07:13.615 --> 00:07:17.025
exotic that they lived in a completely different world.

00:07:17.855 --> 00:07:21.565
They went on luxurious holidays and travelled on private jets,

00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:26.115
had personal stylists, they flew their friends to private islands.

00:07:27.315 --> 00:07:32.815
And it was this combination of supposedly “normal” life and “celebrity”

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:37.385
life that started to draw people to the show and to its stars.

00:07:38.385 --> 00:07:41.075
These were young women who were just like you.

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:45.395
Yes, they might live very different lives in terms of

00:07:45.395 --> 00:07:47.965
the level of luxury and privilege that they enjoyed.

00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:54.885
But they were just a normal family in terms of sibling rivalry, fights, and so on.

00:07:56.455 --> 00:08:02.595
And you didn’t just watch the TV series, you could follow their every move on social media.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.835
They were relatively early to understand the power of having a personal

00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:13.625
brand on social media, and the Kardashians, between them, now boast

00:08:13.645 --> 00:08:19.275
a combined 1.9 billion followers across their social media platforms.

00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:24.525
You could like and comment on their photos, as if you were their friend.

00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:29.875
You would see where they had been, what they've been doing, what they were wearing.

00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:36.185
And soon enough, just like a best friend would, they were more than

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:40.805
happy to tell you what to buy so that you could look just like them.

00:08:42.215 --> 00:08:47.515
Sometimes these would be endorsements of other products, “I use x or y

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:51.915
make-up brand and it’s amazing”, for which they would charge a hefty fee.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:58.845
If you remember Fyre Festival, from episode number 360, one of the sisters,

00:08:59.245 --> 00:09:06.175
Kendall Jenner, was paid $250,000 for a single Instagram post, and the

00:09:06.175 --> 00:09:12.095
sisters now reportedly charge a minimum of $100,000 per social media post.

00:09:13.195 --> 00:09:18.615
But it would be through launching their own product lines and selling them to

00:09:18.615 --> 00:09:22.605
their audience directly that they would go on to really make their millions.

00:09:24.045 --> 00:09:29.175
One of the sisters, Kylie Jenner, declared herself to have become the youngest self-made

00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:34.545
billionaire in history when she sold half of her cosmetics company at the age of 21,

00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:40.475
although the extent to which she was both self-made and a billionaire has been questioned.

00:09:41.745 --> 00:09:47.075
And all of the others, all the other sisters, have fingers in lots of

00:09:47.075 --> 00:09:52.085
different pies, mostly selling some kind of beauty or fashion treatment.

00:09:53.075 --> 00:09:59.815
See, when talking about The Kardashians, talking about “appearance” is unavoidable.

00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:07.405
The TV series that catapulted them to fame  is filled with comments about physical appearance.

00:10:08.191 --> 00:10:12.791
The sisters talk about how each other look, their mother tells them that they are looking a bit

00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:18.831
fat or they should stop eating so much, they are constantly talking about fashion and appearance.

00:10:20.081 --> 00:10:24.491
And their businesses, the products that they have launched, tend to be

00:10:24.491 --> 00:10:29.541
things that the Kardashians say that they use on a day-to-day basis.

00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:34.431
If you wanted to smell like Kim Kardashian, you could buy her perfume.

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:40.494
If you wanted a t-shirt like Kendall Jenner, you could buy one for $125.

00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:46.351
If you wanted big lips like Kylie Jenner, you could buy her lip kit for $35.

00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:53.761
If you wanted slightly curvier jeans like Khloé Kardashian, you could buy her jeans for $99.

00:10:54.921 --> 00:11:00.491
Yes, there is a definite “Kardashian look”, but all the sisters were slightly

00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:05.947
different, so you could choose to look like the one that you felt the most similar to.

00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:10.301
And of course, they would cross-promote each other's stuff,

00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:14.151
so you could buy products from all of them if you so chose.

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:18.251
It might sound simple, but it was incredibly effective.

00:11:19.271 --> 00:11:24.021
Use a TV series to get a nationwide, or even global, audience.

00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:28.621
Bring that audience with you to social media and give

00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:32.361
people an inner look into your supposed private life.

00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:36.681
Use the social media algorithms to grow your audience.

00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:42.061
Continually talk about your life, your beauty routine and the products that

00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:46.941
you use, and give your hundreds of millions of social media followers the

00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:51.521
opportunity to do the same as you by buying the products you recommend.

00:11:52.981 --> 00:11:57.301
And this has made the family literally billions of dollars.

00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:02.351
So, was this all a great master plan, devised from the outset,

00:12:02.871 --> 00:12:06.921
or were they riding a wave, unsure of where it was heading?

00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:12.231
Well, it’s here that we need to reintroduce the mother of the

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:17.901
family, Kris Jenner, as up until now she has played a minor role.

00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:24.001
There are many people who believe that the entire thing was her idea, that

00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:28.391
she is the puppet master who has been pulling the strings from day one.

00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:32.711
There is some compelling evidence behind this theory.

00:12:33.951 --> 00:12:39.361
Firstly, the reality TV show was her idea, that much is well-documented.

00:12:40.211 --> 00:12:44.701
And in the TV show she can be clearly seen advising the

00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:48.061
daughters, telling them what to say and how to behave.

00:12:49.431 --> 00:12:53.331
Even before the TV show, it seems that she was laying the

00:12:53.341 --> 00:12:56.731
groundwork for this big “public launch” of her family.

00:12:57.981 --> 00:13:02.871
At the start of 2007, before the first episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians

00:13:03.031 --> 00:13:07.491
was released, another Kardashian production was made publicly available.

00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:14.681
This one, however, was not a family friendly TV series; it was a pornographic

00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:19.551
film that had been made between Kim Kardashian and her then boyfriend

00:13:20.485 --> 00:13:26.035
.
According to one biographer of the Kardashian family, this sex tape was

00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:30.645
leaked by Kim Kardashian under the direct instruction of her mother.

00:13:32.155 --> 00:13:37.485
He even claimed that there were three different sex tapes, and Kim’s mother

00:13:37.675 --> 00:13:43.135
watched all three and decided to release the one in which Kim looked best.

00:13:44.495 --> 00:13:48.435
Now, the Kardashians have always denied this, but the

00:13:48.445 --> 00:13:51.895
timing of the release of the tape was certainly convenient.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:14:00.515
At the time, Kim Kardashian was a nobody, really, she had a famous father and a famous stepfather.

00:14:01.345 --> 00:14:06.682
She was in Paris Hilton’s wider circle, and would sometimes be seen in the background

00:14:06.682 --> 00:14:12.152
of paparazzi photos of her friend Paris Hilton, but she was not much more than that.

00:14:13.662 --> 00:14:19.442
A sceptic might say that she had seen, or rather her mother, had seen the wonders

00:14:19.452 --> 00:14:23.372
that a leaked sex tape had done for Paris Hilton’s celebrity, and thought,

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:27.412
well, the Kardashians have one of those to release when the time is right…

00:14:28.872 --> 00:14:34.142
Then the sex tape got released, and Kim Kardashian went from nowhere

00:14:34.452 --> 00:14:38.732
to the talk of the town, or at least the talk of some American tabloid

00:14:38.732 --> 00:14:43.672
press, and this provided the perfect launchpad for the TV series.

00:14:45.212 --> 00:14:49.612
And this brings us neatly to the question of authenticity.

00:14:51.122 --> 00:14:56.152
Everything about the Kardashians revolved around the idea of authenticity.

00:14:56.972 --> 00:15:01.982
They came to fame with “reality” TV, a TV series that was

00:15:01.982 --> 00:15:07.172
supposedly unscripted and followed their real day-to-day lives.

00:15:07.992 --> 00:15:13.902
They sold and continue to sell products that they tell their fans they use themselves, their

00:15:13.902 --> 00:15:19.902
entire brand is based on building an authentic connection between them and their followers.

00:15:21.042 --> 00:15:24.262
But there are plenty of examples that indicate that

00:15:24.262 --> 00:15:27.662
their authenticity might not be quite what it seems.

00:15:29.092 --> 00:15:32.972
For starters, let’s talk about appearance, as everything

00:15:32.982 --> 00:15:35.422
with the Kardashians revolves around appearance.

00:15:37.052 --> 00:15:42.552
For years, Kylie Jenner denied having any kind of surgical work done on

00:15:42.552 --> 00:15:46.702
her lips, despite the fact that they were clearly much larger than before.

00:15:47.882 --> 00:15:53.682
Finally, she admitted, yes, she had had lip filler work done to enlarge her lips.

00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:58.002
Kim denied that she had had work done on her bottom

00:15:58.222 --> 00:16:01.032
to make it larger, and then admitted that she had.

00:16:02.582 --> 00:16:06.852
And their social media photos are always released with heavy

00:16:06.852 --> 00:16:11.122
filters, hiding any kind of blemishes or wrinkles or spots.

00:16:12.362 --> 00:16:18.612
Sure, there might not be anything inherently wrong with this, but if you are selling a product

00:16:18.952 --> 00:16:23.782
and telling your followers that buying this product will make you look like the person in the

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:29.922
picture, and the person in the picture has been heavily edited, then it is somewhat deceptive.

00:16:31.102 --> 00:16:35.162
Now, whenever the Kardashians have been caught out for doing this, they have

00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:39.762
been quick to talk about the perils of social media and how having hundreds of

00:16:39.762 --> 00:16:44.072
millions of people following your every move means that every inch of your body

00:16:44.072 --> 00:16:49.162
is scrutinised, and this has unfortunately caused them to take certain actions.

00:16:50.702 --> 00:16:55.842
You might have some sympathy for this, but it’s also important to remember that this

00:16:55.872 --> 00:17:00.702
media attention and fame is something that has been carefully developed over almost

00:17:00.702 --> 00:17:06.102
20 years and has made the family billions of dollars; it is something that they have

00:17:06.142 --> 00:17:11.082
actively sought out and they use to sell their wares to people all around the world.

00:17:12.242 --> 00:17:14.502
And their influence is vast.

00:17:15.402 --> 00:17:17.552
Perhaps you see this where you live.

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:19.182
I certainly do.

00:17:19.812 --> 00:17:25.462
The look of large “filled” lips, painted eyebrows and heavily contoured makeup is

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:30.032
something that has almost single handedly been popularised by the Kardashian family.

00:17:31.372 --> 00:17:36.942
For better or for worse, they influence the decisions and styles of hundreds of

00:17:36.942 --> 00:17:43.072
millions of people all over the world, and no doubt future historians will look back at

00:17:43.072 --> 00:17:49.702
photos of people in 2023 and say “that look was popularised by the Kardashian family”.

00:17:51.062 --> 00:17:56.382
And like them or loathe them, one has to admit that the Kardashian family have mastered

00:17:56.442 --> 00:18:02.442
the art of celebrity and social media, walking a fine line between reality and performance.

00:18:03.122 --> 00:18:07.782
They've actively crafted personas that feed into a lucrative business model,

00:18:08.332 --> 00:18:13.552
one that promises reality yet often delivers a carefully edited version of it.

00:18:14.942 --> 00:18:18.062
But how long will this success continue?

00:18:18.892 --> 00:18:22.396
The Kardashians shot to worldwide fame during the

00:18:22.716 --> 00:18:26.312
"Instagram era", which many would argue has already peaked.

00:18:27.272 --> 00:18:31.082
This era was all about wanting to look perfect and put together,

00:18:31.542 --> 00:18:35.222
which explains why the Kardashians were so desirable at the time.

00:18:35.922 --> 00:18:41.812
Their heavily edited photos and strategic Instagram posts were illusions of perfection.

00:18:42.932 --> 00:18:47.652
But in 2023, to the millions of people who would have been their

00:18:47.652 --> 00:18:51.792
customers, authenticity is valued more highly than perfection.

00:18:52.702 --> 00:18:57.542
So, the question remains, how will the Kardashians adapt to this new world?

00:18:58.172 --> 00:19:00.912
Will they manage to remain relevant in the years to come?

00:19:01.612 --> 00:19:05.662
Or have they spent so much of their existence promoting a fake

00:19:05.662 --> 00:19:09.082
reality that they no longer know what authentic really means?

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:15.942
Who knows, but if the past 15 years are anything to go by, it seems that

00:19:15.942 --> 00:19:20.712
there is no length the Kardashian family is not willing to go to be famous.

00:19:23.047 --> 00:19:27.187
OK then, that is it for this little exploration of The Kardashians.

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.837
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

Are you a fan of the Kardashians?

00:19:33.057 --> 00:19:34.707
Are they popular in your country?

00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:39.787
Can you see the influence of the Kardashians walking around your town or city?

00:19:40.397 --> 00:19:44.907
And what do you think the rise of the Kardashians tells us about society?

00:19:45.687 --> 00:19:48.667
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

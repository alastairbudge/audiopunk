Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:15.714
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:21.154
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:27.964
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The World Bank.

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:31.884
Now you have probably heard of The World Bank.

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:35.874
You’ll have heard the name on the news, read about it in

00:00:35.874 --> 00:00:39.924
the newspaper perhaps, but do you really know what it does?

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:46.264
It might sound like a dreadfully boring institution but it is an important

00:00:46.264 --> 00:00:51.594
one and it has had a huge impact on countries all over the world.

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:59.964
So in today’s episode we are going to lift the curtain and find out everything about The World Bank.

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:05.254
Before we get right into that though, let me just remind you that

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:09.764
you can get all of the bonus episodes, plus subtitles, transcripts,

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:14.914
and key vocabulary over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:19.574
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English,

00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:25.114
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:30.464
exchanging ideas, and generally, improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:34.424
So if that is of interest, and I certainly hope it

00:01:34.424 --> 00:01:38.674
is, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:42.614
Right then let's get started.

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:48.561
Let's begin with a few facts and a bit of history, and then we can

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:52.591
get into a couple of stories that will help bring this to life.

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:57.601
So, The World Bank is, of course, a bank.

00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:02.781
But it’s not a bank like the one that you or I might have an account with.

00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:08.621
It’s a lot more than that, and it’s a lot more exciting than your or my bank.

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.519
The World Bank was created towards the end of the Second World War, in 1944.

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:21.129
It came out of a long conference at a place called Bretton Woods, in the

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.989
United States, where economists and leaders from countries all over the world

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:33.099
came to try to agree on a global financial system for after the war was over.

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.669
They agreed on lots of different things, and we

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.869
aren’t going to go into everything in today’s episode.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.699
But what was clear was that large parts of the world,

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.439
especially in Europe, had been ravaged by years of war.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.339
Towns, cities, and industries were destroyed.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.629
Countries had been spending all of their money fighting World War Two, and

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.989
were now not only without any of the factories or industry to get back on

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.289
their feet, but they also didn’t have any money to invest in this recovery.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.579
And if the aftermath of World War One had taught people anything, it

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.699
is that it is in everyone’s interest for countries to grow and prosper.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.439
After the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was put into such a binding

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.529
position that it was always going to struggle to recover, which led to

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:40.839
hyperinflation, the rise of the Nazis, and well we all know what happened next.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:48.939
So, with this learning, a group of Allied countries set out to try to avoid this happening

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:56.629
again, and to figure out a way to jump-start the economic recovery of war-ravaged Europe.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.399
This was one of the main objectives of the Bretton Woods conference.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.929
Probably the two most important, and most famous things to come out of this

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:15.109
conference were the World Bank, and The IMF, the International Monetary Fund.

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.159
Now, it’s worth just explaining the difference between

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.809
the two because, well, it’s not all that clear.

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:30.619
The IMF even has a big page on its website saying how it’s different to the World Bank,

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:37.129
and says that even John Maynard Keynes, one of the most famous economists of the twentieth

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:43.645
century, and a founding father of both institutions, even he was confused by the names.

00:04:45.145 --> 00:04:51.615
The easiest way to think about the difference between the two is that the IMF is a sort of

00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:59.095
regulatory organisation that has the job of making sure that the international monetary system works

00:04:59.255 --> 00:05:05.155
- it makes sure that currencies don’t collapse, and that things just tick over in the background.

00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:10.585
That, of course, is a great simplification, but you get my drift.

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:17.275
The World Bank has a different objective, and that is to help countries develop.

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:21.405
Now, we’ll come on to the criticisms that it has faced

00:05:21.415 --> 00:05:25.335
in a minute, but at least this is the stated objective.

00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:34.355
Now, at least, the World Bank has only two goals that it wants to achieve by the year 2030.

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:41.835
The first goal is to “end extreme poverty by decreasing the percentage

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:47.825
of people living on less than $1.90 a day to no more than 3 percent.”

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:54.425
And the second goal is to “Promote shared prosperity by fostering

00:05:54.605 --> 00:05:58.955
the income growth of the bottom 40 percent for every country”.

00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:05.665
So, its mission now is to help the people in the world that most need its help.

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:11.965
The world’s poorest people, and also the bottom 40 percent of people in every country.

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:20.405
When it was first created, in 1944, the mission was similar, but slightly different.

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:27.555
It was to get the war-torn countries back on their feet, giving them low-interest

00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:33.065
loans to invest in repairing their countries, and allowing them to build

00:06:33.075 --> 00:06:39.435
factories, schools, hospitals, and all the things that a functioning society needs.

00:06:40.935 --> 00:06:46.505
After these European countries got back on their feet, the World Bank turned

00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:51.955
its attention towards what they called at the time developing countries.

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:59.302
The principle of how they helped these countries was the same as what they had done in Europe.

00:06:59.922 --> 00:07:04.432
They are a bank, of sorts at least, and they gave these countries

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:08.652
low-interest loans so they could invest in their development.

00:07:09.832 --> 00:07:14.582
The broad idea behind it was that poor countries need infrastructure to develop,

00:07:15.052 --> 00:07:21.292
so roads, railways, power stations and so on - but they didn’t have the money to

00:07:21.292 --> 00:07:26.163
invest in these kind of things, and so they would really struggle to get out of

00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:32.373
this cycle of poverty, and to move from ‘developing country’ to ‘developed country’.

00:07:33.323 --> 00:07:39.963
The World Bank had the money, and so if it could just transfer this money to the countries that

00:07:39.973 --> 00:07:46.103
needed it, then they would be able to invest in the things that they needed to develop, they would

00:07:46.103 --> 00:07:52.563
repay the loans, because they were now making more money, and everyone would be happy ever after.

00:07:54.063 --> 00:07:55.123
That was the idea.

00:07:55.523 --> 00:08:02.783
But, as is often the case, things that look good on paper, don’t always work out so well in the

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:09.903
real world, and the World Bank has come under a lot of criticism for the way in which it dealt

00:08:10.023 --> 00:08:17.323
with countries, and the impact of these World Bank loans has not always been as anticipated.

00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:23.223
The first thing to say is that World Bank loans normally

00:08:23.223 --> 00:08:27.563
require some form of what’s called Structural Adjustment.

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:33.783
That might sound like a complicated term, but you could just translate it into plain

00:08:33.783 --> 00:08:39.833
English as ‘if we give you this money, we need you to make some changes to how you operate’.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:46.023
These changes normally involved things like opening up that country’s

00:08:46.023 --> 00:08:52.763
economy to foreign companies, and things like privatising public assets.

00:08:54.263 --> 00:08:59.133
The theory goes that private companies are more efficient than governments,

00:08:59.443 --> 00:09:05.133
and so by opening up an economy to market competition, that country

00:09:05.153 --> 00:09:10.093
would become more efficient, develop faster, and everyone would benefit.

00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:14.323
The country would continue to grow, as they had more money

00:09:14.323 --> 00:09:17.963
to invest in infrastructure, that they so desperately needed.

00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:23.013
The citizens' incomes would rise, because there were more jobs available.

00:09:23.653 --> 00:09:29.073
The companies would be happy, because they would be able to access new projects in these countries.

00:09:29.393 --> 00:09:34.033
And the World Bank would be happy, because its loans would be repaid,

00:09:34.343 --> 00:09:37.513
as the country would now be making enough money to repay them.

00:09:38.483 --> 00:09:39.883
Everyone wins, right?

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.563
Of course, this didn’t always happen.

00:09:43.343 --> 00:09:47.633
One of the most famous examples of the impact of this Structural

00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:51.543
Adjustment is in Bolivia, with the Cochabamba Water War.

00:09:53.283 --> 00:09:56.223
Bolivia had been struggling with poor economic growth

00:09:56.663 --> 00:10:00.013
ever since it escaped from its military dictatorship.

00:10:00.863 --> 00:10:08.303
It had been going through a period of hyperinflation, with rates at 25,000% per year.

00:10:09.803 --> 00:10:15.183
With such a problematic economy, no other country or financial institution

00:10:15.393 --> 00:10:20.953
was willing to lend Bolivia money, so it turned to The World Bank.

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:28.623
The World Bank agreed to provide it with a series of loans, however these came

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:34.313
with strict conditions, including opening up the economy to private companies.

00:10:36.063 --> 00:10:41.763
In the city of Cochabamba, which is the third largest in Bolivia, access

00:10:41.763 --> 00:10:47.643
to water supplies was very poor, and as part of the condition of the

00:10:47.643 --> 00:10:53.083
World Bank loan, it required the privatisation of the water supply.

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:59.103
Control over the water was given to a giant consortium of

00:10:59.113 --> 00:11:03.543
international companies led by an American company called Bechtel.

00:11:05.013 --> 00:11:08.593
They planned to make significant investments in the

00:11:08.593 --> 00:11:12.603
water supplies, including building a huge new dam.

00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:19.037
As part of this, and in order to recoup the money that they would be

00:11:19.037 --> 00:11:24.867
investing, they decided to raise the price of water by about 35 percent.

00:11:26.377 --> 00:11:30.653
This meant that water would cost about $20 a month.

00:11:31.813 --> 00:11:36.653
They thought - $20 a month, that’s not that much, and they seemed

00:11:36.983 --> 00:11:40.883
to just assume that this would be all ok with the local people.

00:11:42.113 --> 00:11:42.973
It wasn’t.

00:11:43.773 --> 00:11:48.593
$20 was more than the average person in Cochabamba spent on

00:11:48.593 --> 00:11:53.803
food per month, and the average wage was around $100 a month.

00:11:54.293 --> 00:11:56.063
People simply couldn’t afford it.

00:11:57.523 --> 00:12:03.053
The managers of this private company seemed to not understand the gravity of the

00:12:03.053 --> 00:12:10.273
situation, and one foreign manager said “if they don’t pay, we’ll just turn the water off”.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:18.243
What’s more, the Bolivian government passed a law that said that this foreign company had the

00:12:18.243 --> 00:12:25.793
rights to all of the water in the area - even the water that fell from the sky and would be

00:12:25.793 --> 00:12:32.803
collected by individuals in buckets, even that water was technically owned by this foreign company.

00:12:34.303 --> 00:12:36.756
Enough was enough for the local people.

00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:42.416
How was it possibly fair that the rain was now owned by a foreign company?

00:12:43.186 --> 00:12:47.156
They were extorting money from the common people, and this

00:12:47.156 --> 00:12:51.176
was all enabled by taking the money from the World Bank.

00:12:52.556 --> 00:12:58.276
There were riots in the street, and a seventeen year old boy was killed by the police.

00:12:59.776 --> 00:13:05.826
The protests did work, and finally the Bolivian government agreed to the protestors'

00:13:05.846 --> 00:13:11.056
demands, and the control of the water supply was handed back to the people.

00:13:12.626 --> 00:13:18.256
There have been numerous incidents like this over the past few decades, cases of

00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:25.326
World Bank loans coming with these strict conditions, and the life for common people,

00:13:25.556 --> 00:13:31.266
the very people that the Bank is pledging to support, getting worse, not better.

00:13:32.766 --> 00:13:38.726
But, in the interests of diplomacy, let’s for one minute take the side of the World Bank,

00:13:39.156 --> 00:13:45.066
and try to understand why these structural adjustment requirements are part of the deal.

00:13:46.796 --> 00:13:50.316
Firstly, the Bank is a bank, not a charity.

00:13:50.806 --> 00:13:56.066
The money isn’t money that's coming from nowhere, it is financed partly

00:13:56.126 --> 00:14:00.356
from the bank’s members, and also from other loans from investors.

00:14:01.403 --> 00:14:08.243
The Bank wants to get its money back, and its view is that it has the best possible chance of doing

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:15.053
so if it requires the country to whom it is lending the money to make some changes to its economy.

00:14:16.763 --> 00:14:21.113
So from this point of view, it is sort of understandable.

00:14:21.613 --> 00:14:24.193
They aren’t doing it for completely no reason.

00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:32.413
The final question I guess we need to ask ourselves, though, is do World Bank loans work?

00:14:33.993 --> 00:14:41.623
If we take the example of the first ever World Bank loan, to France back in 1947, in

00:14:41.623 --> 00:14:48.223
order to rebuild its economy after the end of World War Two, you would probably say, sure.

00:14:48.953 --> 00:14:52.913
France is the world’s 7th largest economy, and people

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:56.373
there generally enjoy a pretty high standard of living.

00:14:57.713 --> 00:15:05.463
But looking at some of the more recent World Bank projects, the results aren’t always so clear.

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:11.313
Not only are the examples of countries that have pulled themselves out of

00:15:11.313 --> 00:15:15.783
poverty thanks to World Bank loans quite rare, there aren’t very many of

00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:22.693
them, but this debt, the loans from the World Bank, it doesn’t just go away.

00:15:23.383 --> 00:15:29.143
The interest needs to be paid every year, and if a country hasn’t managed to

00:15:29.163 --> 00:15:35.523
improve its economic outlook, and generate more money, then it still needs to pay.

00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:43.133
The result of this is that many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa are

00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:50.053
stuck with these huge debt repayments, and in many countries of the global South,

00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:57.143
the amount spent each year repaying public debt comes to more than the amount

00:15:57.163 --> 00:16:03.380
spent on education, health, rural development and job creation all put together.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:10.130
So these countries are spending more on repaying these loans than

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:15.050
they are now on investing in their people, which, of course, is the

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.530
complete opposite of the originally intended purpose of the World Bank.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:28.920
So the World Bank is not without some fair criticism, and it is obvious that it is far from perfect.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:36.140
Its aims may be positive - and to remind you, they are, by the year 2030- and I'm

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.100
quoting directly here - they are to “end extreme poverty by decreasing the percentage of

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:50.040
people living on less than $1.90 a day to no more than 3 percent” and to “Promote shared

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:55.890
prosperity by fostering the income growth of the bottom 40 percent for every country”

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:03.670
So their aims may be good, but it is clear that their methods come with a cost.

00:17:04.796 --> 00:17:09.916
And if you ask the people of Cochabamba, I think you’d probably find

00:17:09.936 --> 00:17:14.646
them saying that the cost is not one that they would be willing to pay.

00:17:16.786 --> 00:17:20.306
OK then, that is it for the World Bank.

00:17:20.776 --> 00:17:24.426
We have, of course, only scratched the surface.

00:17:24.816 --> 00:17:30.526
It is a huge organisation, involved in a vast amount of different projects and

00:17:30.526 --> 00:17:36.536
activities but I hope this has at least given you an idea of what it does, how

00:17:36.536 --> 00:17:41.366
it does it, and what some of the impacts are for people all over the world.

00:17:42.736 --> 00:17:45.836
As always I would love to know what you thought of the show.

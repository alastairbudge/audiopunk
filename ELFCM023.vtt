Alastair Budge: Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:10.588
by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:16.558
I'm Alastair Budge and welcome to the show where you can learn English while learning fascinating

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:23.128
things about the way the world works, and of course about how to learn English in an effective,

00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:25.588
interesting and engaging way.

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:32.608
In today's episode, we are going to be talking about the most common mistakes people make when

00:00:32.608 --> 00:00:34.678
learning English and how to avoid them.

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:42.468
So it's a slight deviation from our usual topics of weird and wonderful things that happen in the

00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:49.008
world, but we've had quite a lot of you asking for more material, specifically on English learning,

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:55.158
and if you are interested in learning English, which I guess if you're listening to this podcast,

00:00:55.158 --> 00:01:01.938
you probably are, it's probably a good thing to be aware of some of the mistakes that you should be

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:02.738
avoiding.

00:01:04.088 --> 00:01:11.718
If you are hoping to hear specifics in this podcast about phrasal verbs or people making mistakes in

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:15.878
pronouncing a particular word, then I'm sorry to disappoint you.

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:24.173
We aren't going to be talking about specific mistakes people make, but rather strategic mistakes in

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:30.563
terms of the approach that you take when learning English, so mistakes that people make, no matter

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:34.553
what their mother tongue is or how long they've been learning English.

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:42.683
As we go through these common mistakes, if you recognise things that you do, well, then we'll talk

00:01:42.683 --> 00:01:44.333
about ways you can avoid doing them.

00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:50.798
And if we talk about mistakes that you know that you don't make, well, you can give yourself a

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:52.298
little pat on the back.

00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:58.340
Before we get right into it, let me just say that nobody is perfect.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.790
I'm certainly not, and don't feel disheartened if you notice some of your own behaviour in some of

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.410
the things that we'll talk about today.

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:15.845
Fixing some of these mistakes isn't always easy, and learning English isn't full of quick fixes and

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:22.775
hacks, but if you can avoid making these mistakes, then you'll find yourself progressing a lot

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.205
faster than you would do otherwise.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:33.335
As I was making my notes for this podcast, it became obvious that if I tried to squeeze everything

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:37.895
into one podcast, well it would end up being quite long.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:41.285
So we are going to split this podcast into two parts.

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:48.037
You are listening to part one and part two will be zooming into your podcast app of choice in the

00:02:48.037 --> 00:02:54.817
next episode, which should be on Friday, so make sure that you hit that subscribe or follow button

00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:57.127
if you haven't done so already.

00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:04.126
As a quick reminder for those who have listened before, and just a point to note for those who are

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:09.526
listening to this podcast for the first time, you can grab a copy of the transcript and key

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:14.926
vocabulary for this podcast over on the website, which is leonardoenglish.com.

00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:22.757
The transcripts and key vocabulary are super helpful for following every word, and comes with

00:03:22.757 --> 00:03:29.417
definitions of the more unusual words or phrases, meaning you end up boosting your vocabulary with

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:30.677
every single podcast.

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:37.692
All right then, today we are talking about the mistakes that people make when learning English, but

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:40.512
a lot of these can be applied to almost any language.

00:03:41.172 --> 00:03:47.742
Again, we are talking about mistakes in approach, not specific mistakes with vocabulary, grammar,

00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:49.542
pronunciation, or anything like that.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.219
For each mistake, we'll talk through what the mistake is, why it's bad, and what you can do to fix

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:57.399
it.

00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:06.681
So without further ado, our first mistake is one that so many English students make, and that is to

00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:09.681
use materials that aren't interesting to them.

00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:16.461
Materials that are designed just for language schools or to be used in the classroom.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:25.371
These are often artificial, staged situations and they're not really interesting at all.

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:32.196
I'm sure if you close your eyes now and just think of some materials that you might have used in an

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:35.436
English class, they're probably not particularly interesting.

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:44.016
The result of this is that you can find yourself getting bored, you can't motivate yourself and you

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:52.026
can't concentrate as well, and the study of language becomes a chore, something boring to do, not a

00:04:52.026 --> 00:04:52.536
pleasure.

00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:54.981
Does this sound familiar?

00:04:55.701 --> 00:04:57.891
I guess to many of you it probably does.

00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:00.621
So how can you avoid it?

00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:03.711
Well, it's actually quite easy really.

00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:11.631
Just read or listen to content that hasn't been dulled down specifically for language learners.

00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:20.391
Films, books, series about things that you're actually interested in, or podcasts like this, I hope,

00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:27.501
where you are learning something over and above basic language and not just listening to staged

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:34.461
conversations or boring small-talk where you aren't actually learning anything over and above

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:35.091
language.

00:05:36.561 --> 00:05:43.011
If you surround yourself with what I call "real English", content that talks about things that you

00:05:43.011 --> 00:05:48.935
are interested in, it suddenly won't seem quite so much like learning.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:57.575
Motivation is one of the key factors in people's progress and success, and the easier it is to keep

00:05:57.575 --> 00:06:05.075
yourself motivated, well then the easier it will be for you to concentrate and to keep on moving

00:06:05.075 --> 00:06:05.555
forward.

00:06:07.144 --> 00:06:13.362
Our next mistake is to constantly judge yourself against the progress of others.

00:06:14.412 --> 00:06:20.832
Everyone learns at a different pace using different techniques and different things work for

00:06:20.832 --> 00:06:21.612
different people.

00:06:22.468 --> 00:06:30.824
I'm part of all sorts of different Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram groups, and I always amazed at how

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:38.354
often people ask the same questions comparing themselves against others in terms of their learning

00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:39.134
of English.

00:06:39.437 --> 00:06:42.919
Stuff like "guys, how often do you practice vocabulary?"

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:49.039
Or "I'm trying to read an article on the BBC and I can't understand anything - what am I doing

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:49.549
wrong?"

00:06:51.034 --> 00:06:57.454
It's completely natural to want to engage with other learners and understand how your progress

00:06:57.484 --> 00:07:04.774
compares to theirs, but everyone is learning at their own pace using things that work for them.

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:13.324
By all means, try out different tactics, but you will find out what works for you and you shouldn't

00:07:13.324 --> 00:07:17.674
be comparing yourself constantly to the progress of others.

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:25.949
The great thing about learning English is that it's not a competition, it's not a zero-sum thing, so

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:32.849
there really is little to be gained by constantly comparing yourself to others who are learning

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:33.209
English.

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:41.699
Assuming that you are now at an intermediate level or above, and I guess given that you are

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:48.329
listening to this podcast, you should be, then you should have a decent enough idea of the

00:07:48.329 --> 00:07:56.849
techniques and strategies that work for you and endlessly comparing yourself to others means you're

00:07:56.849 --> 00:08:04.574
not only distracting yourself from the core task of engaging with English content, but you are also

00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:11.144
more likely to be distracted, to be caught up by the next shiny thing or new technique.

00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:14.744
So the more you can avoid this, the better.

00:08:16.947 --> 00:08:24.584
This brings me on to the next mistake, which is what I call taking the easy option or looking for

00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:26.354
shortcuts, looking for hacks.

00:08:27.344 --> 00:08:33.464
This is something that actually pains me to see, and it's something that I see all the time with

00:08:33.494 --> 00:08:34.364
language learners.

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:41.860
In the era of people thinking that there must be a hack, a shortcut for everything, a quick solution

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.740
that means that you don't need to put in the hours, this is becoming increasingly prominent.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:56.320
And lots of people seem to spend hours searching for hacks, for shortcuts, that will mean that they

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.580
don't actually have to put in time learning the language.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:09.240
So no, just putting on English songs while you sleep won't make you wake up miraculously one month

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.030
later and find that you're speaking with a perfect British accent.

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:21.194
Learning a language, learning English does take time, and the mistake that people make is to try to

00:09:21.194 --> 00:09:28.274
think of this time as a boring, necessary task that they want to get through as quickly as possible,

00:09:28.889 --> 00:09:32.249
so they can minimise the amount of time that they spend doing this.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:39.789
Thinking about it like this is just framing it in completely the wrong way Instead, you should

00:09:39.789 --> 00:09:42.879
embrace the actual language learning process.

00:09:43.119 --> 00:09:46.659
Remind yourself of why you are learning English in the first place.

00:09:47.344 --> 00:09:54.394
Remind yourself of the goal that you have in mind, be that to get a job, to be able to talk about

00:09:54.394 --> 00:09:59.314
more than basic subjects with your colleagues, or to feel more at ease in an English speaking

00:09:59.314 --> 00:10:07.084
country, and then stop looking for hacks and shortcuts and embrace the actual process of learning.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:15.960
Thinking of needing a hack makes language learning sound boring and tedious, but it should be the

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.710
opposite.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:24.840
Relish it and suddenly looking for elusive hacks, hacks that are difficult to find and actually

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.090
don't exist, suddenly looking for these won't be so attractive anymore.

00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:40.263
Our next mistake, which is something that almost everyone suffers from to a certain degree, is the

00:10:40.263 --> 00:10:41.943
fear of making mistakes.

00:10:42.768 --> 00:10:49.878
Now I'm sure that you've heard this before, and being told, "don't be afraid", is about as useful as

00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:52.158
being hit in the face with a wet fish.

00:10:52.578 --> 00:10:55.608
So I will not patronise you by saying that.

00:10:57.138 --> 00:11:03.528
Instead, I'll give you a few tips of things you can do to actually help get over this.

00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:10.848
So, first thing to do is to think about the reasons why you are afraid and the things you can do to

00:11:10.848 --> 00:11:11.928
get over this fear.

00:11:13.448 --> 00:11:19.928
It's completely natural that you, assuming that you are a adult who is a fluent, confident, and

00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:26.498
literate person in your mother tongue, it's completely natural that you feel like you're a different

00:11:26.498 --> 00:11:32.623
person when you are speaking English, you can't express yourself in the same way.

00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:41.118
In fact, even the most fluent of English learners, people who have lived in English speaking

00:11:41.118 --> 00:11:48.318
countries for many years, they often can't express themselves in exactly the same way as they would

00:11:48.648 --> 00:11:50.538
if they were speaking in their mother tongue.

00:11:51.828 --> 00:11:57.828
You often feel like a different person, unable to communicate in the same way as you could do if you

00:11:57.828 --> 00:11:59.358
were speaking in your mother tongue.

00:12:00.018 --> 00:12:03.768
So it's completely natural to feel afraid of speaking.

00:12:04.278 --> 00:12:12.138
It's almost always easier to nod pleasantly, to, to nod your head up and down rather than to try out

00:12:12.138 --> 00:12:16.518
a new structure or word because you're afraid that you might make a mistake.

00:12:17.778 --> 00:12:20.538
But without trying, you're not going to learn.

00:12:21.078 --> 00:12:28.158
And if your objective is to learn, which it has to be, then if you don't try, you won't learn.

00:12:29.363 --> 00:12:36.023
Remember, and I say this as someone with a non-native English speaking wife, a large percentage of

00:12:36.023 --> 00:12:42.143
my friends being non-native English and also someone who spends a large part of his life speaking

00:12:42.143 --> 00:12:48.923
languages that aren't my native English, and feeling fearful myself, we just need to remember that

00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:56.573
people don't actually care when you make mistakes and also in all probability, you make fewer

00:12:56.573 --> 00:12:58.313
mistakes than you think you do.

00:13:00.453 --> 00:13:05.400
I've got a good story here, which I think will be interesting and relevant for a lot of you.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:11.910
So I have got a great friend, a Sicilian called Francesco, who is actually the godfather to my son.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:20.220
He arrived in London in 2013, I think it was, without speaking a word of English.

00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:29.235
Fast forward a few years and he is now doing a PhD, a doctorate at the University of Cambridge on a

00:13:29.235 --> 00:13:30.195
full scholarship.

00:13:31.605 --> 00:13:39.675
Now, this might sound completely implausible to you, but the difference between many English

00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:46.225
learners and Francesco isn't aptitude or natural talent.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:50.460
It's probably that he had absolutely no fear.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:58.950
He made hundreds of mistakes every day, but he always did so with a big smile on his face, as well

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.130
as a very large Sicilian moustache.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:09.600
And the result was that he was able to get to a really good level of English, good enough to get

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.850
into a PhD program at one of the most prestigious universities in the world.

00:14:15.885 --> 00:14:22.725
So people don't care when you make mistakes and the sooner you understand that every mistake you

00:14:22.725 --> 00:14:29.445
make is an opportunity to learn the sooner you'll get over this fear and the faster you'll learn.

00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:39.900
Our final mistake for part one is one that actually a lot of people make, and this applies equally

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.430
to English native speakers.

00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:46.485
So this is to try to speak too fast.

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:55.035
People from some countries are particularly guilty of this, so unfortunately I'm going to single out

00:14:55.065 --> 00:15:02.445
the Spanish speakers, um, you often speak very fast but it is a mistake that people from almost

00:15:02.475 --> 00:15:04.125
every country make.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:14.640
You might equate fluency with the speed at which you speak, but actually there's not really anything

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.410
fluent about this.

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:25.860
As a non-native speaker, you might see another non-native speaker speaking English very fast and

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.030
mistake this for fluency or a high level of English.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:35.130
But actually often it is completely the opposite.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:43.860
Lots of people try to speak too fast and end up making mistakes that they wouldn't have made if they

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.420
spoke more slowly.

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:54.709
Plus, if you speak more slowly, especially as your pronunciation is likely, still going to be

00:15:54.709 --> 00:16:03.271
different, a little bit different, to that of a native speaker, you will be easier to understand and

00:16:03.271 --> 00:16:06.331
you will make life easier for the person you're speaking to.

00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:16.281
In fact, some of the most impressive orators in English speak very slowly and with frequent pauses

00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:18.411
between words and sentences.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:26.916
Barack Obama, for example, is almost universally acknowledged to be a fantastic orator.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:38.088
If you listen to Obama speaking, he speaks very slowly and frequently pauses almost as if he is just

00:16:38.538 --> 00:16:40.863
searching for the right word.

00:16:42.733 --> 00:16:48.523
He also doesn't hesitate and fall back into um, or ah, or ugh, words.

00:16:49.873 --> 00:16:59.983
The result is that he comes across as an incredibly talented speaker, someone with a fantastic way

00:17:00.013 --> 00:17:02.773
with words and ability with language.

00:17:04.363 --> 00:17:07.663
So what can you do to fix this mistake?

00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:10.963
Well, it's pretty easy.

00:17:11.473 --> 00:17:13.123
Speak more slowly.

00:17:13.993 --> 00:17:19.573
Speaking quickly really isn't a proxy for linguistic ability.

00:17:20.023 --> 00:17:22.963
The faster you speak does not mean the better you speak.

00:17:23.653 --> 00:17:32.623
If you have one person who speaks at 75 words a minute, but uses more nuanced structures, more

00:17:32.623 --> 00:17:41.293
advanced vocabulary and better grammar versus another who speaks at 150 words a minute, so twice as

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:50.083
fast, but isn't so easy to understand and makes errors, well, I think you can guess which one will

00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:53.323
come across as the more accomplished English speaker.

00:17:56.198 --> 00:18:02.678
Okay then in the interests of keeping every podcast under 20 minutes so that they are bite-sized and

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:08.738
easy to fit into your day, we are going to call this a day for part one of this list.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:16.118
Stay tuned for part two where we'll go through the remaining five of our top mistakes that people

00:18:16.118 --> 00:18:19.808
make when learning English, and there's also one little bonus one at the end.

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:29.438
As a sneak peak, you'll learn why focusing on grammar can be detrimental, why people don't listen

00:18:29.438 --> 00:18:36.308
properly, why you shouldn't feel the need to go to an English speaking country to do an immersion

00:18:36.308 --> 00:18:36.698
course.

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:45.736
I'll give you some tips on fitting your English into your already busy day and how to set manageable

00:18:45.736 --> 00:18:52.306
goals that will put you on the right path and mean that you can continue your momentum with your

00:18:52.306 --> 00:18:52.666
learning.

00:18:53.536 --> 00:18:56.026
That's all to come in part two.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.440
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.630
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.910
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Mazher Mahmood.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.080
For years, few people knew his name, or even knew what he looked like.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.890
They knew him by another name, “The Fake Sheikh”, or “The King of The Sting”.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.030
See, Mahmood was an undercover journalist who pretended to be a rich Middle Eastern prince in

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.050
order to trick famous people into doing things, or revealing information, they would later regret.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.630
For decades his stories would be splashed on the front pages of the British

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.810
tabloid newspapers, revealing uncomfortable truths about the rich and the famous.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.680
His is an amazing story, but it would later be revealed that some of these

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.070
uncomfortable truths weren’t quite as true as the public had been led to believe…

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.630
Ok then, let's get right into it and talk about The Fake Sheikh.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.660
If you have ever played the British version of the game Monopoly,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.510
you’ll know that “Mayfair” is the most expensive property on the board.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.550
If you happen to land on Mayfair, you’ll pay a minimum of £200 in rent.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.300
If your opponent has a hotel, it’s £2,000, enough

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.870
to bankrupt a player without a healthy bank balance.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.720
And one day in 2010, in real-life Mayfair, which is to this day the most expensive

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.250
district of central London, two people were sitting across a glass table.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.890
One was Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.860
the now-disgraced younger brother of King Charles.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.400
She had been divorced from Prince Andrew for 14 years, but the two had remained close friends.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.290
Ferguson was drinking red wine, but she was by no means drunk.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.520
Across the table from her was a man who had been introduced to her as

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.140
a wealthy Middle Eastern Sheikh, a prince, someone with deep pockets.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.770
The sheikh had money, and Ferguson had connections in the form of her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, who

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.570
was not only in line to the throne, but also the UK special representative for trade and investment.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.310
Essentially this was a diplomatic position where he went around the world

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.070
supposedly promoting the UK as a country to trade with and invest in.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.970
The pair got down to business.

00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:10.580
Ferguson offered the sheikh access to her husband, saying “Look after me and he'll look after you.”

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:19.050
Or to translate this into even more plain English, do what I want and he will do what you want.

00:03:20.426 --> 00:03:25.750
And what did she want in exchange for this, in exchange for access to Prince Andrew?

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.890
£400,000, which is around €700,000 in today’s money.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.260
The problem was, as you have probably guessed from

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.220
the title of this episode, the sheikh wasn’t a sheikh.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.310
This wealthy Middle Eastern prince was a journalist called Mazher Mahmood.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.450
He was recording everything with a series of microphones and hidden cameras.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.330
And weeks later this would be front page news, disgracing Sarah Ferguson and understandably

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.430
causing questions to be asked about Prince Andrew’s suitability for this diplomatic position.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.040
As it would later transpire, this would pale in comparison to some of the

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.480
other accusations against Prince Andrew, but that’s a story for another day.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.040
Now, this time wasn’t the first, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last, that this

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.130
man, this fake sheikh, would expose and embarrass the rich and famous, and it

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.580
was only one episode in a four-decade long career as an investigative journalist.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.200
So, who was this man, this fake sheikh, who did he

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.200
expose, how did he do it, and what is he up to now?

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.740
He was born in Birmingham in 1963.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.650
Both of his parents were journalists who had left their

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.450
homeland of Pakistan to come and settle in Britain.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.730
His father had started the first Urdu-language newspaper in

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.910
Britain, and had encouraged his son to follow in his footsteps.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.090
Mahmood was only too keen to follow.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.730
He left school with only a handful of qualifications,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.510
and found that breaking into journalism was hard.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.150
He knocked on doors, sent applications, but found rejection after rejection.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.820
He would later say that he felt his Pakistani ethnicity

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.460
held him back in the white-dominated British newsrooms.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.340
In fact, it would be his Pakistani heritage that would go on to help him later on, allowing him

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.240
to slip into his trademark Middle Eastern Sheikh disguise without arousing too much suspicion.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.130
He started as a freelancer, and got his big break with an investigation that

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.360
would be a blueprint for everything else in his career: it exposed people, it was

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.850
controversial, and it showed a clear disregard for any kind of personal consequences.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.230
This was in 1980, when he was only 18.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.130
He had learned from conversations with his family over the dinner table that there was a

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:19.420
burgeoning trade in illegal videos in Birmingham, where people would make recordings of

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.670
films that were out in the cinema, then these would be copied and sold, illegally, of course.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:34.320
He went undercover and wrote an expose, a story, about this, hitting publish despite knowing he

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.480
was exposing the son of a close family friend who was involved in the pirate video operation.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.620
It would be the start of a career that would last four decades, and go on

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.670
to expose people far better known than pirate video sellers in Birmingham.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.370
He worked for a variety of different British newspapers, from The Sunday Times to The Sunday

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.390
People, but he would be most famously associated with a newspaper called The News of The World.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.140
If you remember our episodes on British tabloids from a few weeks

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.890
back, yes this is the same disgraced newspaper that was revealed to

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.550
have hacked people’s voicemails and was forced to shut down in 2011.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.283
He joined The News of The World full-time in 1991,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.510
and focussed exclusively on investigative journalism.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.740
And his journalism, his stories, went something like this: He would have a

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.970
hypothesis, or a tip, that someone was up to something that they shouldn’t be.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.260
He would do everything he could to get close to that person and validate that hypothesis.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.780
He would record the entire conversation, without that person’s knowledge of

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.850
course, and then it would be splashed on the front page of The News of The World.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.200
And vital for this was his disguise, his costume.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:05.310
Normally, he would wear flowing white robes, leading the subjects of his

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.900
investigation to believe that he was a wealthy Middle Eastern Sheikh.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.520
He used these robes, it would later transpire, somewhat by accident.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:21.440
There wasn’t some grand plan, he bought them for ten pounds, the equivalent of 20 euros or so,

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.150
behind an Islamic book store in Birmingham just hours before his first undercover operation.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.850
But they worked.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:35.170
He was clearly very convincing, people believed that he was who he said he was.

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:41.660
He looked like a sheikh, he talked like a sheikh, and he seemed to spend money like a sheikh.

00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:48.804
Now you might think that he was helped by the fact that lots of the subjects of his investigations

00:08:49.084 --> 00:08:54.564
didn’t really know what a sheikh would look like or how one would talk, and wouldn’t be fooled.

00:08:55.934 --> 00:08:58.394
But, this wasn't always the case.

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:03.434
Somewhat surprisingly, one of his most famous undercover

00:09:03.454 --> 00:09:07.914
stings, his investigations, was on Pakistani cricket players.

00:09:09.524 --> 00:09:16.119
This was in 2010, a few months after he had exposed Sarah Ferguson in that Mayfair apartment.

00:09:17.264 --> 00:09:22.264
Mahmood had received information that some of the Pakistani cricket team were

00:09:22.274 --> 00:09:27.534
accepting money to fix matches, to change the outcome of a cricket match.

00:09:28.824 --> 00:09:34.794
For this expose he didn’t actually pose as a sheikh, perhaps thinking it would be too obvious.

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:39.964
Instead, he chose the disguise of a wealthy Indian businessman who was

00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:44.174
interested in bringing Pakistani cricketers to play in an Indian tournament.

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:50.004
He managed to arrange a meeting with the players’ agent, in disguise of course.

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:56.774
In this meeting the agent agreed to accept a bribe on behalf of his players,

00:09:57.004 --> 00:10:03.004
which required them to bowl bad balls, essentially to make mistakes, at specified

00:10:03.014 --> 00:10:08.184
points during a cricket match at London’s most prestigious cricket ground, Lord’s.

00:10:09.714 --> 00:10:15.724
The entire conversation was caught on film, and on Sunday, the 29th of August,

00:10:15.944 --> 00:10:20.904
2010, the News of The World front cover had a picture of the cricketing

00:10:20.904 --> 00:10:27.234
agent with £150,000 in cash sitting in front of him on a coffee table.

00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:32.824
It was a huge story that rocked the cricketing world, and

00:10:32.994 --> 00:10:37.034
is to-date one of the biggest scandals in cricket history.

00:10:38.564 --> 00:10:44.504
In this case, Mahmood exposed corruption, he shone a light on dodgy dealings.

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:51.204
One can criticise his methods, but the result was positive from a public interest point of view.

00:10:52.734 --> 00:10:54.704
This wasn’t always the case.

00:10:56.194 --> 00:11:02.554
Earlier on in his career, back in 2002, Mahmood had exposed a huge story.

00:11:04.068 --> 00:11:07.958
Again, plastered over the front page of The News of The World was the

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:13.751
headline “POSH KIDNAP”, and the subheader “We stop crime of the century”.

00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:20.771
The story was that a gang was planning to kidnap Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham.

00:11:22.141 --> 00:11:27.911
The gang, so it was reported, had travelled to Italy to buy a special spray to

00:11:27.991 --> 00:11:32.641
knock her out, a safe house was earmarked, the gang was about to kidnap one of

00:11:32.641 --> 00:11:37.041
the country’s most famous pop stars and the wife of its most famous footballer.

00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:43.551
The police were tipped off, they were alerted by Mahmood with only three hours

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:48.111
before the kidnap was scheduled to take place, and the criminals were arrested.

00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:53.571
Victoria Beckham had been saved, with a matter of hours to spare.

00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:56.471
It sounds like a great story.

00:11:56.821 --> 00:11:58.591
I mean, it was a great story.

00:11:59.183 --> 00:12:02.471
But the problem was that it simply wasn’t true.

00:12:03.141 --> 00:12:07.081
There was no plot, and the people arrested by the police would be

00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:10.971
released shortly after when it became clear that they were innocent.

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:17.271
It would later be revealed that Mahmood’s information had been bought from a man who

00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:22.400
would be described as a “serial fantasist with a history of mental health problems.

00:12:22.545 --> 00:12:27.185
someone who simply invented stories to sell Mahmood in order to get paid.

00:12:28.191 --> 00:12:32.871
He had tried to sell Mahmood various different stories, which had been rejected.

00:12:33.591 --> 00:12:39.111
And it was only after he came to Mahmood with a story about Beckham that Mahmood accepted,

00:12:39.531 --> 00:12:44.831
without doing much in terms of due diligence or investigation about whether it was actually true.

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:51.471
And this was one of the main criticisms of Mahmood, that he was quick to

00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:57.201
accept stories that fitted a narrative or angle he was looking for, but that

00:12:57.201 --> 00:13:01.531
he chose to ignore information that might get in the way of a good story.

00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:07.211
He was also criticised for double standards, of expecting people

00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:11.281
to accept something but not being prepared to accept it himself.

00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:17.791
This is most obvious when seeing his obsession with keeping his own identity

00:13:17.791 --> 00:13:23.181
secret while his entire career was based on exposing the inner secrets of others.

00:13:24.181 --> 00:13:29.261
There are very few photos of Mahmood that exist, and even within The News of

00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:34.171
The World’s offices, very few people knew who he was or what he looked like.

00:13:35.551 --> 00:13:39.631
Of course, keeping his identity secret was an important part of his

00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:44.061
job - if everyone knew what he looked like or how he talked, then his

00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:48.044
ability to pretend to be someone else would be seriously jeopardised.

00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:53.181
But there is still a clear contradiction between his need for

00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:56.841
the utmost privacy and the stories he built his career on.

00:13:58.305 --> 00:14:03.025
And the other main criticism was about the tactics he used.

00:14:04.225 --> 00:14:08.465
As you’ve heard, his entire methodology involved tricking

00:14:08.465 --> 00:14:11.085
people into believing that he was someone he wasn’t.

00:14:11.575 --> 00:14:13.075
He lied, and tricked.

00:14:13.315 --> 00:14:18.865
He would try to get people drunk, so that they would reveal truths they wouldn’t reveal when sober.

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:24.485
He would pay people large amounts of money to get information, information that would be

00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:31.805
used to bring them down and in some cases, ruin their careers and result in jail sentences.

00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:37.535
And nowhere were his methods, and their consequences, better

00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:40.905
illustrated than the last example I want to talk about today.

00:14:42.025 --> 00:14:47.215
This was also The Fake Sheikh’s last story, or at least his last major

00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:51.785
investigation, and it would go on to cost him his job and career.

00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:55.755
This story wasn’t for The News of The World.

00:14:56.115 --> 00:15:01.865
That particular tabloid had been forced to shut down in 2011, but Mahmood had

00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:07.085
moved on to another tabloid newspaper, The Sun, which published similar stories.

00:15:08.568 --> 00:15:15.138
And by this point, in 2013, Mahmood was in his fourth decade of being The

00:15:15.138 --> 00:15:20.268
Fake Sheikh, he had been investigating and exposing people since 1980.

00:15:20.978 --> 00:15:25.328
He had well-honed techniques and methods, and they weren’t going to change.

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:33.568
His target this time was a lady called Tulisa Contostavlos, a 25-year-old who had made her name

00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:40.048
with a hip-hop band called N-Dubz, but had gone on to be a judge on the talent show “X-Factor”.

00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:46.608
Tulisa was on top of the world, she was on one of the country’s most popular TV shows.

00:15:46.948 --> 00:15:48.478
Life was going well for her.

00:15:49.668 --> 00:15:55.238
Then, on Sunday, June the 2nd, 2013, slapped across the headline

00:15:55.388 --> 00:16:01.128
of The Sun on Sunday the words read: Tulisa’s cocaine deal shame.

00:16:02.638 --> 00:16:05.898
The article revealed that Tulisa had arranged to

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:10.868
sell £800, about €1000, worth of cocaine to Mahmood.

00:16:12.448 --> 00:16:18.828
This was a serious allegation, that this celebrity TV judge was a drug dealer.

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.398
It also didn't seem to make much sense.

00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:26.358
She was a celebrity, she was making huge amounts of money, why

00:16:26.368 --> 00:16:29.728
would she be selling a comparatively small amount of drugs?

00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:37.438
She was arrested shortly after, her houses were searched, and she was charged by the police.

00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:44.398
Clearly, being a cocaine dealer is a serious crime, but was there any truth to it?

00:16:45.368 --> 00:16:50.438
Well, as often with Mazher Mahmood, there was some truth to it,

00:16:50.568 --> 00:16:54.788
but plenty of elaboration and cherry picking of information.

00:16:55.954 --> 00:17:00.308
Mahmood had posed as a wealthy Bollywood film producer who

00:17:00.308 --> 00:17:04.168
wanted to take Tulisa to India and turn her into a star.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:09.158
He had flown her to Hollywood and Las Vegas before returning to London.

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:16.348
They went for drinks at a London hotel, and Mahmood tried to get her as drunk as possible.

00:17:17.773 --> 00:17:22.648
Mahmood, of course posing still as this Bollywood producer, asks

00:17:22.668 --> 00:17:26.218
if Tulisa is able to arrange for someone to sell him cocaine.

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:31.518
She was very drunk at this point, but she said she would try to arrange it.

00:17:32.878 --> 00:17:36.978
That evening, Mahmood’s long-time driver, a man called Alan

00:17:36.978 --> 00:17:41.218
Smith, drove Tulisa back to her house on the outskirts of London.

00:17:42.708 --> 00:17:47.648
Two weeks later a friend of Tulisa’s delivers the drugs to Mahmood

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:53.518
at an upmarket London hotel, in exchange for £800, around €1,000.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.480
And the following Sunday the story was published, and Tulisa’s

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:05.110
reputation as a family-friendly TV judge was in tatters, it was ruined.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:12.520
Now, what was problematic about this, and why was it the start of the end for “The Fake Sheikh”?

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.170
Well, as part of the police investigation into the matter,

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.090
the police talked to Mahmood and his driver, Alan Smith.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:29.380
Smith told the police that during the car journey back there had been a heated argument about drugs.

00:18:30.329 --> 00:18:35.240
Tulisa told Smith she never used them, and disapproved of people

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.080
using drugs, because she had a family member with a drug problem.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.480
Smith told the police about this, but then later retracted

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.980
this part from his statement, saying that it never happened.

00:18:49.054 --> 00:18:55.866
It later transpired that Mahmood had told him to remove it, as Tulisa disapproving of people

00:18:55.866 --> 00:19:01.236
using drugs would get in the way of Mahmood's story, that this young lady was a drug dealer.

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:04.816
And this was a problem.

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:07.796
Not just a problem, it was a crime.

00:19:08.586 --> 00:19:12.546
The crime was called conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:17.026
Or in other words, trying to hide information from the police.

00:19:18.226 --> 00:19:21.546
There was a court trial, and the tables were turned.

00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:27.163
This time it was Mahmood that was in the dock, that was under investigation.

00:19:28.163 --> 00:19:32.323
He was found guilty, and sentenced to 15 months in prison.

00:19:33.553 --> 00:19:38.483
This was back in 2016, so he is now a free man, but is

00:19:38.483 --> 00:19:42.413
keeping a very low profile, hidden from the public eye.

00:19:43.713 --> 00:19:48.203
Now, this style of journalism, of extreme investigative

00:19:48.213 --> 00:19:51.993
journalism came under scrutiny during Mahmood’s trial.

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:58.753
To quote the prosecution:  “Over the last 25 years, innumerable

00:19:58.763 --> 00:20:03.303
lives have been ruined by the dishonest actions of Mazher Mahmood.

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:07.103
People have lost their livelihoods, their homes and

00:20:07.103 --> 00:20:09.993
relationships, with some spending time in prison.

00:20:10.923 --> 00:20:15.153
When the public used to read ‘Fake Sheikh’ articles in British newspapers,

00:20:15.503 --> 00:20:18.543
they would know there was a criminal at the heart of the story.

00:20:19.313 --> 00:20:26.827
Until now, readers didn’t realise that the criminal  was the ‘Fake Sheikh’ himself.” End quote.

00:20:27.917 --> 00:20:30.977
Now, it’s certainly true that Mahmood caused people’s

00:20:30.977 --> 00:20:34.607
reputations and in some cases lives to be ruined.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:39.847
We’ve only talked about a few of them today, but his subjects included football

00:20:39.857 --> 00:20:44.657
managers, other members of the royal family, TV and pop stars, and sports people.

00:20:45.517 --> 00:20:49.837
And it’s certainly true that Mahmood’s techniques were at best

00:20:49.947 --> 00:20:54.187
controversial, unorthodox and dishonest and at worst criminal.

00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:59.697
His story raises interesting and important questions about the

00:20:59.717 --> 00:21:03.287
nature of the public interest, and the right to people’s privacy.

00:21:04.517 --> 00:21:09.487
Do celebrities have the same right to privacy as everyone else, or does going

00:21:09.487 --> 00:21:14.407
on TV and making money from attention somehow open you up to greater scrutiny?

00:21:15.637 --> 00:21:20.097
Is it a good thing for investigative journalists to pry into the private lives

00:21:20.097 --> 00:21:25.077
of others and try to expose tendencies of bad, or even, criminal behaviour?

00:21:25.887 --> 00:21:29.387
Is it always a good thing, never or somewhere in the middle?

00:21:29.967 --> 00:21:31.607
Where should the line be drawn?

00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:38.207
Whatever your opinion on the rights and wrongs of the methods of Mazher Mahmood, his

00:21:38.207 --> 00:21:44.827
legacy is undeniable, and he most certainly deserves his nickname as The King of The Sting.

00:21:47.207 --> 00:21:52.797
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Rise And Fall of “The Fake Sheikh”.

00:21:53.127 --> 00:21:56.407
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:57.497 --> 00:22:01.027
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:01.407 --> 00:22:04.397
Do you think that celebrities and famous people deserve

00:22:04.417 --> 00:22:07.367
the same right to privacy as normal members of society?

00:22:08.037 --> 00:22:12.947
Do you think that sometimes these kinds of undercover methods are justified?

00:22:13.557 --> 00:22:15.707
Had you heard of this “Fake Sheikh” before?

00:22:16.477 --> 00:22:19.637
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

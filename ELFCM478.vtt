Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.490
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.670
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.549
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the UK General Election.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.200
On May 22nd, Rishi Sunak surprised the nation by

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.479
announcing that there will be a general election in the UK.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:41.540
It will take place on July the 4th, and by the end of the day the people of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.030
the United Kingdom may know that they will have a different Prime Minister.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.400
So, in this episode we are going to talk about why there is an election earlier than expected,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.210
what some of the key themes of the election may be, how the British political system works, what

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.630
political pundits and polls are saying, and who the next British Prime Minister is likely to be.

00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:12.384
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about the next general election.

00:01:14.644 --> 00:01:19.704
There is a great British tradition of standing outside in the rain without

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:24.934
an umbrella or a raincoat, and trying to pretend that everything is ok.

00:01:25.904 --> 00:01:29.674
And that was exactly what the British Prime Minister, Rishi

00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:34.344
Sunak, did on the afternoon of Wednesday the 22nd of May.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:41.584
He stood outside 10 Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister, and announced to a group

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:47.954
of journalists that the next general election would be held in just over a month’s time.

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:55.066
The rain poured down, his hair and jacket growing wetter by the minute.

00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:59.974
Sunak didn’t mention the rain, he carried on as if

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:03.404
everything was normal, in the great British tradition.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.904
But everything was not ok.

00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:12.454
The weather was not ok, that much was clear, but Sunak’s popularity,

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:18.024
and that of his political party, the Conservatives, was at rock bottom.

00:02:18.664 --> 00:02:25.084
He was not a popular man, and it was surprising to onlookers that he had decided that

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:31.034
then was the time to pull the trigger and call an earlier-than-expected election.

00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:36.684
Now, let me give you a brief reminder about the state of British

00:02:36.684 --> 00:02:40.864
politics before we move on to the question of the election itself.

00:02:42.084 --> 00:02:50.504
The UK has been governed by the same political party, the Conservatives, since 2010, for 14 years.

00:02:51.864 --> 00:02:56.424
During that time, the Conservatives have gone through 4 different

00:02:56.434 --> 00:03:01.554
leaders; David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, and Liz Truss.

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.144
Rishi Sunak is the fifth.

00:03:05.224 --> 00:03:11.474
His predecessor, Liz Truss, lasted for a mere 44 days, and Sunak has

00:03:11.474 --> 00:03:16.684
done slightly better, having led the country since October of 2022.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:23.344
If you are a seasoned listener to this show with an exceptional memory, you will remember

00:03:23.344 --> 00:03:30.164
that we ended episode number 327, on the ill-fated 44-days of Liz Truss, like this:

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:38.132
Sunak has until January of 2025 to call a general election, he has two years to rebuild trust

00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:43.412
and patch up the damage from the most chaotic period of recent British political history.

00:03:44.432 --> 00:03:49.162
It’s a monumental task that he has ahead of him, and all that remains to be

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:54.542
said is let’s check in again in a couple of years and see whether he manages it.

00:03:56.042 --> 00:03:58.657
It's kind of weird hearing your voice from a few years

00:03:58.657 --> 00:04:03.134
ago, but that was from an episode in December of 2022.

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:11.777
Anyway, here we are, I’m recording this at the end of May in 2024, and we have an election

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:17.507
coming up, a time for the British public to have its say on whether Rishi Sunak has

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:23.507
managed to turn the ship around, and be able to secure victory for the Conservatives.

00:04:24.387 --> 00:04:31.117
Almost all of the surveys, polls, and political pundits are in agreement about this: no.

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:35.917
Or rather, it seems incredibly unlikely that the Conservatives will win,

00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:41.293
and it would be the most monumental upset  if they did manage to win.

00:04:42.673 --> 00:04:48.245
Rishi Sunak has seen his popularity drop further and further as time has passed.

00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:53.835
There is nothing particularly unusual about that–it happens to most

00:04:53.855 --> 00:04:58.665
British Prime Ministers–but the extent of his unpopularity is unusual.

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:05.635
In April of this year, one polling company revealed that its most recent poll made

00:05:05.635 --> 00:05:12.695
Sunak the least popular British Prime Minister in history, with only 16% of the

00:05:12.695 --> 00:05:18.585
population approving of the job that he was doing, and only 19% of the country

00:05:18.915 --> 00:05:23.055
saying that it was planning to vote for The Conservatives, Sunak’s political party.

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:29.445
From his perceived weakness as a politician through to a mismanaged economy, there are

00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:34.685
numerous reasons that he has found himself more unpopular than any prime minister before.

00:05:35.715 --> 00:05:42.125
So, if he was and still is so unpopular, why did he call an election?

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:49.745
The last election was in December of 2019, so theoretically he had until January

00:05:49.765 --> 00:05:56.325
of 2025, another 6 months, to call another election, as the terms are for 5 years.

00:05:57.725 --> 00:06:03.315
Most political commentators believed that he would call an election sometime in the autumn,

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:09.305
after there was the chance for some more positive news about the economy, but he didn’t wait.

00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:15.775
So, why did he call an election now instead of in a few months time?

00:06:17.038 --> 00:06:20.968
According to political commentators, there are a few reasons.

00:06:21.768 --> 00:06:28.178
Firstly, he recently announced lower inflation and lower migration numbers, and he can

00:06:28.178 --> 00:06:32.518
tell people that his government is now steering the country in the right direction.

00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:39.868
Secondly, there might be progress before July in terms of sending asylum seekers

00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:44.258
to Rwanda, which will be popular with a particular set of British voters.

00:06:45.268 --> 00:06:49.258
And if he waits until the end of the year and there still hasn’t been any

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:54.058
progress on that front, it will underline his inability to get anything done.

00:06:55.268 --> 00:06:58.168
And thirdly there is the fact that he doesn’t want

00:06:58.178 --> 00:07:01.438
to be seen to have waited until the very last minute.

00:07:02.558 --> 00:07:07.288
As you may know, Rishi Sunak was not elected by the British public; he was

00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:11.678
elected by the members of the Conservative party after Liz Truss resigned.

00:07:12.368 --> 00:07:15.718
That’s just what happens when a Prime Minister resigns - there isn’t another

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:20.778
general election, rather the new Prime Minister is the head of the governing party.

00:07:21.688 --> 00:07:26.348
So, according to one theory, he thinks that if he calls an election

00:07:26.348 --> 00:07:30.498
“early” he can more genuinely claim that he is giving the British

00:07:30.568 --> 00:07:34.868
public the chance to have its say about who it wants as its leader.

00:07:35.728 --> 00:07:42.438
These theories could all be true, to a certain extent, if you believe that he believes that

00:07:42.438 --> 00:07:47.365
calling the election now is about increasing the probability of the Conservatives winning it.

00:07:48.338 --> 00:07:54.558
There is another category of theories which is that he has called the election this early so that he

00:07:54.558 --> 00:08:01.568
can lose the election with as little damage as possible, both to himself and the Conservative party.

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:06.558
Firstly, there is the question of damage to Sunak himself.

00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:13.398
If he feels like he will lose the election by a lower margin in July than he would in December,

00:08:13.848 --> 00:08:20.048
well this helps his future career prospects, it helps him in his life after being Prime Minister.

00:08:21.008 --> 00:08:25.548
Now, he isn’t going to be strapped for cash, in need of money, as between

00:08:25.548 --> 00:08:30.908
himself and his wife he has a fortune of almost a billion Euros, but it is

00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:36.328
more a case of damage limitation, and allowing him to move on and get on with

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:40.638
whatever his future plans might be without too much personal embarrassment.

00:08:42.128 --> 00:08:48.328
And talking about damage limitation to the Conservative party, there is also the theory that

00:08:48.328 --> 00:08:53.188
he has been pushed into calling an early election by members of his own political party.

00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:59.028
These are men and women who know that Sunak is very likely to lose the

00:08:59.028 --> 00:09:04.158
election, but believe that the longer he delays it, the fewer votes

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:08.518
the Conservatives will receive, and the fewer MPs will be elected.

00:09:09.738 --> 00:09:14.418
In both cases, whether he truly believes that he can win the election or whether

00:09:14.418 --> 00:09:19.528
he only wants to lose it as quickly and painlessly as possible, clearly he feels

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:24.758
like this is more likely to happen in July rather than in December or January.

00:09:25.858 --> 00:09:31.758
Now, this is probably a good point to talk about the practicalities of the UK

00:09:31.798 --> 00:09:36.698
electoral system, because it probably is different to the one in your country.

00:09:37.378 --> 00:09:41.948
The UK operates a system called “first past the post”.

00:09:42.918 --> 00:09:50.408
How this works is that the country is divided into what are called constituencies, 650 in total.

00:09:51.618 --> 00:09:56.048
Anyone can put themselves forward to be the elected official in a constituency.

00:09:56.678 --> 00:10:02.438
You can be an independent candidate, but most candidates are aligned to a political party.

00:10:03.548 --> 00:10:08.018
Then, every eligible adult votes for the person they

00:10:08.018 --> 00:10:12.148
want in their constituency, in their geographical area.

00:10:12.738 --> 00:10:16.978
The person who gets the most votes becomes the elected official

00:10:16.988 --> 00:10:21.978
for that area, the member of parliament, or “MP” for short.

00:10:22.738 --> 00:10:28.768
The person who comes second gets nothing, so let’s say one candidate gets

00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:37.108
50,000 votes and another candidate gets 50,001, the second candidate is elected

00:10:37.348 --> 00:10:42.858
and becomes an MP, and the first gets nothing, they go home empty handed.

00:10:43.828 --> 00:10:50.138
All 650 areas do this, and then the winning candidates become MPs.

00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:55.258
Now, almost all of these MPs are part of a political

00:10:55.268 --> 00:11:00.648
party, so the party with the most MPs forms a government.

00:11:01.698 --> 00:11:07.058
The most popular political party doesn’t always have a majority, it doesn't always have

00:11:07.228 --> 00:11:14.338
more than half of the MPs, so they have to form a coalition, but this first past the

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:22.008
post system favours larger parties, so having coalition governments is less common than

00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:27.248
it is in countries with different voting systems, like Germany or Italy, for example.

00:11:28.838 --> 00:11:36.038
To reiterate how this is different from a proportional voting system, in a proportional voting

00:11:36.038 --> 00:11:44.998
system, if a party gets, let’s say, 30% of the vote, they will have 30% of the representatives.

00:11:45.928 --> 00:11:51.978
In a first-past-the-post system, like in the United Kingdom, it is possible for a party

00:11:51.978 --> 00:12:00.098
that receives 30% of the vote to end up with 0% or even 100% of the representatives.

00:12:01.548 --> 00:12:07.478
Right, that’s the administrative bit out of the way, the bit about how the political system works.

00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:10.988
Who are the other candidates then, who is going to

00:12:10.988 --> 00:12:13.798
be the next British Prime Minister if it isn’t Rishi.

00:12:15.308 --> 00:12:19.038
Well, there is really only one viable alternative.

00:12:19.658 --> 00:12:24.898
There are two dominant political parties in British politics: The Conservatives, which

00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:30.618
is traditionally right of centre, and Labour, which is traditionally left of centre.

00:12:31.648 --> 00:12:34.238
You might have heard of the Liberal Democrats, the

00:12:34.248 --> 00:12:37.918
Scottish National Party, the Green party, or even UKIP.

00:12:38.418 --> 00:12:45.268
But these parties typically never get more than 20% of the MPs between them, so

00:12:45.718 --> 00:12:50.418
really it's a question of whether it will be a Labour or Conservative Party victory.

00:12:51.428 --> 00:12:58.088
And the leader of the Labour Party, the leader of the opposition, is a man called Keir Starmer.

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:06.314
He has been the leader since 2020, and his strategy ever since he was elected can probably

00:13:06.314 --> 00:13:12.004
be best described as “sit in the sidelines and let the Conservatives make the mistakes”.

00:13:13.344 --> 00:13:17.484
Throughout his time as the leader of the opposition he has been relatively

00:13:17.634 --> 00:13:22.924
coy, quite quiet, about what his policies would be were he Prime Minister.

00:13:23.864 --> 00:13:27.294
Instead, he has been very good at pointing out the mistakes

00:13:27.314 --> 00:13:30.574
of the Conservative government, and holding them to account.

00:13:31.994 --> 00:13:36.474
His critics say that he hasn’t offered solutions, and it isn’t really

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:41.854
clear what he stands for, but he has played a very canny political game

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:46.724
by being relatively quiet and letting his opponents make the mistakes.

00:13:47.884 --> 00:13:49.554
And he hasn’t had to wait long.

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:56.404
Since only 2020, when he took over from Jeremy Corbyn, the Conservatives have had

00:13:56.494 --> 00:14:01.674
three leaders, they have grossly mishandled the pandemic, there has been serious

00:14:01.714 --> 00:14:06.134
economic mismanagement, and there have been numerous public embarrassments.

00:14:07.634 --> 00:14:13.244
And on a deeper and more important level, since the Conservatives first

00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:18.974
took office in 2010, the UK has not grown and prospered economically in

00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:22.654
a way that every single Conservative Prime Minister has said it would.

00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:30.724
According to one report from last year, the average worker in the UK is £11,000 a year worse

00:14:30.764 --> 00:14:37.904
off than they were before the Conservatives, so that’s almost €15,000 a year worse off.

00:14:38.944 --> 00:14:44.844
Wages have increased in nominal terms, but these increases have been

00:14:44.944 --> 00:14:48.914
eaten away by inflation, meaning that the average British worker

00:14:49.334 --> 00:14:53.104
hasn't had a real pay rise since the Conservatives took power.

00:14:54.598 --> 00:14:58.648
Of course, inflation is a subject that has affected countries all over the

00:14:58.648 --> 00:15:03.843
world, and the Conservatives repeatedly remind people of this, pointing out that

00:15:03.848 --> 00:15:08.368
the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID pandemic were the chief causes.

00:15:09.078 --> 00:15:15.998
But a stumbling economy and low wage growth were both things that Brits felt before either of these.

00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:23.748
This, combined with increasing waiting times at the NHS–the national healthcare system–increasing

00:15:23.748 --> 00:15:30.768
cuts to social services, and the sad reality that 4 million British children live in poverty,

00:15:31.248 --> 00:15:38.588
this is all ammunition that Keir Starmer has and undoubtedly will continue to use in his campaign.

00:15:39.428 --> 00:15:42.918
The country has had enough, it is time for “change”.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:49.508
And indeed, when Keir Starmer gave his first speech after the announcement of the election,

00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:56.978
he stood in front of a podium with one word plastered in big capital letters: Change.

00:15:57.795 --> 00:16:03.578
Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives continue to tell us that things are getting better, that you

00:16:03.578 --> 00:16:09.468
just need to trust us to turn the economy around, but they have been saying this for 14 years.

00:16:10.128 --> 00:16:13.098
Enough is enough, so the theory goes.

00:16:13.348 --> 00:16:19.898
People are ready for a change, and although Keir Starmer might not have the X factor in terms

00:16:19.898 --> 00:16:26.126
of charisma or making grand speeches, the British people have had enough of the Conservatives.

00:16:26.948 --> 00:16:30.158
That is certainly what Keir Starmer is hoping for at least.

00:16:31.538 --> 00:16:37.038
The Conservatives’ key message in the campaign will be about trust, that Labour

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:42.698
cannot be trusted with the keys to the British economy, that Labour has no plan.

00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:48.538
A phrase that Rishi Sunak has already been repeating again and again

00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:53.624
is “going back to square one”, meaning going back right to the start.

00:16:54.408 --> 00:16:59.998
Rishi and the Conservatives have a plan, he says, it is starting to work, as people

00:16:59.998 --> 00:17:05.848
can see by inflation coming down and the situation starting to look slightly less grim.

00:17:06.628 --> 00:17:11.748
A vote for Labour is a vote to rip up the Conservatives’ plan, to return to

00:17:11.748 --> 00:17:17.438
square one, and what’s more, square one without a plan about how to move forward.

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:23.988
Now, I told you at the start of the episode that Rishi Sunak made the announcement of

00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:29.518
the general election standing in the pouring rain, and it was all a bit embarrassing.

00:17:30.778 --> 00:17:32.618
That wasn’t the only embarrassment.

00:17:33.498 --> 00:17:37.568
A group of mischievous Labour supporters had found out about the announcement

00:17:37.588 --> 00:17:42.668
beforehand, and had congregated outside the gates to Downing Street.

00:17:44.078 --> 00:17:49.448
They brought a loudspeaker with them, and were playing the song “Things can only get

00:17:49.458 --> 00:17:55.878
better”, which was used by the Labour leader Tony Blair when he won the election in 1997.

00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:17.659
To his credit, Rishi Sunak managed to not be too put off, but he was almost

00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:22.319
drowned out by the noise of the song, you could barely hear him over the noise.

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:29.229
It was not an auspicious start to the campaign, but the song was a fitting message.

00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:32.189
Things can only get better.

00:18:33.419 --> 00:18:39.099
One imagines that Rishi might have thought that it’s not as if they could get much worse.

00:18:41.359 --> 00:18:46.079
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the UK general election.

00:18:46.459 --> 00:18:49.149
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that this has given you

00:18:49.159 --> 00:18:53.479
some background on how things might develop over the next few weeks.

00:18:54.329 --> 00:18:58.959
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:04.869
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

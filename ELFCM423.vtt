Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.119
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.369
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.800
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Rothschilds.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.299
It’s the story of how one family went from a cramped bedroom in a Jewish ghetto in

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.080
Frankfurt to being one of the most powerful, and certainly the richest, families in Europe.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.170
It’s a story of perseverance, finance, cunning, war, anti-Semitism, the power

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.099
of information, secrecy and how to accumulate a simply vast amount of money.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.930
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.080
In 1846, a pamphlet was published in France.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.770
It was signed only “Satan”, the name of its true author not revealed.

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.770
And it made a bold claim about an event that had

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.080
happened 31 years beforehand, at the Battle of Waterloo.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.010
According to this pamphlet, a man called Nathan Rothschild was at The Battle of Waterloo.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.179
He was not a soldier, he wasn’t wielding a sword or gun or even commanding a regiment.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.240
Nathan Rothschild was a banker, the owner of the London branch of a large banking

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.960
house called Rothschild, and the head of a pan-European banking conglomerate.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.420
Rothschild, according to the pamphlet, was waiting eagerly to see which direction the battle went.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.510
Would Napoleon’s French army emerge victorious?

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.160
Or would the British-led coalition defeat the French?

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.970
Rothschild wasn’t there merely out of curiosity, as a spectator.

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.180
The result of the battle would have a large knock-on effect

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.950
on the future of France, Britain, and even Europe more widely.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.189
And it would also have a large effect on the price

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.809
of British government bonds, British national debt.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.660
As you will know, wars are expensive, and the British government

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.070
borrowed heavily to finance this extensive military campaign.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.179
If Napoleon won the battle, the price of British government debt would drop, as

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.450
investors would become worried about the British government’s continued ability

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.059
to repay its obligations, to continue to pay the people who had lent it money.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.209
But if Napoleon lost, the opposite would happen.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.360
This debt would be considered less risky, investors would want to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.890
buy more of it, and the price of British government debt would rise.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.980
A lot was riding on the result.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.509
Nathan Rothschild, so the pamphlet alleged, was watching the battle so that he would

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:25.970
learn the result firsthand, rather than wait for it to be printed in the newspapers.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.410
As soon as it became clear that Napoleon had been defeated, Rothschild got on a fast

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.560
horse, rushed to the Belgian coast with the aim of boarding the first ship to England.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.590
But to his horror he found that there had been a terrible

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.260
storm and all ships had been ordered not to go out to sea.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.290
He asked around, looking for anyone who would be able to transport him across the sea to England.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.890
Money was no object, the banker added, no price was too high.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.630
Eventually he found a fisherman who was willing to do it.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.009
He paid him handsomely, and the pair set off across the stormy sea for the coast of England.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.880
Rothschild arrived in London before any news of the result of the battle had reached the city.

00:04:23.444 --> 00:04:27.764
The reason he was in such a hurry was not because he wanted to be the

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:31.614
first person to break the good news to the king or to the Prime Minister;

00:04:32.364 --> 00:04:37.494
it was because he sensed a once-in-a-lifetime money-making opportunity.

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:43.024
He went straight to the stock market, the pamphlet alleged, and

00:04:43.054 --> 00:04:47.264
bought up as much government debt as he could get his hands on.

00:04:48.674 --> 00:04:53.904
When the news of Napoleon's defeat finally reached the capital, a full 24

00:04:53.954 --> 00:05:00.104
hours after Rothschild had arrived, the price of British debt soared and

00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:06.374
Rothschild made 20 million francs, a gargantuan, vast amount of money.

00:05:07.544 --> 00:05:11.334
The story in the pamphlet went the 19th century equivalent of

00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:15.394
viral, and was translated into a bunch of different languages.

00:05:16.474 --> 00:05:20.714
And the legend of what happened even got adapted over the years.

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:26.794
In one version Rothschild actually started selling debt to make people think

00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:31.194
that Britain had lost, and because he was such a well-respected financier

00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:34.994
people saw what he was doing and thought “Rothschild must know something”,

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:39.644
so they started selling their debt too, and the price continued to fall.

00:05:40.094 --> 00:05:45.664
And at the last minute, just before the news of Napoleon's defeat broke, Rothschild

00:05:45.754 --> 00:05:51.584
swooped in and bought it all up, making himself an even bigger fortune in the process

00:05:52.994 --> 00:05:57.304
It is a great story, but the problem is that the story in the

00:05:57.304 --> 00:06:02.164
pamphlet simply isn’t true, at least in its original format.

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:08.804
Nathan Rothschild wasn’t at the Battle of Waterloo, he didn’t rush back to England, there’s

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:14.284
no evidence that he bought lots of debt, and by the time the pamphlet was published,

00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:20.794
Rothschild had died, so there was no possible way to conclusively refute the story.

00:06:21.944 --> 00:06:27.094
It turned out that the author of the pamphlet, so-called “Satan” was an

00:06:27.104 --> 00:06:32.314
anti-Semitic and anti-capitalist left wing journalist called Georges Dairnvall

00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:38.511
and the entire story had been invented to stir up discontent and increase

00:06:38.551 --> 00:06:43.841
animosity towards Jews, especially wealthy Jews such as Nathan Rothschild.

00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:51.386
Now, you may accuse me of doing the same thing by repeating the story here, but the

00:06:51.386 --> 00:06:56.596
reason to start with the story told in this pamphlet is because it touches on some of the

00:06:56.626 --> 00:07:03.546
key themes of the Rothschild family: the value of information, the link between war and

00:07:03.546 --> 00:07:10.376
money, the invention of government debt, and the prejudice that the family faced as Jews.

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:15.536
And to tell the story of the Rothschild family, we must

00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:19.846
in fact start in a Jewish ghetto, the ghetto of Frankfurt.

00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:28.756
It was here that the father of the Rothschild dynasty, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, was born in 1744.

00:07:30.306 --> 00:07:37.616
Mayer Rothschild was initially a coin dealer, buying and selling coins, but he got his big

00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:44.026
break managing the financial affairs of William IX of Hesse, who was a wealthy German ruler.

00:07:45.516 --> 00:07:49.896
As you may know, throughout much of European history, Jews

00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:54.166
faced multiple restrictions on what they could and couldn’t do.

00:07:55.286 --> 00:08:02.786
Now, this varied by country and by ruler, but Jews were often not allowed to own land or become

00:08:02.796 --> 00:08:09.216
tradespeople like carpenters or blacksmiths, or to hold public office or to practise medicine.

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:14.806
Jewish people weren’t allowed to do an awful lot, but the one

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:19.616
thing that they were allowed to do was to lend money with interest.

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:24.216
The Catholic Church forbade Christians from doing this,

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:28.316
saying that it was usury, and it wasn’t allowed by the Bible.

00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:33.836
But Jewish people were not bound by the same restrictions.

00:08:35.156 --> 00:08:40.196
As a result, with few other options to participate in medieval society and

00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:46.066
with a clear need that could be filled, many Jewish people found opportunity in

00:08:46.066 --> 00:08:50.726
the money lending industry, lending out money to people and charging interest.

00:08:52.276 --> 00:08:58.156
It turned out that the Jewish community was well-placed to do this; Jewish people

00:08:58.156 --> 00:09:03.456
were spread throughout Europe, there were high levels of trust and pre-existing trade

00:09:03.456 --> 00:09:09.236
links between Jews in different cities and countries, so there was a lot of existing

00:09:09.286 --> 00:09:13.596
infrastructure, we could say, that already existed within the Jewish community.

00:09:15.036 --> 00:09:19.656
And by the time of Mayer Rothschild in the 18th century, the

00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:23.746
finance industry was well-developed within the Jewish community.

00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:27.426
But this was a double-edged sword.

00:09:28.476 --> 00:09:33.536
On the one hand, Jews were providing a valuable service, lending money to

00:09:33.536 --> 00:09:37.716
people who needed it, and being paid interest or commissions in return.

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:44.516
As is still the case today, the finance industry can be lucrative, you can

00:09:44.516 --> 00:09:50.336
make a lot of money dealing with money, but on the flip side, this led to

00:09:50.346 --> 00:09:56.596
jealousy, suspicion and antisemitism, prejudice towards Jews who were perceived

00:09:56.596 --> 00:10:01.256
as having some kind of suspicious talent for making money and growing rich.

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:06.226
Now, that’s some very brief background, but that is

00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:09.076
the backdrop for everything that's about to happen.

00:10:10.606 --> 00:10:15.866
To bring it back to the Rothschilds, Mayer Rothschild, the head of the family,

00:10:16.296 --> 00:10:21.196
became the choice financier for this man called William IX, who had made his

00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:27.666
fortune essentially hiring out his citizens as mercenaries, as soldiers for hire.

00:10:29.206 --> 00:10:33.696
Rothschild managed his patron’s wealth, doing everything from making sure that

00:10:33.696 --> 00:10:38.116
Napoleon didn’t get his hands on it through to investing it and growing his fortune.

00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:47.366
Mayer Rothschild himself grew very wealthy, but this was only sowing the seeds for what was to come.

00:10:48.866 --> 00:10:52.806
Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s most important legacy, his most

00:10:52.816 --> 00:10:56.486
profitable investment you might even say, was his family.

00:10:57.986 --> 00:11:02.086
He had 11 children, six daughters and five sons.

00:11:03.376 --> 00:11:09.746
Unfortunately the daughters don’t have much of a role to play in this story, but the five sons do.

00:11:11.176 --> 00:11:15.556
Mayer Rothschild decided to go from private banker of a wealthy

00:11:15.556 --> 00:11:19.756
German to the head of what would become the most successful banking

00:11:19.756 --> 00:11:24.776
partnership in Europe, and to do this he needed the help of his children.

00:11:26.236 --> 00:11:30.306
He sent each of his five sons to a centre of European

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:34.646
finance, instructing them to go there and set up operations.

00:11:36.076 --> 00:11:39.626
The oldest, Amschel Mayer Rothschild, stayed in Frankfurt.

00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:42.976
The second, Salomon, went to Vienna.

00:11:43.676 --> 00:11:46.016
The third, Nathan, to England.

00:11:46.286 --> 00:11:48.206
The fourth, Carl, to Naples.

00:11:48.616 --> 00:11:51.306
And the fifth, James, went to Paris.

00:11:52.596 --> 00:11:56.246
There, they were instructed to set up business under

00:11:56.246 --> 00:11:59.296
the Rothschild name, Rothschild banks, essentially.

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:05.696
Each bank would offer financial services to the people and rulers of the kingdom.

00:12:07.286 --> 00:12:10.576
But, of course, we aren’t talking about a baker or a

00:12:10.586 --> 00:12:13.906
blacksmith keeping a few hundred Francs with the Rothschilds.

00:12:14.156 --> 00:12:17.826
We are talking about high finance, raising capital for

00:12:17.826 --> 00:12:21.896
companies, and most importantly, raising money for countries.

00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:28.266
This all happened at the start of the 19th century, in the middle of the Napoleonic Wars.

00:12:29.146 --> 00:12:34.956
Wars are expensive, soldiers need to be paid, guns and ammunition bought.

00:12:35.986 --> 00:12:40.366
Historically, wars were typically paid for by raising taxes or

00:12:40.566 --> 00:12:43.886
simply forcing peasants to become soldiers and join the army.

00:12:44.846 --> 00:12:50.086
Clearly, both of those options are unpopular, as nobody likes taxes

00:12:50.086 --> 00:12:53.276
going up or being forced to risk their life on the battlefield.

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:57.786
Another option was selling off pieces of land, but

00:12:58.086 --> 00:13:01.026
that wasn’t something a ruler typically wanted to do.

00:13:02.216 --> 00:13:07.046
But, when it came to the 19th century and with the pan-European banking

00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:11.586
network that the Rothschild sons had built up, there was an alternative.

00:13:12.776 --> 00:13:18.406
The Rothschilds, with their base in five different European countries and their extensive

00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:24.146
network of wealthy individuals, could offer governments loans, essentially, to fight wars.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.580
A government could go to one of the Rothschild brothers and say, hey,

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.280
we need a load of money to fight this war, can you get it for us?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.770
And the Rothschilds would say, “sure”, they would go to wealthy individuals all

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:44.100
over Europe and say “we have this great investment opportunity”, and investors

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:49.040
would loan the government money, all enabled through the Rothschild banking network.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.420
The government would pay interest, the investors would be happy,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.580
and the Rothschilds would make a fee for facilitating the service.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:05.170
What’s more, the Rothschilds allowed investors to buy and sell their debt through their banks,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.630
making it a much more attractive investment because it was more easily tradable than ever before.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.970
And it was considered relatively low risk, because you were dealing with the government after all.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:23.150
It might sound like a basic thing to say, given that the global bond market is now

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:29.060
worth literally hundreds of trillions of dollars, but it’s hard to overstate how

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.690
important this innovation was, not just for governments but for the economy overall.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.660
Before this, there were very limited opportunities for

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.550
people with money to invest it and make more money.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:48.030
There was, in some countries, some form of stock market, but these were

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:54.050
characterised by booms and busts, and the idea of a publicly-listed company,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:59.520
an Amazon or Apple, that people could invest in, this was undeveloped.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.500
For most wealthy people, most potential investors, the only place to

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:11.410
invest money was in land, and that had limited opportunity for a return.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:19.310
Through government bonds, investors could invest in the government, essentially, guaranteeing

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:24.250
themselves a secure annual return, so long as the government didn’t go bust that was.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:32.070
And this brings us on to another very important element of the Rothschilds’ success: information.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:38.410
You heard in the story at the start of the episode about the allegation that Nathan

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.050
had profited from learning the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo before anyone else.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:49.630
That is now believed to be completely false, but what is certainly true is that

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.840
the Rothchild family had an extensive information network, with their own system

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:00.870
of couriers, and even allegedly a system of homing pigeons, which ensured that it

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.720
was always up to date with anything that might affect the price of its investments.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:11.772
If there was a result of a battle or a death of a monarch, or an invasion of a new

00:16:11.772 --> 00:16:17.432
territory, anything that might affect the creditworthiness of a government’s debt, and

00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:22.902
therefore its price, the Rothschilds had a sophisticated network that meant that it would

00:16:22.902 --> 00:16:28.592
know about it before anyone else, so that it could either make money or avoid losing money.

00:16:29.872 --> 00:16:35.792
What’s more, the Rothschild banking network became a hugely valuable partner to European

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:41.542
governments, especially the British government, because of its ability to transfer money.

00:16:43.222 --> 00:16:47.642
In the modern era of being able to pick up your smartphone and send money

00:16:47.682 --> 00:16:52.582
anywhere in the world, it’s perhaps hard to imagine quite how important this was,

00:16:53.192 --> 00:16:57.742
but imagine you were the British government at the start of the 19th century.

00:16:58.502 --> 00:17:02.782
You have tens of thousands of soldiers fighting in France and Spain.

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:05.202
They need to be paid.

00:17:06.132 --> 00:17:06.882
How do you do it?

00:17:07.572 --> 00:17:10.862
How does the money go from the British government in

00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:14.602
London through to a soldier in some field in Spain?

00:17:16.042 --> 00:17:18.112
This is where the Rothschilds came in.

00:17:19.032 --> 00:17:23.902
With their extensive network of banks in five different countries, and their

00:17:23.952 --> 00:17:28.982
access to different currencies as well as gold, they could facilitate all of this.

00:17:30.112 --> 00:17:34.692
The British government might pay the London branch of Rothschild in British

00:17:34.702 --> 00:17:40.062
pounds, the London branch would then arrange for this to be exchanged to gold

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:45.462
bullion, transported via ship to Spain, exchanged with a local partner into

00:17:45.462 --> 00:17:49.092
currency that the soldiers could use, so that the soldiers could be paid.

00:17:50.352 --> 00:17:57.042
Now, you might have noticed that I said “might pay”, not “paid”, as how the

00:17:57.052 --> 00:18:02.952
Rothschilds managed to do this is still a little bit of a mystery, it’s a closed book.

00:18:04.112 --> 00:18:09.512
Even the biographers and historians of the Rothschild family don’t have access

00:18:09.512 --> 00:18:15.212
to the details of exactly how the family did it, but they soon became the go-to

00:18:15.232 --> 00:18:20.452
financial partner for European powers needing to move large amounts of money around.

00:18:22.042 --> 00:18:27.392
Now, as to exactly how much money the family made, which members of the family

00:18:27.392 --> 00:18:34.082
made it, and when this was made, this is also not public information, and is

00:18:34.082 --> 00:18:38.732
a subject of disagreement even with Rothschild biographers and historians.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:45.132
While Nathan, the head of the London branch, is probably the most famous of the

00:18:45.132 --> 00:18:50.712
brothers and the one that many people would say was the most savvy, and brought the

00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:56.252
most profits to the family, a critically acclaimed relatively recent biography by

00:18:56.252 --> 00:19:01.502
the Scottish historian Niall Ferguson claims that, although Nathan was the undisputed

00:19:01.532 --> 00:19:07.582
leader of the brothers and it was his London branch that had the first big success, the

00:19:07.582 --> 00:19:13.012
fortune was created more equally, with all five of the brothers pulling their weight.

00:19:14.462 --> 00:19:17.372
In any case, the fortune was vast.

00:19:18.872 --> 00:19:25.282
According to Ferguson’s biography, “When Nathan died in 1836, his personal

00:19:25.282 --> 00:19:30.592
fortune was equivalent to 0.62 per cent of British national income.”

00:19:31.972 --> 00:19:36.242
In other words, one individual, who had come to Britain in his twenties,

00:19:36.632 --> 00:19:42.432
had accumulated a fortune of nearly 1% of the total income in the country.

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:49.652
If someone was to have a similar fortune today, it would be something like 20 billion Euro.

00:19:51.122 --> 00:19:58.082
And, as you might imagine, the family bought up and built huge mansions and palaces all over Europe.

00:19:59.092 --> 00:20:03.162
By the end of the 19th century, this luxury property portfolio

00:20:03.162 --> 00:20:07.522
of the family consisted of almost 50 palaces across Europe'.

00:20:08.602 --> 00:20:14.992
It is quite astounding, and what is perhaps even more astounding is that the Rothschild

00:20:14.992 --> 00:20:21.562
family has not only managed to not lose this vast fortune, but, with some exceptions,

00:20:21.982 --> 00:20:27.492
subsequent generations of Rothschilds have shown a remarkable talent for growing it.

00:20:28.752 --> 00:20:32.602
Of course, given that the family started in the late 18th century with

00:20:32.602 --> 00:20:37.772
five brothers, and is now going on 10 generations, the Rothschild dynasty

00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:42.652
is vast, linked through marriage with European royalty, spread out through

00:20:42.652 --> 00:20:46.922
Europe and involved in all manner of different businesses and industries.

00:20:47.782 --> 00:20:52.072
But it is still remarkably tight, facilitated by a lot

00:20:52.072 --> 00:20:55.322
of intermarriage, so things are kept “in the family”.

00:20:56.772 --> 00:21:01.542
The bread and butter of the Rothschilds is still in the world of high finance,

00:21:01.762 --> 00:21:05.882
both offering financial services and managing the vast Rothschild fortune.

00:21:07.172 --> 00:21:12.672
But the Rothschilds have spread out beyond the world of finance, they are also involved in

00:21:12.672 --> 00:21:19.182
property, oil and gas, luxury yachts, and if you are a wine lover you will no doubt have heard

00:21:19.212 --> 00:21:24.662
of the famous and very expensive Château Lafite Rothschild and Château Mouton Rothschild.

00:21:25.732 --> 00:21:31.742
The point is, the influence of the Rothschild family is vast, and this, combined

00:21:31.742 --> 00:21:35.342
with the underlying antisemitism that the family has dealt with its entire

00:21:35.382 --> 00:21:40.062
life, this has led it to being the subject of all sorts of conspiracy theories.

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:44.892
These range from the Rothschilds artificially creating wars in the 19th

00:21:44.892 --> 00:21:49.802
century to profit from them through to the family controlling the weather, so

00:21:49.802 --> 00:21:53.662
that they can make money from knowing whether it will rain or shine tomorrow.

00:21:54.442 --> 00:21:58.652
There are images shared on social media claiming that the Rothschild family

00:21:58.912 --> 00:22:03.392
owns some ridiculous amount of the world’s wealth, I found one claiming

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:08.108
that it is 80% of all money in the world that is owned by the Rothschilds.

00:22:09.032 --> 00:22:14.012
It is certainly an alluring theory, that there is some incredibly secretive rich

00:22:14.022 --> 00:22:18.862
family somewhere that controls the flow of money, that is pulling the strings of every

00:22:18.862 --> 00:22:24.132
politician and can make or break the fortunes of a country with the click of its fingers.

00:22:25.207 --> 00:22:31.540
But, much like the pamphlet alleging Nathan Rothschild was at Waterloo, it is simply not true.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.890
Estimates of the Rothschild family wealth vary, but they typically have it

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.950
at somewhere in the tens of billions through to the hundreds of billions.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.690
So, to wrap things up, the Rothschild story is a tale of family

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.800
unity, financial acumen, and adaptation through the centuries.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.660
It's a story that has intermingled with European history, politics, and

00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:01.000
business in myriad ways, leaving an indelible mark on the continent and beyond.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.890
And to think, it all started with five brothers in a tiny cramped bedroom in a Frankfurt ghetto.

00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:14.793
OK then, that is it for today's little exploration of The Rothschilds.

00:23:15.113 --> 00:23:19.173
There is so much more to say on this, tens of thousands of pages have

00:23:19.173 --> 00:23:22.793
been written on the subject, so I think this is certainly a topic to

00:23:22.793 --> 00:23:26.633
revisit and dive into in slightly more detail in a future episode.

00:23:27.493 --> 00:23:30.363
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:30.983 --> 00:23:32.553
Have you heard of the Rothschilds before?

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:35.573
What does the name “Rothschild” mean in your country?

00:23:36.253 --> 00:23:39.333
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

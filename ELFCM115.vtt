Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:16.142
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:20.792
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:27.522
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Great Fire of

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:34.685
London, when a huge fire swept through the centre of London, destroying 13 thousand

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:41.779
houses, making 100,000 people homeless, and changing the face of the city forever.

00:00:42.585 --> 00:00:46.805
It’s an amazing story, and one that is not very well known

00:00:46.845 --> 00:00:51.785
outside the UK, so I’m super excited to share it with you today.

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:59.225
OK then, let’s not waste one minute, and get straight into the story of the Great Fire of London.

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:08.035
In the early hours of the 2nd of September 1666, above a bakery on Pudding

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:14.055
Lane, in the City of London, a baker, Thomas Farriner, was sleeping soundly.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:20.485
He woke up to find smoke coming through the door, and managed to escape

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:25.045
out of the window onto a neighbouring roof, with his daughter Hannah.

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:31.315
His maid, his servant, was too afraid to jump out of the window with them,

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:36.285
and she perished in the fire, she was caught up by the flames, and died.

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:43.955
And this was to be how the Great Fire of London, the most famous fire in British history, started.

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:48.615
Fires in London were relatively common at the time.

00:01:48.915 --> 00:01:55.385
Fire was used for all sorts of purposes, from lighting to heating to cooking, and it

00:01:55.385 --> 00:02:01.665
was common for fires to be left alight in the house during the evening, to heat it.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:09.055
Whatsmore, the streets in London were very narrow, most buildings were made from wood,

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:15.535
and people would often keep flammable material in their homes, things like hay and oil.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:18.525
Things that would set on fire easily.

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:25.325
London was a living, breathing, industrialising city, very different

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:30.305
to the London of today, so people had all of this highly flammable,

00:02:30.495 --> 00:02:35.685
industrial material right in the city centre, right in the heart of London.

00:02:36.905 --> 00:02:43.795
If you’re wondering exactly where Pudding Lane is, where the fire started, it is right

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:49.625
in the centre of the City of London, just a stone’s throw away from London Bridge.

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:58.715
The area is now very fancy, and the City is a centre of finance, it's the Wall Street of

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:06.675
London, but back in 1666 it was very different, it was crowded, it was not fancy at all.

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:12.165
So, fires were a relatively frequent occurrence, they happened

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:15.615
quite a lot and they were nothing to be hugely concerned about.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:22.825
Indeed, The Lord Mayor of London, a man called Thomas Bludworth, went to look at

00:03:22.825 --> 00:03:28.545
the fire above the bakery in Pudding Lane at 3 o’ clock that morning, a couple of

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:35.015
hours after it started, and he didn’t consider it to be anything out of the ordinary.

00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:43.345
But in 1666 there had been a particularly dry summer, there was a drought in London,

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:49.305
so there wasn’t much water available to put out fires, and there was a strong wind.

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:55.505
These factors caused this fire to be anything but ordinary.

00:03:56.885 --> 00:04:03.255
Over the next 4 days it spread and spread, engulfing large parts of the city,

00:04:03.705 --> 00:04:12.165
destroying 13,200 houses and 89 churches, including the iconic St Paul’s cathedral.

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:16.560
After the Lord Mayor returned to the scene of the fire the

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:20.665
following morning, it was clear that he had been wrong.

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:23.885
It was definitely something to be worried about.

00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:29.495
The fire was spreading quickly and the sky was turning black.

00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:36.205
But back in 1666 there was no official fire brigade, no

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:40.525
government authority was responsible for putting out the fire.

00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:48.655
And techniques for actually putting out fires were pretty primitive, they were quite basic.

00:04:49.605 --> 00:04:55.075
There were quite simple water pumps and buckets, which were fine for smaller fires,

00:04:55.105 --> 00:05:00.345
but aren’t very effective when entire streets, and entire buildings, are burning.

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:05.395
The Lord Mayor instructed for buildings to be pulled down,

00:05:05.435 --> 00:05:09.575
to be destroyed, so that the fire wouldn’t be able to spread.

00:05:10.775 --> 00:05:16.195
Men were instructed to go to where the fire hadn’t yet reached and pull down

00:05:16.195 --> 00:05:21.605
houses, so that when the fire did get to the house before, it wouldn’t be able to

00:05:21.605 --> 00:05:29.275
pass to the next, in effect creating a void, a barrier, a gap to stop the flames.

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:36.545
Even though these houses weren’t very structurally sound, they weren’t very robust,

00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:42.875
pulling down a house with hooks and ropes isn’t easy, and it took a long time.

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:50.545
By the evening of Tuesday the 4th of September, a full 72 hours after

00:05:50.545 --> 00:05:55.945
the fire had started, flames had engulfed large parts of the city.

00:05:57.175 --> 00:06:04.085
Pulling down houses worked as a principle, creating these empty spaces did stop the fire,

00:06:04.485 --> 00:06:11.695
but actually pulling them down took too long, and the fire was still spreading too quickly.

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:18.515
So they started using gunpowder, explosives to blow up houses,

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:24.185
destroying them and creating voids, creating gaps, to stop the fire.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:29.355
By this time hundreds of thousands of people had fled

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:33.085
the city, abandoned their homes to escape the blaze.

00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:41.375
The population of London at the time of the fire was around 350,000 - it was one of the

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:48.765
largest cities in Europe - and 100,000 people were left homeless by the end of the fire.

00:06:49.635 --> 00:06:54.605
Rich and poor, they both lived in this area of London, and there are

00:06:54.605 --> 00:06:59.445
reports of wealthy Londoners fleeing with all of their possessions,

00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:04.715
packing up their entire large houses and trying to escape the flames.

00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:07.055
Not everyone fled though.

00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:12.515
A man called Samuel Pepys, who was an advisor to the king, King

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:18.755
Charles II, stayed to observe the fire, and it is actually through his

00:07:18.785 --> 00:07:23.195
diary entries that we get a lot of our knowledge about what happened.

00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:27.705
Pepys didn’t want to move everything out of his house,

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:31.635
but he did want to protect his most valuable possessions.

00:07:32.535 --> 00:07:39.405
To Pepys, two of his most valuable items were a bottle of wine and his parmesan

00:07:39.415 --> 00:07:45.015
cheese, which he decided to bury in his garden, to protect it from the fire.

00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:50.895
Luckily for Pepys his house wasn’t burned down, so he was able to

00:07:50.895 --> 00:07:54.675
return to the garden and dig up the wine and cheese afterwards.

00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:59.935
In the end, the use of explosives did work, it did serve the purpose

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:05.065
of containing the fire and stopping it spreading even further.

00:08:06.605 --> 00:08:12.765
By September the 5th, three days after it had started, most of the fires

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:17.605
were out, and a day later the fire was declared to be completely over.

00:08:18.995 --> 00:08:23.405
Outside London, for the 3 day period that the fire was

00:08:23.405 --> 00:08:27.805
raging, the rest of the country had no idea what was going on.

00:08:28.915 --> 00:08:36.125
The London Gazette, the main London newspaper at the time, had contained a news story on the

00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:42.445
3rd of September that there was a fire in London that was “continuing with great violence”.

00:08:43.545 --> 00:08:48.245
The following day readers expected more news, but nothing came.

00:08:49.115 --> 00:08:51.425
Then the following day, nothing again.

00:08:52.295 --> 00:08:54.135
Rumours started circulating.

00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:57.485
Was there some kind of foreign attack?

00:08:57.965 --> 00:08:59.615
What was going on in the capital?

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:03.715
There was talk that thousands of people had been killed.

00:09:05.255 --> 00:09:11.385
The period before the Great Fire had seen Britain at war with France, Spain,

00:09:11.555 --> 00:09:16.655
and the Netherlands, and there was also a lot of suspicion towards Catholics.

00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:22.235
The atmosphere was tense, and the fact that London had gone

00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:26.445
silent was greatly worrying for the rest of the country.

00:09:27.745 --> 00:09:31.725
It wasn’t until the 10th of September, a full week later

00:09:31.725 --> 00:09:36.065
that people outside London were to learn what had happened.

00:09:37.475 --> 00:09:43.635
The reason for this was the printing press of The London Gazette had burned down, and

00:09:43.885 --> 00:09:50.675
they had only managed to set up a new press in a churchyard after the fire had died down.

00:09:51.955 --> 00:09:58.185
So, the fire was over, the rest of the country received the news, and could relax in the

00:09:58.185 --> 00:10:04.675
knowledge that this wasn’t a French or Dutch or Spanish plot, that the Catholics weren’t invading.

00:10:05.685 --> 00:10:11.035
But large parts of London were completely burned down, they were toast.

00:10:11.785 --> 00:10:17.685
Over a hundred thousand people were homeless, and large parts of the city were in ruins.

00:10:18.665 --> 00:10:22.535
Although there had been bad fires before, there was nothing

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:26.885
quite of this magnitude, nothing quite as large as this.

00:10:28.225 --> 00:10:33.735
Things that we might take for granted today, like home insurance, didn’t exist.

00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:42.135
And the law stated that tenants, the people who were renting rooms or houses, were

00:10:42.315 --> 00:10:49.105
not only liable for any repairs if the house was damaged, for example in a fire, but

00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:54.955
they also had to continue to pay rent even if they couldn’t live in the property.

00:10:56.025 --> 00:11:00.695
So if you were renting a house that burned down in the Great Fire of

00:11:00.695 --> 00:11:06.255
London, not only did you now not have a house to live in, but you were

00:11:06.275 --> 00:11:11.915
responsible for the cost of rebuilding it and you had to continue to pay rent.

00:11:12.925 --> 00:11:19.035
Evidently, this wasn’t a situation that was feasible, it just couldn’t work, and

00:11:19.205 --> 00:11:25.035
so this led to the creation of something called the Fire Courts, which were legal

00:11:25.035 --> 00:11:30.665
courts to decide who should pay for the repairs, based on who had the money to pay.

00:11:31.705 --> 00:11:35.325
The city needed to be rebuilt as soon as possible.

00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:40.525
It was the capital of England, and the largest and wealthiest city in the country.

00:11:41.355 --> 00:11:45.055
People and businesses needed to get back on their feet.

00:11:46.085 --> 00:11:49.905
But the destruction that the fire had caused presented some

00:11:49.925 --> 00:11:53.175
opportunities that wouldn’t have been possible without it.

00:11:54.495 --> 00:12:02.025
It had destroyed lots of the old, badly built buildings and offered an opportunity for a new start.

00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:07.995
There were ambitious plans for how to build a new, modern city.

00:12:08.635 --> 00:12:14.175
Some plans included grid-style urban design with straight roads.

00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:18.735
Others included wide streets with large squares.

00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:24.085
If you have been to the City of London, you’ll know that the streets

00:12:24.335 --> 00:12:29.565
are neither in a grid system nor have straight roads with large squares.

00:12:30.785 --> 00:12:35.415
The King realised that completely changing the layout of the

00:12:35.415 --> 00:12:39.715
city would have taken too much time and required too much work.

00:12:40.175 --> 00:12:44.555
So instead, most of the original streets were kept,

00:12:44.675 --> 00:12:48.195
which is why the city of London is how it is today.

00:12:49.495 --> 00:12:54.725
The city’s great church, St Paul’s cathedral was to be rebuilt, and the man

00:12:54.725 --> 00:12:59.355
chosen to lead the project was the famous architect Sir Christopher Wren.

00:13:01.065 --> 00:13:06.585
Although he is now most famous for St Paul’s cathedral, he was responsible for

00:13:06.595 --> 00:13:13.075
designing 52 of the churches around the City of London, so if you have ever wondered

00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:20.265
why there is such an architectural consistency, it is the design mainly of one man.

00:13:21.495 --> 00:13:26.375
The fire had also presented opportunities for enterprising businessmen,

00:13:26.785 --> 00:13:32.935
and the concept of fire insurance was born after the Great Fire of London.

00:13:34.065 --> 00:13:40.945
Instead of just paying out in the case of a fire though, these insurance companies actually

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:48.895
operated private fire brigades, because they discovered it was cheaper to prevent these fires from

00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:55.625
doing real damage in the first place than paying out the compensation for damage that they did do.

00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:05.005
And although the fire was most probably just an unfortunate accident, it was no one's fault, the

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:12.015
government looked for scapegoats, looked for people to blame, and it opened an investigation.

00:14:13.045 --> 00:14:19.415
Had someone deliberately thrown a fireball into the bakery in Pudding Lane?

00:14:20.245 --> 00:14:24.545
Could the French, the Dutch, of the Spanish have been responsible?

00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:32.155
Or was it the work of a Catholic, trying to succeed where Guy Fawkes, the man who

00:14:32.155 --> 00:14:37.325
had tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament, had failed 61 years beforehand?

00:14:38.395 --> 00:14:45.365
Indeed, a Frenchman called Robert Hubert actually admitted to starting the fire, but

00:14:45.525 --> 00:14:51.825
he was mentally unstable and it’s now not believed that he had anything to do with it.

00:14:52.965 --> 00:14:57.655
In any case, he was a very convenient scapegoat, being French,

00:14:57.925 --> 00:15:03.915
and he was hanged, he was executed on the 27th October 1666.

00:15:05.535 --> 00:15:09.195
Although this story doesn’t have a happy ending for

00:15:10.415 --> 00:15:14.075
Robert Hubert, it does have a happier ending for London.

00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:21.315
And despite the fire wreaking destruction across the city, very few people died.

00:15:22.625 --> 00:15:28.565
It’s thought that as little as six people died, which out of a population

00:15:28.825 --> 00:15:36.615
of 350,000 and with 13,200 houses destroyed, seems like a bit of a miracle.

00:15:37.885 --> 00:15:44.065
London as a city has evidently not suffered long term, and of course the best news

00:15:44.065 --> 00:15:50.315
of all was that Samuel Pepys managed to return to his house and recover his parmesan.

00:15:53.045 --> 00:15:57.585
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Great Fire of London,

00:15:57.885 --> 00:16:01.315
when one of the world’s great cities almost burned to the ground.

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:05.325
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:16:06.615 --> 00:16:10.335
If you do go to London, make sure you make a trip to

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:13.845
Pudding Lane to see where the fire originally started.

00:16:14.415 --> 00:16:19.855
It obviously looks a little different now, but it is quite amazing to stand

00:16:19.865 --> 00:16:23.985
there and think that it all started from a bakery in this little road.

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:28.995
I should also say that the Museum of London has a fantastic

00:16:28.995 --> 00:16:32.525
section on the Great Fire of London, so make sure you go there too.

00:16:33.915 --> 00:16:37.465
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

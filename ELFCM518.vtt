Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:15.754
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:20.204
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.764 --> 00:00:24.684
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another

00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:29.474
three-part mini-series, this time on the theme of nuclear power.

00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:35.064
In part one, today’s episode, we are going to talk about the early years

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:39.944
of nuclear power, how it developed side-by-side with the proliferation

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:44.604
of nuclear weapons, and how this set the stage for what was to come.

00:00:45.184 --> 00:00:49.544
In part two, we are going to talk about the greatest disaster in the

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:54.494
history of nuclear power: the meltdown at the Chernobyl power station.

00:00:55.184 --> 00:01:01.124
And in part three, we are going to bring it all together and talk about nuclear power today,

00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:06.914
why its proponents believe it plays a key part in reducing climate change, why its critics

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:12.704
believe it remains a dangerous red herring, and what this all means in practical terms.

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:18.854
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about early nuclear power.

00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:28.474
On December 8th, 1953, US President Dwight Eisenhower stood before the United

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:35.470
Nations General Assembly in New York and presented a candid truth to the delegates.

00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:40.394
The world had moved into the atomic age.

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:47.724
Eight years before, with the detonation of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:53.834
the destructive power of atomic weapons had been clearly demonstrated to the world.

00:01:54.644 --> 00:02:01.269
Cities destroyed in an instant, tens, if not hundreds of thousands dead.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.559
This technology now existed, there was no way of putting it back in its box.

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:16.229
And the truth that Eisenhower presented on that day was that atomic technology had developed to

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:23.549
such an extent since then that the bombs that were dropped on Japan would look tiny in comparison.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.709
The hydrogen bomb, which was developed shortly after, was literally hundreds of times more powerful.

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.979
And it wasn’t just the United States that had this technology.

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:43.819
So did Britain, and so did, shock horror, the West’s archenemy the Soviet Union.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.579
He then set out the reality of what we now know as The Cold War.

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:57.419
Countries stockpiling ever more powerful nuclear weapons and pointing them at each other,

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:04.249
knowing full well that launching just one attack would result in a counter-attack, a huge

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:11.577
loss of life, and very possibly an escalation that would spell destruction on a global scale.

00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:16.097
But, Eisenhower pointed out, there was hope.

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:21.617
For in the destructive potential of the atomic bomb lay opportunity.

00:03:23.557 --> 00:03:24.787
As Eisenhower put it:

00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:31.977
" The United States knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future.

00:03:33.057 --> 00:03:37.917
That capability already proved is here now today."

00:03:39.413 --> 00:03:43.863
If you didn’t catch that, he said “The United States knows that

00:03:43.913 --> 00:03:48.043
peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future.

00:03:48.673 --> 00:03:53.053
The capability, already proved, is here today.”

00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:57.913
He was, of course, talking about nuclear power.

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:04.996
Now, at the time of this speech, which would later be called the “Atoms for Peace” speech,

00:04:05.396 --> 00:04:11.046
there were no nuclear power plants, the first one would only be completed a year later.

00:04:11.856 --> 00:04:17.876
But scientists knew that generating power from nuclear sources was possible,

00:04:18.386 --> 00:04:22.756
it was a very similar principle as used when creating a nuclear weapon.

00:04:24.026 --> 00:04:29.876
As a side note, we did do a three-part mini-series on the Atomic Bomb a couple of years ago,

00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:38.896
those are episodes 284, 285 and 286, and they cover the history of the discovery of atomic

00:04:38.896 --> 00:04:44.336
energy and how it works, so I’d encourage you to listen to those if you haven’t done so already.

00:04:44.766 --> 00:04:47.716
I’ll put a link in the description so you can find them easily.

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:54.386
But as a brief recap of how nuclear energy is created, the chemical element

00:04:54.396 --> 00:05:01.816
Uranium is mined and then enriched, separating out an isotope called Uranium-235.

00:05:02.646 --> 00:05:09.806
Then, a neutron is fired at the nucleus of a Uranium-235 atom, splitting it.

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:14.906
This releases huge amounts of energy and results in more

00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:19.966
neutrons hitting other nuclei, and the chain reaction continues.

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:23.146
Imagine a row of dominoes.

00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:27.346
When you knock over the first one, it hits the next, and so on.

00:05:28.186 --> 00:05:34.926
In a similar way, when a neutron hits a uranium atom, it splits and releases more

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:40.576
neutrons, triggering a chain reaction that releases enormous amounts of energy.

00:05:42.036 --> 00:05:49.184
In an atomic bomb, with a large concentration of highly enriched Uranium-235, this causes a

00:05:49.194 --> 00:05:56.884
huge, destructive explosion, but if it could be done with uranium that was less enriched, then

00:05:56.894 --> 00:06:03.704
the energy given out by the reaction could be controlled and converted into usable energy.

00:06:05.294 --> 00:06:10.924
In practical terms, the nuclear reaction would give out large amounts of heat, which could

00:06:10.924 --> 00:06:17.334
boil water, turning it into steam, which could power turbines and generate electricity.

00:06:18.324 --> 00:06:24.544
And, ta-da, that is a very simplified version of how nuclear energy works.

00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:27.754
Now, back to Dwight Eisenhower.

00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:32.344
His words marked a dramatic turning point.

00:06:33.504 --> 00:06:40.404
What had once been a source of unimaginable destruction was now a technology that could fuel

00:06:40.404 --> 00:06:47.214
cities, power industry, and even bring light to places that had never seen electricity before.

00:06:48.984 --> 00:06:53.694
He spoke of the need for collaboration, of bringing together the

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:59.074
world’s brightest minds to work together on nuclear energy, and how

00:06:59.074 --> 00:07:04.024
knowledge should be shared, not kept in isolated government agencies.

00:07:05.914 --> 00:07:12.494
A year later, he passed the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which allowed the U.S.

00:07:12.494 --> 00:07:17.894
government to share previously secret nuclear information with private companies.

00:07:19.464 --> 00:07:23.384
What’s more, it allowed for information and knowledge sharing to

00:07:23.384 --> 00:07:28.124
be global, or at least between the United States and its allies.

00:07:29.294 --> 00:07:33.834
The Pandora’s Box of splitting the atom had been opened, so

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:38.084
the world should at least reap the benefits of what was inside.

00:07:39.034 --> 00:07:41.184
And it did seem revolutionary.

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:46.714
The promise of nuclear energy was one of limitless, clean energy.

00:07:47.244 --> 00:07:51.844
Nuclear power stations would have no ugly black smoke coming out of the top,

00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:56.204
there would be no dusty coal trucks driving in and out of the plant every

00:07:56.204 --> 00:08:01.034
day, there would just be harmless water vapour coming out of a large chimney.

00:08:01.694 --> 00:08:06.964
They could work day and night, they needed to be built next to a river or sea

00:08:06.964 --> 00:08:11.994
or some source of water, but other than that, they could be built anywhere.

00:08:13.155 --> 00:08:17.942
And unlike coal or oil, it seemed, at least initially,

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:21.342
that there was no limit to the amount of Uranium.

00:08:22.622 --> 00:08:29.002
Before long, nuclear power plants had sprung up in the USSR, the UK, and the

00:08:29.002 --> 00:08:34.252
United States, and were beginning to pop up all over the developed world.

00:08:35.772 --> 00:08:42.132
In 1972, the world passed 100 active nuclear reactors, most of them

00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:47.742
located in the United States, the Soviet Union, and Europe, and a year

00:08:47.742 --> 00:08:52.632
later there was a shock that would send this number climbing even higher.

00:08:53.422 --> 00:09:01.632
On the 6th of October 1973, at the start of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, Egypt, Syria

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:08.782
and a coalition of Arab countries launched an attack on Israel, primarily in an attempt to

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:15.900
regain the Sinai Peninsula, which had been captured by Israel during the Six-Day-War of 1967.

00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:21.992
Israel’s allies rallied in support, and Israel proved victorious.

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:30.162
Now, why this is important in the context of nuclear energy is that in the aftermath of the

00:09:30.162 --> 00:09:37.514
Yom Kippur War, OPEC, or the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, announced

00:09:37.674 --> 00:09:43.274
that it would impose an embargo on any country that had supported Israel in the war.

00:09:44.344 --> 00:09:49.714
As you may know, OPEC members are almost exclusively Muslim countries, with

00:09:49.724 --> 00:09:56.044
Venezuela being the only exception, and this organisation that effectively controlled

00:09:56.174 --> 00:10:00.857
the world’s supply of oil sought to punish countries that had supported Israel.

00:10:01.277 --> 00:10:07.317
The US was the primary target, as it had sent $2.2 billion worth of

00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:12.407
arms to Israel, but several other countries were formally embargoed,

00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:17.097
meaning that they could not buy oil from any OPEC member state.

00:10:18.607 --> 00:10:24.327
And even those that weren’t specifically targeted by the embargo felt its impact.

00:10:25.377 --> 00:10:32.377
The price of oil skyrocketed, going from $2.90 a barrel before the embargo

00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:40.128
to $11.65 a barrel in January of 1974, a more than four times increase.

00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:46.728
This sudden spike in oil prices sent shockwaves through economies around the world.

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:51.449
Factories, transportation, and entire industries had been

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:55.339
relying on cheap oil, but now costs were skyrocketing.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:02.599
Everyday people were hit too—drivers in the United States and Europe suddenly found themselves

00:11:02.599 --> 00:11:07.743
paying double, triple the price to fill up their tanks, if they could even find petrol.

00:11:08.823 --> 00:11:12.123
Governments everywhere began to realise just how

00:11:12.133 --> 00:11:16.303
vulnerable they were to the whims of oil-producing nations.

00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:22.743
This was really the first time many Western countries saw how deeply they

00:11:22.743 --> 00:11:28.273
depended on oil and how quickly that reliance could become a weakness.

00:11:29.493 --> 00:11:34.343
In other words, energy security became of vital importance.

00:11:35.693 --> 00:11:40.623
Suddenly, the idea of an alternative energy source, one that didn’t

00:11:40.643 --> 00:11:46.066
depend on oil and seemed almost limitless, became extremely appealing.

00:11:47.546 --> 00:11:52.142
And this is where nuclear power seemed to offer an answer.

00:11:53.456 --> 00:12:00.486
Unlike coal, oil, or natural gas, uranium was not controlled by a single group of countries.

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:06.726
Nuclear reactors, if well-designed, could run almost indefinitely

00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:11.586
without interruption, providing a consistent, stable source of energy.

00:12:12.986 --> 00:12:16.056
Across the Western world, governments doubled down

00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:19.636
on nuclear energy as a path to energy independence.

00:12:20.446 --> 00:12:25.606
France, which had been pretty much exclusively reliant on foreign oil to

00:12:25.606 --> 00:12:31.316
provide its entire energy supply before 1973, decided to launch a nuclear

00:12:31.356 --> 00:12:36.426
energy program dubbed the Messmer Plan, after the Prime Minister at the time.

00:12:38.036 --> 00:12:42.576
This ambitious programme set a goal of 80 nuclear plants

00:12:42.576 --> 00:12:48.247
by 1985 and a total of 170 plants by the year 2000.

00:12:49.765 --> 00:12:54.496
Now, we’ll talk more about how they did and the impact of this in part

00:12:54.526 --> 00:12:59.416
three of this mini-series, but, as you may know, in terms of meeting

00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:04.096
France’s goal of energy security and independence, it has worked.

00:13:05.136 --> 00:13:08.426
France, despite having relatively low fossil fuel

00:13:08.426 --> 00:13:12.486
reserves, is the largest energy exporter in Europe.

00:13:13.636 --> 00:13:17.796
In other words, it produces more energy than it uses.

00:13:19.016 --> 00:13:25.496
And this is thanks to nuclear power, which is responsible for around 70% of all French energy.

00:13:26.356 --> 00:13:31.306
Again, we’ll talk more about this in part three, and look at how the situation

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:35.616
in France is very different to the situation in several other European countries,

00:13:35.874 --> 00:13:42.476
but the point to remember is that the 1973 oil crisis shook the French so much

00:13:42.726 --> 00:13:47.946
that it set the wheels in motion for the energy security that France enjoys today.

00:13:49.576 --> 00:13:54.636
In the United States, too, the government invested heavily in nuclear infrastructure.

00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:57.816
By the 1980s, the U.S.

00:13:57.976 --> 00:14:03.396
was starting up a new nuclear reactor every 17 days on average.

00:14:04.566 --> 00:14:09.306
It seemed as though nuclear power would indeed fulfil Eisenhower’s vision of

00:14:09.576 --> 00:14:15.546
“Atoms for Peace,” giving the world a clean and almost limitless energy source.

00:14:16.886 --> 00:14:21.976
But as the reactors went up, so did the voices of protest.

00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:28.046
In West Germany, grassroots protests started to emerge, not only

00:14:28.056 --> 00:14:33.216
questioning the safety of nuclear power but also its environmental impact.

00:14:34.196 --> 00:14:41.186
People worried about radiation leaks, accidents, and the long-term effects of nuclear waste.

00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:48.776
These protests would grow into a major movement and eventually lead to the formation of

00:14:48.776 --> 00:14:53.996
the German Green Party, one of the most influential environmental movements in Europe.

00:14:55.136 --> 00:14:57.216
And it wasn’t just Germany.

00:14:57.806 --> 00:15:03.566
Across the world, people were beginning to question the wisdom of building so many reactors.

00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:09.269
For all its promises, nuclear energy had its risks.

00:15:10.379 --> 00:15:15.419
In 1979, an incident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in

00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:20.276
Pennsylvania, in the United States, seemed to confirm the worst fears.

00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:26.416
Although there was no significant release of radiation, the partial meltdown

00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:32.046
captured global headlines and rattled public confidence in nuclear energy.

00:15:32.986 --> 00:15:37.276
It seemed like a disaster had been ever so narrowly averted.

00:15:38.676 --> 00:15:43.003
By the 1980s, these concerns were beginning to slow down the

00:15:43.003 --> 00:15:46.703
construction of new plants, particularly in Western countries.

00:15:47.313 --> 00:15:51.123
The momentum behind nuclear power had started to shift.

00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:56.083
And yet, at the same time, countries that had already

00:15:56.093 --> 00:15:59.293
invested in nuclear energy had seen its potential.

00:16:00.923 --> 00:16:04.333
For instance, by the early 1980s, the U.S.

00:16:04.343 --> 00:16:07.373
had the world’s largest fleet of reactors, which

00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:10.823
were producing just under 20% of the country’s power.

00:16:11.923 --> 00:16:17.468
Even more impressively, these reactors had become a lot more efficient and were running at

00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:22.888
nearly full capacity most of the time, which is something that few other countries had managed.

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:28.288
But, for all of the enthusiasm there might have been for nuclear energy,

00:16:28.658 --> 00:16:34.588
and the improvements in safety and productivity, in 1986 something happened

00:16:34.748 --> 00:16:39.298
that would fundamentally change public opinion: the Chernobyl disaster.

00:16:40.108 --> 00:16:45.018
Chernobyl showed the world that nuclear energy, while powerful and

00:16:45.078 --> 00:16:49.998
clean when it worked, could also be incredibly dangerous when it didn’t.

00:16:51.068 --> 00:16:55.968
The explosion and subsequent fire at the Chernobyl plant spread radiation

00:16:55.998 --> 00:17:01.438
across Europe and caused untold health, environmental, and social impacts.

00:17:02.058 --> 00:17:05.468
It became a symbol of the dangers of nuclear energy

00:17:05.748 --> 00:17:08.958
and cast a long shadow over the nuclear industry.

00:17:10.118 --> 00:17:14.868
And that, my friends, is what we have to look forward to in the next episode.

00:17:17.058 --> 00:17:21.808
OK then, that is it for today's episode on early nuclear power.

00:17:22.237 --> 00:17:25.844
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and

00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:30.054
if you'd never heard Dwight Eisenhower speak before, well you have now.

00:17:31.094 --> 00:17:36.784
As a reminder, this was part one of a three-part mini-series on the theme of nuclear power.

00:17:37.224 --> 00:17:41.604
Next up we will be trawling through the rubble of the Chernobyl Disaster,

00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:46.193
and in part three we will be looking at the state of nuclear power today.

00:17:47.013 --> 00:17:51.543
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:17:51.923 --> 00:17:57.263
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

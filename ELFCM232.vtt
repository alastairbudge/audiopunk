Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:17.274
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:21.594
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:28.904
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about When Britain Killed Its King.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:35.534
On January 30th, 1649, outside the Palace of Whitehall, in

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:40.864
central London, a man walked up to a large, raised stage.

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:46.914
Below him, thousands of people waited eagerly to see history made.

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:52.514
The man knelt on the ground, and made a signal with his hand.

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:59.964
On this signal, a man whose face was covered raised an axe high and brought

00:01:00.034 --> 00:01:05.054
it down on the other man’s neck, cutting it clean off from his body.

00:01:06.284 --> 00:01:13.904
That man was King Charles the First of England, the first and only British king to be executed.

00:01:14.764 --> 00:01:21.254
In this episode we are going to tell this story, of the English Civil War, how Britain

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:27.654
came to kill its king, what happened in the subsequent 11 years when there was no official

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:34.244
king, why the monarchy was eventually restored, and how it changed the country forever.

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:40.194
This episode has not only been a really fun one to write, but it also deals

00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:44.934
with an important period in British history, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.912
OK then, When Britain Killed Its King.

00:01:51.072 --> 00:01:57.242
For many people, when they think about kings or queens, the UK comes to mind.

00:01:57.942 --> 00:02:01.752
Unlike other countries, France, Germany or Italy, for example,

00:02:02.002 --> 00:02:05.812
the UK still has a monarchy, there is a king or queen.

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:09.482
Queen Elizabeth, the current queen of the United

00:02:09.482 --> 00:02:14.812
Kingdom, has been on the throne for 70 years, since 1952.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:22.032
And for anyone under the age of 70, in fact, they will have never known another British

00:02:22.062 --> 00:02:27.872
monarch, and no living person has ever known a United Kingdom without a monarch.

00:02:28.422 --> 00:02:34.792
And when you think about countries that have had revolutions and decided to execute their

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:40.772
monarchs, you might think of the guillotine and the French Revolution, not of Britain.

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:48.232
But it might surprise you to find out that Britain too killed a king and got rid of its monarchy,

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:55.542
and indeed the country lived without a monarch for a period of 11 years in the 17th century.

00:02:56.482 --> 00:03:05.152
This period, from 1649 to 1660 is known as the Interregnum - or the time between reigns.

00:03:06.012 --> 00:03:09.782
It is this unique and fascinating and turbulent period

00:03:10.052 --> 00:03:12.762
that we are going to explore in today‘s episode.

00:03:13.852 --> 00:03:20.312
Our journey will involve five different stages – all interlinked: the background

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:25.802
to to the dispute and the nature of the four countries involved at its start; the

00:03:25.832 --> 00:03:31.872
causes of the civil wars and the major events, especially the battles; the trial

00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:38.212
and and execution of the King; the Interregnum or period of rule when there was no

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:44.402
king and the people who had deposed and executed him were in power; and finally, the

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:51.402
restoration or return to power of the next king, Charles II, who was the dead king’s son.

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:57.282
It is quite a complicated period in British history, so I will try

00:03:57.282 --> 00:04:02.492
to stick to the most important parts and also to give you a clear

00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:07.712
sense of the chronology – in other words the key dates and events.

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:11.252
Right, let’s start with some background.

00:04:12.492 --> 00:04:20.007
There had been a monarch, a king or queen, on the throne of England since the year 849.

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:28.082
So why, what circumstances caused the country to decide that it didn’t want one 800 years later,

00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:35.792
in 1649, and to decide that it didn’t just want to get rid of the king, it publicly executed him?

00:04:36.632 --> 00:04:42.212
Well, let me paint you a picture of life in Britain in the early 17th century.

00:04:43.202 --> 00:04:47.862
King Charles the First had been on the throne since 1625.

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:52.582
What this meant in practical terms was that he was

00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:56.482
king of the Kingdom of England, Scotland and Ireland.

00:04:57.122 --> 00:05:02.392
The Kingdom of England also included Wales, and the Kingdom of Ireland

00:05:02.502 --> 00:05:08.862
included all of Ireland, so Charles was the ruler of all of the British Isles.

00:05:09.862 --> 00:05:13.882
It may seem strange to you but the King saw himself

00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:19.112
as ruling on behalf of God, as God’s agent on earth.

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:26.772
This was a really important belief or doctrine and was called the Divine Right of Kings.

00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:35.412
Although Charles had a small group of advisors, called the Privy Council and a larger group of

00:05:35.412 --> 00:05:42.202
men elected to Parliament [members of parliament or MPs as they are now known], he saw himself

00:05:42.472 --> 00:05:49.022
as the decision maker; he expected to be able to rule without the support of Parliament.

00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:55.872
In other words, Charles wanted to be an absolute ruler or autocrat.

00:05:57.362 --> 00:06:04.462
Although Britain may have had elements of a democracy, a fledgling or embryonic

00:06:04.482 --> 00:06:10.942
democracy let’s say, it was very much a dictatorship with some democratic elements.

00:06:12.222 --> 00:06:17.002
To add to the mixture, Charles was a vain and by all

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:21.102
accounts rather stupid man who always thought he was right.

00:06:22.142 --> 00:06:27.822
And although Britain was 100 years away from the Industrial Revolution which would

00:06:27.982 --> 00:06:35.662
transform the country and create a great deal of wealth, it was, in 1639, prosperous

00:06:35.802 --> 00:06:40.642
in the rural areas where the profitable trade in wool was the main industry.

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:49.102
At the same time, London, which was even then about six times the size of the second largest

00:06:49.102 --> 00:06:57.335
city, Norwich, had many wealthy people and even had its own semi-official army, the militias.

00:06:58.575 --> 00:07:04.425
As the English wealthy business people and land owners grew in power, so

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:10.445
understandably they expected to have more influence on how the country was run.

00:07:11.705 --> 00:07:16.555
This was especially the case with three matters which were vital

00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:21.345
background to the dispute which led to the first English civil war.

00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:25.575
The first one has to do with tax.

00:07:26.405 --> 00:07:31.595
Although the King had considerable private money of his own, for spending

00:07:31.595 --> 00:07:36.185
to do with the country, he needed to raise additional money through taxes.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:42.535
Parliament often would not vote to raise or authorise taxes as

00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:46.205
they did not agree with what the king wanted to spend the money on.

00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:50.895
This was often, understandably, an area of conflict.

00:07:52.045 --> 00:07:56.745
The second battle ground or area of dispute was religion.

00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:03.835
In England the Church of England, otherwise known as the Anglican Church, was Protestant,

00:08:04.255 --> 00:08:09.685
following the break with the Catholic Church under Henry VIII more than a century earlier.

00:08:10.455 --> 00:08:15.215
However, there were still many people in England who continued to follow

00:08:15.405 --> 00:08:20.115
the old faith of Catholicism, there were still plenty of Catholics.

00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:26.785
There was great suspicion amongst the most hardline or fanatical protestants,

00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:31.895
especially those who were described as puritans, that the King was

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:37.355
secretly inclined towards Catholicism, that he was a secret Catholic.

00:08:38.945 --> 00:08:43.385
This religion was linked in their minds with foreigners, especially

00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:48.365
those from England‘s most fierce enemies, France and Spain.

00:08:49.705 --> 00:08:55.125
Something that added fuel to this already combustible fire was the fact

00:08:55.315 --> 00:09:00.915
that the King had married a Catholic, Princess Henrietta Maria of France.

00:09:02.115 --> 00:09:07.265
The third area of dispute links with the first and has to do with

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:12.315
economic policy, especially as it provided funds for foreign wars.

00:09:13.215 --> 00:09:21.025
Charles had conducted an expensive and disastrous war with Spain between 1625 and 1629.

00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:26.165
Parliament refused to vote for more money for this foolish war.

00:09:26.665 --> 00:09:32.465
The King had to resort to an unpopular and illegal method of raising

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:38.685
funds: he forced people to lend him money and imprisoned those who didn't.

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:45.115
This gives you a sense of what Charles thought he could get away with - he thought

00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:51.225
that Parliament essentially existed as a way to provide him with whatever he needed.

00:09:52.505 --> 00:09:59.195
This dispute led in 1629 to the King eventually dismissing or

00:09:59.505 --> 00:10:04.505
dissolving Parliament and not recalling it again for 11 years.

00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:09.885
Essentially, he got rid of the main element of democracy in the country.

00:10:11.105 --> 00:10:16.755
OK, let’s move on to the events and unrest which led to the first Civil War.

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:21.845
Problems with religion were not confined to England.

00:10:22.145 --> 00:10:27.025
Scotland was much more dominated by hardline protestants than England.

00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:31.975
The influence of the radical Swiss preacher, John Calvin had

00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:35.625
been especially strong in Scotland the century beforehand.

00:10:36.495 --> 00:10:41.775
King Charles unwisely tried to impose on Scotland his own idea

00:10:41.965 --> 00:10:45.715
of a prayer book, which was called the Book of Common Prayer.

00:10:46.795 --> 00:10:54.105
It was a terrible error of judgment, and the Scots simply said “no, we’re not accepting this”.

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:59.585
When the Scots would not accept Charles‘s command, he tried

00:10:59.585 --> 00:11:04.495
to beat them into submission and started a war in 1639.

00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:09.155
As well as leading him into further conflict with

00:11:09.155 --> 00:11:14.415
Parliament, Charles’s unwise war led to a humiliating defeat.

00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:21.305
Back in London, in January 1642, the King tried to arrest the

00:11:21.305 --> 00:11:24.835
members of Parliament who were leading a rebellion against him.

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:33.025
He wanted to imprison them and then likely execute them for treason or rebellion against the king.

00:11:34.315 --> 00:11:40.435
Very sensibly, the MPs involved, including a man we will hear much of later,

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:46.325
a strict protestant called Oliver Cromwell, decided to not attend Parliament.

00:11:47.465 --> 00:11:53.225
Clearly, trust between the monarch and Parliament had broken down completely.

00:11:53.485 --> 00:11:55.175
There was no going back.

00:11:56.255 --> 00:12:01.715
By June that year, Charles had moved his court and army to the city of

00:12:01.715 --> 00:12:07.455
York in the north of England, and a full-blown civil war was imminent.

00:12:08.555 --> 00:12:12.395
The forces of Parliament, or the Parliamentarians, as

00:12:12.395 --> 00:12:15.575
they came to be called, set up their base in London.

00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:23.165
A formal declaration of war followed and the first major battle, an inconclusive

00:12:23.165 --> 00:12:30.265
one, took place in October 1642 at Edgehill in Warwickshire, in the heart of England.

00:12:31.645 --> 00:12:37.195
I will not attempt to deal with all of the elements of the first English Civil War,

00:12:37.455 --> 00:12:43.615
but will firstly try to give you some flavour of what kind of war it was and secondly

00:12:43.725 --> 00:12:48.625
tell you what were the factors which led to the Parliamentarians eventually winning.

00:12:49.865 --> 00:12:56.395
Like any war it involved a tremendous amount of destruction, death and suffering.

00:12:56.855 --> 00:13:01.545
As with any civil war, it divided communities and families,

00:13:01.815 --> 00:13:05.785
even setting brother against brother, father against son.

00:13:07.095 --> 00:13:13.225
Whereas some civil wars, the Spanish Civil War, for example, set different

00:13:13.235 --> 00:13:18.215
social classes against each other, the first English Civil War did not

00:13:18.225 --> 00:13:24.715
divide simply by social class, it wasn’t a case of left vs right, poor vs.

00:13:24.715 --> 00:13:25.165
rich.

00:13:26.135 --> 00:13:31.535
Religion was a big element, with the hardline protestants or puritans

00:13:31.715 --> 00:13:35.785
[as they were sometimes known] being more likely to side with Parliament.

00:13:36.895 --> 00:13:41.625
Geographical region also played a part, with the King strongest in the

00:13:41.635 --> 00:13:46.225
north of England, the Midlands and much of the south and west, while

00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:50.685
the Parliamentarians were strongest in London and the East of England.

00:13:51.775 --> 00:13:58.275
A major factor in the victory of the Parliamentarians or Roundheads as they were sometimes

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:04.595
called, was that, although they occupied a smaller portion of the country, they held the

00:14:04.605 --> 00:14:10.775
more significant parts of it than the King’s side – they held the ports, making it easier to

00:14:10.775 --> 00:14:18.285
trade, and they held the places where gunpowder and ammunition were stored, called “arsenals”.

00:14:18.985 --> 00:14:23.335
For the football fans out there, yes the football team “Arsenal”

00:14:23.445 --> 00:14:27.665
gets its name because it was founded next to the Royal Arsenal.

00:14:28.715 --> 00:14:35.015
As to the kind of warfare waged, the kind of war that was actually fought, there

00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:42.255
were lots of small battles or skirmishes, many sieges of towns and a handful of major

00:14:42.255 --> 00:14:49.175
battles which typically involved between 12,000 and 20,000 soldiers on each side.

00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:54.755
Cavalry was important, so that’s soldiers on top of horses.

00:14:55.115 --> 00:15:02.675
So was the use of infantry, the foot soldiers, who would be armed with large spears or pikes.

00:15:04.055 --> 00:15:08.045
Cannons destroyed old style castles and city walls.

00:15:08.335 --> 00:15:14.695
You can still see many examples of castles whose fortifications were destroyed in these wars.

00:15:15.885 --> 00:15:21.215
A crucial factor was that, until 1644, neither side

00:15:21.445 --> 00:15:25.595
had what we would call nowadays a professional army.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:34.325
However, in 1644 Parliament created a professional army, known as the New Model Army.

00:15:35.325 --> 00:15:40.315
This was very well trained and therefore disciplined in battle.

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:47.182
It was a vital factor behind the decisive victory of the Parliamentarians in June

00:15:47.392 --> 00:15:54.055
1645 at Naseby in Lincolnshire when they defeated the King’s forces for good.

00:15:55.635 --> 00:15:58.921
King Charles tried to figure out a way to get out of the

00:15:59.045 --> 00:16:03.725
situation, and to make a deal with Parliament, but there was none.

00:16:04.465 --> 00:16:11.125
He surrendered to the Scottish army in 1646, who were on the side of the Parliamentarians.

00:16:11.985 --> 00:16:17.022
This was the end of the First English Civil War, but let’s remember that

00:16:17.022 --> 00:16:21.812
Charles I is technically still the King of England, Scotland and Ireland.

00:16:23.342 --> 00:16:29.972
Back to the chronology and onto what is called the Second Civil War which I will deal with briefly.

00:16:30.942 --> 00:16:38.852
In this war, which occurred after the King’s surrender to the Scottish army in May of 1646, there

00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:46.502
was a rebellion both of the English Navy and also of various remaining pockets of Royalist forces.

00:16:47.602 --> 00:16:53.962
The result of these uprisings was that the New Model Army, with Oliver Cromwell as

00:16:53.962 --> 00:17:00.232
one of its leading commanders, seized power, expelling the more moderate members

00:17:00.232 --> 00:17:05.212
of parliament and executing the leaders of the various uprisings against them.

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:11.272
This led to Parliament becoming smaller in number and, critically,

00:17:11.532 --> 00:17:16.152
becoming composed of much more extreme, hardline members.

00:17:17.202 --> 00:17:20.302
Now, we need to move on to the third part of the story,

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:24.528
which is the trial and execution of King Charles I.

00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:31.282
After trying his luck negotiating both with Parliament and the Scots, he was handed

00:17:31.282 --> 00:17:38.972
over to Parliament in 1647, and in January of 1649 he was accused of treason.

00:17:40.282 --> 00:17:45.352
The charge against the captured King was that he had tried “to achieve a

00:17:45.412 --> 00:17:51.492
tyrannical power” and to “overthrow the rights and liberties of the people”.

00:17:52.562 --> 00:17:57.332
He stood trial, although he refused to accept the legality

00:17:57.482 --> 00:18:01.352
of the process, and he was unsurprisingly found guilty.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.702
As we heard at the start of the episode, he was

00:18:05.702 --> 00:18:11.132
beheaded at Whitehall in London on 30th January 1649.

00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:17.792
British monarchs had been killed in battle before, but Charles was and still

00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:23.752
is the only British monarch to have been executed following a trial, and Oliver

00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:30.112
Cromwell was the man held responsible, for better or for worse, for his execution.

00:18:31.352 --> 00:18:36.122
For many people, even people in Britain today, the killing of a

00:18:36.122 --> 00:18:42.912
king – or regicide as it is known – was a terrible, evil, ungodly thing.

00:18:43.572 --> 00:18:51.352
Remember, the divine right of kings is this idea that the king or queen is literally placed on the

00:18:51.352 --> 00:18:59.860
throne by God, and so the idea that God’s own king could be murdered was, well, it was heretical.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.040
Each year on the 30th of January there is a procession of people towards

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:12.360
Whitehall, mainly dressed in 17th-century costume, that commemorates his execution.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:20.320
I have a photo of myself maybe aged eight, my siblings and cousins that shows us dressed

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.870
up and taking part in this procession, although the whole event was much more about

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:31.520
having fun dressing up and waving swords and shields than it was about commemorating

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.530
Charles‘s execution or martyrdom as it was viewed, especially in Catholic France and Spain.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:46.500
So, we have had two civil wars and the death of Charles I; we now need to cover the third Civil

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:54.450
War, the return of the next king and then finally, the lasting influence of these events on Britain.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.760
The Third Civil War went as follows.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:05.260
Although they didn’t like him as an individual, the Scots had been against the execution of Charles.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.050
They were angry that they had not been listened to, although

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.070
their army had been an important factor in the defeat of the King.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:19.230
As a result, they invaded England with Charles‘s son, Prince Charles,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.390
as their leader, with the intention of putting him on the throne.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:31.720
By now, however, the New Model Army, led by Oliver Cromwell, was quite a formidable force.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:37.890
It initially defeated the Scots at Dunbar just south of Edinburgh in September

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:46.120
1650 then, after the Scots had invaded England, Cromwell's army of 32,000 troops

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:52.360
defeated Charles and the Scots’ 16,000 strong army at Worcester, in central England.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.300
Prince Charles now was a fugitive – pursued by the Roundheads,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.820
and he famously hid in an oak tree as part of his escape.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.970
Those of you who are admirers of English pubs will know

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:12.370
that one of the most popular pub names is the Royal Oak.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:17.470
Each one of these pubs commemorates that story of Prince Charles

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.430
hiding in an oak tree, before he managed to get to safety in France.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:29.660
Well, having got rid of the royalist threat, first of King Charles the first and then his

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:35.250
son, Prince Charles, what does the leader of the Parliamentarians, Oliver Cromwell do?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.440
Well, he argues with his MPs about what sort of constitution or rulebook should be established.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:51.180
In the end, no one can agree and, to cut a very long story short, Oliver Cromwell

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:58.010
ends up by ignoring Parliament and ruling pretty much as a dictator – which for

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.960
many people must have seemed like no improvement on what they had under Charles.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:09.660
This type of rule was described as the Protectorate, which, along with

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.470
the name of Cromwell‘s small advisory committee, the Committee of Safety,

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:19.390
will probably sound quite sinister to you, it sounds almost Orwellian.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:26.640
The final stop in our whistle stop tour of this action-packed 21 years of

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.180
British history is the return of a king, otherwise known as the Restoration.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.900
Oliver Cromwell, who had ruled the country with an iron

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.560
fist, died in 1658, and was replaced by his son, Richard.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:48.700
Influential people in England, especially the head of the Army, a man

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.930
called General Monck, decided that this new ruler, Richard Cromwell,

00:22:54.310 --> 00:23:00.060
was not up to the job; so he contacted the exiled Prince Charles.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:06.540
Prince Charles was invited back and was crowned as Charles II,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:13.260
ruling from 1660, and the country has had a king or queen ever since.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.380
This period directly after Charles II was put back on the throne

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.420
was called the Restoration, because the monarchy was “restored”.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.790
During the Protectorate, religion had become stricter, theatres had

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:35.510
been closed and the Puritans made sure that not much fun was had.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:44.846
So the country was ready for a party and in Charles II it had found a true party animal.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:50.560
He was known as the Merry Monarch - merry means happy, by the way.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:57.010
And he set an example of extravagant living – wine, women and song.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:03.770
In fact, many of the current English aristocracy trace their titles

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:08.970
back to Charles II and his at least 12 illegitimate children.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.320
So, finally, let us consider what were the main

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.500
influences of this passage of events on British history.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:24.220
Well, most immediately, as happens with civil wars in general,

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.780
there was awful destruction, bitterness, death and suffering.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:35.840
Just focussing on England, where most of the destruction happened, it is estimated

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:42.450
that around 200,000 people died, half of whom were men who died in battle.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:49.630
Given that the English population was about 4.5 million people, this was just

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:55.420
under 5% of the population – a higher proportion than died in the 1st World War.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.250
A second consequence was the storing up of resentment

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.550
about English rule in both Ireland and Scotland.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:11.060
Both countries were occupied by Oliver Cromwell and his newly professionalised army.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.640
The Irish were treated particularly brutally, especially with the terrible

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:22.810
massacre of civilians in 1649 after the sieges of Drogheda and Wexford.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.190
And if you mention the name Oliver Cromwell in Ireland,

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.900
you will certainly make some people very upset.

00:25:31.573 --> 00:25:36.460
Thirdly, the creation of the New Model Army was the beginning of the

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:41.480
British Army and therefore, for better or for worse, the start of a

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:47.550
revived sense of British military capability to defeat armies abroad.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:54.130
In Europe this culminated in the victory of the Grand Alliance coalition

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.530
led by John Churchill, yes an ancestor of Winston Churchill, over

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:05.550
the supposedly invincible forces of Louis XIV at Blenheim in 1704.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:14.000
And with this increasing power of its new, professional army came the rise of the British Empire.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:21.310
Finally, it became apparent several years into the Restoration that a more progressive

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:27.160
and rational balance had eventually been struck between the monarch and Parliament.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:35.170
Arguably, this development could not have happened had it not been for all the bloody turbulence

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:41.300
of the three civil wars and the flawed experiment and the failure of the Protectorate.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:47.340
The newly established constitutional monarchy helped create stability

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.553
and led to the foundation of many important institutions which increased

00:26:52.603 --> 00:26:57.023
prosperity and laid the foundations for The Industrial Revolution.

00:26:58.653 --> 00:27:03.903
Let’s conclude with the man regarded by some as one of the greatest English people

00:27:03.923 --> 00:27:10.533
of all time, and by others as a merciless and power-hungry dictator, Oliver Cromwell.

00:27:11.509 --> 00:27:17.869
Oliver Cromwell had died a hero in England, and was buried in Westminster Abbey in London.

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:23.999
When he was made king, Charles II pardoned most of his father’s opponents,

00:27:24.199 --> 00:27:29.389
but for those who had signed his father’s death warrant there was no mercy.

00:27:30.199 --> 00:27:35.699
The only problem for Charles II was that the man he held most responsible for

00:27:35.699 --> 00:27:42.289
his father’s death had died in 1658, a year before Charles II was made king.

00:27:43.609 --> 00:27:50.119
There’s not much you can do to punish a dead man, but Charles II sure did try.

00:27:51.339 --> 00:27:57.289
On the 30th of January 1661, two and a half years after he had died

00:27:57.529 --> 00:28:02.799
and on the anniversary of the execution of Charles I, Oliver Cromwell’s

00:28:02.829 --> 00:28:08.419
body was dug up, hung in chains, and then his head was cut off.

00:28:09.503 --> 00:28:12.643
During the restoration of the monarchy, although he

00:28:12.643 --> 00:28:16.823
was dead, Oliver Cromwell was public enemy number one.

00:28:17.643 --> 00:28:22.313
But with time, he has come to be viewed with less hostility.

00:28:23.123 --> 00:28:27.333
He is certainly one of the most important individuals in British political

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:31.943
history, and his statue stands proudly outside the Houses of Parliament.

00:28:33.237 --> 00:28:38.767
And, unlike many others, at the moment no one is campaigning to have it taken down.

00:28:41.363 --> 00:28:45.887
OK then, that is it for today's episode on When Britain

00:28:45.927 --> 00:28:49.853
Killed Its King, the English Civil War and the Interregnum.

00:28:50.637 --> 00:28:55.817
I hope it's been an interesting one, and if you weren’t aware of it before, now you know

00:28:55.827 --> 00:29:01.207
a little bit about what happened when Britain experimented with life without a monarch.

00:29:02.197 --> 00:29:05.557

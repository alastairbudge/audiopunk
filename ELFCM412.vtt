Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.099
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.100
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.110
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a sensitive topic: mental health.

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.370
It’s a topic that affects every single one of us,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.760
with some of us struggling with it more than others.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.129
This episode, however, is not going to be preachy or to try to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.760
give you any advice about your mental health, of course it isn’t.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.550
Instead, we are going to explore how mental health has been perceived throughout

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.470
history, we’ll talk about mental health today, and look at some of the reasons

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.019
that led a top UN official to declare that we are living in a mental health crisis.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.639
This is also a member request from Hana, so Hana, if

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:06.630
you’re listening, thank you, and I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.320
OK then, A Short History of Mental Health.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.360
If I had to ask you what you thought the oldest

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.710
surgical procedure in the world was, what would you say?

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.270
Perhaps it might be removing a tooth.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.770
Perhaps the amputation of an infected toe.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.020
Perhaps it might be stitching up a wound.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.759
These are all contenders, but let me add one that you might not have thought of.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:45.500
It was a procedure that was thought to be too dangerous and too risky to have been performed by

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.820
anyone apart from the most skilled of doctors, something that barely anyone would have survived.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.449
But when a team of French archaeologists excavated a burial site from 6500 BC, eight and a half

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.430
thousand years ago, they were struck by something strange about the skeletons they found there.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.490
Of the 120 skulls that they found there, 40 had holes in,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.650
holes that had been carefully drilled into the skulls.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.500
This was the first evidence of trepanning, or trephination, a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.810
medical procedure that involved cutting a hole into the skull.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.350
Why might someone do this, you might ask?

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.025
Well, it’s thought that one of the main reasons was that it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.890
was to cure a patient suffering from a mental health issue.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.489
You can, perhaps, understand why a society with a very

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.320
primitive knowledge of the human body thought this.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.160
If you cut your leg, the problem is clear, there is blood, you stop the bleeding and fix the cut.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.209
If you have a rotten tooth, you pull the tooth out.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.459
If there is a visible physical problem, you might not

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.640
know how to fix it, but at least you can see what’s wrong.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.839
But if someone is behaving in an erratic manner, how can this be solved?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.200
Well, perhaps the clue lay somewhere in their head, and by opening it up, perhaps

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.860
whatever was causing the problem would go out and the problem would be solved.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.190
And as you may know, trepanning, the act of drilling a hole into someone’s head, was widespread;

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.810
there is evidence for it all across the world, from South America to China, France to Russia.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.530
Something you might not know, however, is that this practice had advocates as recently

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:59.400
as the 1960s, when a Dutch librarian drilled a hole in his own head as a publicity stunt.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.220
This is just one example of how confusing mental health

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.300
was to medical professionals, and debatably, still is.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.930
For thousands of years, drilling a hole in someone’s skull

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.549
was one way that people tried to “cure” mental health issues.

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:26.120
And, while the advances we have made in most areas of medicine have been

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.940
vast, with most people now able to live longer and healthier lives if they

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.310
so choose, the same progress has not been made in the field of mental health.

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:42.960
And, looking at the number of people who report having experienced

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.290
mental health problems, this is now higher than ever before.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.439
A recent report from the Harvard Medical School estimated that 50% of the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.950
world’s population will experience a mental health issue during their lifetime.

00:05:00.207 --> 00:05:04.077
So, before we dive into the current mental health

00:05:04.127 --> 00:05:07.887
crisis, let’s talk about some history of mental health.

00:05:09.397 --> 00:05:15.867
Fortunately, it isn’t all holes in the head, but there are plenty of equally grisly treatments.

00:05:17.077 --> 00:05:21.607
Given the fact that mental health problems are less visible than physical health

00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:27.757
problems, across cultures and societies, mental health problems were frequently associated

00:05:28.037 --> 00:05:33.937
with some kind of religious defect, someone was possessed by the devil, it was a

00:05:33.977 --> 00:05:41.287
problem between the individual and God, or some kind of moral failing caused by sin.

00:05:42.477 --> 00:05:48.297
Mental health problems were also understood by some physicians to be linked to physical health.

00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:54.987
There was the Hippocratic idea of the four humours, that there are four elements

00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:59.177
of the body that need to be balanced, to maintain physical and mental health.

00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:04.187
Depending on how you felt, both physically and psychologically,

00:06:04.707 --> 00:06:09.087
different actions would be taken to rebalance these four humours.

00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:17.037
Now, this was completely flawed logic, we now know it to be untrue, but the

00:06:17.047 --> 00:06:21.167
shift from considering mental health issues to be some kind of religious

00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:26.407
defect to being a medical condition to be treated was an important one.

00:06:27.597 --> 00:06:32.427
Unfortunately, the “treatments” were pretty horrific.

00:06:33.747 --> 00:06:39.507
If you were declared “insane” or “mad” in England, you might have been sent to a

00:06:39.527 --> 00:06:44.377
so-called “mad house” to live with other people suffering from similar conditions.

00:06:45.407 --> 00:06:49.607
If you were a woman suffering mental health issues, these might be

00:06:49.607 --> 00:06:54.627
interpreted as witchcraft and you might have been burned at the stake.

00:06:55.707 --> 00:07:01.148
You might even have been chained up, with hundreds of other people suffering similar issues,

00:07:01.508 --> 00:07:07.728
and members of the public would be able to pay to come and observe you, like animals in a zoo.

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.588
Life was pretty grim.

00:07:11.688 --> 00:07:16.878
In 1845, the British Parliament passed something called The Lunacy Act,

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:21.518
which officially classified people who were mentally ill as “patients”,

00:07:21.978 --> 00:07:26.264
recognising mental illness as something to be treated as a health condition.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:32.138
They would be sent to “mental asylums” where they would be treated by medical staff.

00:07:33.308 --> 00:07:38.041
Unfortunately, conditions for people in these asylums were not much of an improvement.

00:07:39.135 --> 00:07:43.456
It was, however, the start of an increased interest and more

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:47.856
concentrated research into mental illness and how to treat it.

00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:53.926
Although the intentions might have been good, the results of viewing

00:07:53.926 --> 00:07:58.986
mental illness as a disease to be treated were, in many cases, horrific.

00:07:59.906 --> 00:08:04.906
In the 1950s both lobotomy and electroconvulsive therapy

00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:08.616
were popular “treatments” for a variety of mental illnesses.

00:08:09.886 --> 00:08:16.506
A lobotomy is an invasive treatment where the lobes of part of the brain were severed, cut off.

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:21.596
And electroconvulsive therapy, or electroshock therapy,

00:08:21.886 --> 00:08:24.716
involves sending electrical waves through the brain.

00:08:25.946 --> 00:08:31.376
Nowadays, lobotomies have been completely discredited, seen as being part of a

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:37.596
dark period in psychiatric care, and electroshock therapy is only used in the most

00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:43.456
severe cases, such as imminent suicide, when all other options have been exhausted.

00:08:44.876 --> 00:08:48.996
Now, this brings us more or less to the present day.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:56.226
You heard at the start of the episode that the Harvard Medical School estimated that half of

00:08:56.226 --> 00:09:02.066
the world’s population will experience some form of mental health issue during their lifetime.

00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:08.956
And mental health issues are particularly prevalent among certain demographic groups.

00:09:10.196 --> 00:09:15.576
In the case of the United States, a recent survey shone some interesting light on this,

00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:21.166
on the reported one in five Americans who is currently living with a mental health issue.

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:26.716
Women report suffering from mental health issues more than men, with

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:31.846
27% of American women saying that they have a mental health issue vs.

00:09:32.346 --> 00:09:33.116
18% of men.

00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:39.446
And mental health issues are disproportionately skewed towards the young,

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:46.346
with 34% of Americans aged 18-25 suffering from a mental health issue vs.

00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:55.558
28% of adults aged 26 to 49 and only 15% of those aged fifty and over.

00:09:56.741 --> 00:10:00.241
And there is also an interesting split by race.

00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:06.161
35% of mixed race Americans reported a mental health issue,

00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:12.841
24% of white Americans, and only 16% of Asian Americans.

00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:18.031
So, the million dollar question is…why?

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:21.881
Or actually there are many more than one question.

00:10:22.751 --> 00:10:26.871
Why are so many people living with mental health issues in the modern era

00:10:27.142 --> 00:10:31.022
when people weren’t reporting the same mental health issues 100 years ago?

00:10:31.942 --> 00:10:36.963
Why are so many young people reporting mental health issues compared to older people?

00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:42.893
Why are women 50% more likely than men to report having a mental health issue?

00:10:43.913 --> 00:10:48.183
In the US at least, why are there more than twice as many mixed

00:10:48.183 --> 00:10:52.163
race people reporting mental health issues as Asian Americans?

00:10:53.403 --> 00:10:58.003
One theory that proposes an answer to all of these questions, in fact,

00:10:58.333 --> 00:11:02.403
is to do with the social stigma around talking about mental health.

00:11:03.743 --> 00:11:08.063
100 years ago, if you thought you might be put in a lunatic asylum

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:10.663
for telling someone you were struggling with your mental health,

00:11:11.323 --> 00:11:16.093
you would probably just keep quiet about it and suffer in silence.

00:11:17.503 --> 00:11:24.773
Similarly, as discussion of mental health is something relatively recent, it’s natural that younger

00:11:24.773 --> 00:11:30.073
people are more willing to talk about it and admit that they have a problem than older people.

00:11:31.263 --> 00:11:35.463
And to answer the question of why mental health problems are so low

00:11:35.663 --> 00:11:40.163
with Asian Americans, there is a particular stigma around talking about

00:11:40.163 --> 00:11:44.963
mental health in Asian communities, so, again, people suffer in silence.

00:11:46.253 --> 00:11:51.023
And of course, the same thing goes with men compared to women; there is more

00:11:51.063 --> 00:11:56.653
stigma for a man talking about his mental health than a woman talking about her’s.

00:11:57.363 --> 00:11:59.293
Or that’s one theory at least.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:06.283
Now, it’s clear that more people report suffering from mental health problems than ever before,

00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:13.033
but as to the question of whether this is actually because more people are suffering from mental

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:18.463
health issues than ever before, or it’s only because more people are admitting that they are

00:12:18.463 --> 00:12:23.983
suffering from mental health issues, this is another very interesting and divisive question.

00:12:24.486 --> 00:12:29.285
In other words, did just as many people suffer from mental health problems

00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:35.185
500 or 1,000 years ago, but because people didn’t talk about it, most

00:12:35.195 --> 00:12:39.613
people suffered in silence, and only the most extreme cases were reported?

00:12:40.812 --> 00:12:47.032
Life in the 21st century is easier in many ways than it has ever been before.

00:12:47.812 --> 00:12:52.792
We have machines that do most things for us, we don’t have to worry about being attacked

00:12:52.802 --> 00:12:57.842
by Vikings or dying from the plague or our children having to work in coal mines.

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:04.102
But more people are living alone, there is the constant pressure to compare

00:13:04.102 --> 00:13:09.312
yourself to others, people are more individualistic than ever before.

00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:15.452
Life is, in many ways, more complicated than at any other time in history.

00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:20.502
So, perhaps, yes, these are all factors that have meant

00:13:20.502 --> 00:13:23.792
that people are more likely to develop mental health issues.

00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:28.952
And these simply weren’t factors that existed 100 years ago; people

00:13:28.962 --> 00:13:32.962
had different, some might say more important, things to worry about.

00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:39.282
But, on the other side of the argument, there are those who say that there really

00:13:39.322 --> 00:13:44.382
aren’t any more people suffering from mental health issues than ever before, but we have

00:13:44.402 --> 00:13:50.522
enlarged the category of mental health and have created a crisis where there is none.

00:13:51.822 --> 00:13:58.252
Pharmaceutical companies, so the argument goes, have seen a golden opportunity to treat “mental

00:13:58.262 --> 00:14:04.192
health” issues with expensive drugs, and this has led to a boom in people who are looking for

00:14:04.192 --> 00:14:09.432
quick, pharmaceutical, treatments to problems that they would have historically solved on their own.

00:14:10.752 --> 00:14:16.062
And, to continue the sceptic's view, it is completely natural and human for

00:14:16.062 --> 00:14:21.304
people’s moods to change, to feel better some days and worse the others, and so

00:14:21.304 --> 00:14:26.200
to encourage everyone to start viewing this as a health issue is to trivialise

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:30.730
people who are suffering from real, more serious, mental health issues.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:38.730
To reiterate, this is not to belittle or cast judgement on anyone’s experience with their own mental

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:45.250
health, but rather to explore both sides of what’s clearly a complicated and nuanced argument.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:51.250
Now,  to finish off this exploration of mental health I want to leave you

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.160
with a quote from the great French philosopher and historian, Michel Foucault.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.470
I like this quote for two reasons.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:06.450
Firstly because it comes from Foucault’s seminal work, Madness and Civilization: A History

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:11.550
of Insanity in the Age of Reason, which is an amazing history of mental health over time,

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.290
and one I would highly recommend for you to read if you can get your hands on a copy.

00:15:16.834 --> 00:15:20.934
And secondly, from an English language perspective, it is a

00:15:21.014 --> 00:15:25.904
complicated grammatical sentence that consists of very simple words.

00:15:26.764 --> 00:15:34.504
So, here you go, I'll say it slowly: "People know what they do; frequently they

00:15:34.504 --> 00:15:43.924
know why they do what they do; but what they don't know is what what they do does"

00:15:46.234 --> 00:15:50.514
OK then, that is it for today's episode on mental health.

00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:54.064
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:15:54.694 --> 00:15:57.704
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:15:58.224 --> 00:16:00.644
Do you think there is a global mental health crisis?

00:16:01.034 --> 00:16:05.104
What are some of the reasons behind it, and what are some of the solutions?

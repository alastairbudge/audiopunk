Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to

00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:11.511
English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:14.931
The show where you can learn fascinating things about

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:18.801
the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:20.631
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:24.721
Alastair Budge: Today, we are going to be talking about

00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:28.531
a shop, Alastair Budge: but it is more than a shop.

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.791
Alastair Budge: It's an institution with a fascinating history.

00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.521
Alastair Budge: We'll discover how a little shop that started in London's poor

00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:45.841
East End grew and grew and became the playground of the rich and famous and how

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:52.861
queens, princes, prime ministers and even entire countries got caught up with it.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:57.376
That's right, today we are going to be talking about one

00:00:57.376 --> 00:01:01.996
of the most famous department stores in the world, Harrods.

00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:06.699
Alastair Budge: Before we get right into it though, this is just my chance

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:12.489
to remind you that you can get all of the bonus podcasts, plus transcripts,

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:17.579
key vocabulary, and more over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:18.234 --> 00:01:23.064
We're now releasing one episode a week for everyone, but two episodes

00:01:23.064 --> 00:01:27.264
a week to our growing community, our members of curious minds.

00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:31.014
So if you want to find out more about that, and I

00:01:31.014 --> 00:01:34.804
really hope you do, then head to Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:41.064
Okay then without further ado, let's talk about Harrods.

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:46.624
For those of you that have been to London, I imagine that

00:01:46.624 --> 00:01:50.494
you might have been to Harrods or at least walked past it.

00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:54.814
And for those of you that have never been, perhaps you

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:59.464
have heard of it, or at least you might recognise the logo.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.710
Alastair Budge: It is one of the world's largest department stores

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.195
covering 1.1 million square feet, which is about 14 football pitches.

00:02:11.357 --> 00:02:16.157
Alastair Budge: It is located in a very fancy, upmarket area of London,

00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:20.817
Alastair Budge: Knightsbridge, which is one of the most expensive areas in London.

00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:27.408
Alastair Budge: But the story of how Harrods came to be, of how it became

00:02:27.438 --> 00:02:32.158
this huge luxury department store Alastair Budge: is pretty interesting.

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:42.128
And as with lots of things that we now take for granted, it has humble beginnings, it started small.

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.162
Alastair Budge: Our story starts back in the year 1824,

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:52.577
with a 25 year old man called Charles Henry Harrod.

00:02:54.297 --> 00:03:01.857
He had started various small shops selling cloth and groceries in south and east London.

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:11.737
For almost 25 years, Charles Henry Harrod ran these small businesses happily enough, but

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:17.572
they were nothing spectacular, at least in Alastair Budge: terms of business success.

00:03:19.362 --> 00:03:25.132
Harrod himself had a quite colourful life and it's fair to

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:29.902
say that he engaged in a few not completely legal activities.

00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:37.082
He was caught by the police receiving stolen goods, and was almost

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:43.732
deported to Australia as was common for criminals in Britain at that time.

00:03:45.452 --> 00:03:51.452
He narrowly escaped this punishment after numerous colleagues and employees

00:03:51.672 --> 00:03:57.902
petitioned, they complained on his behalf, saying that he was actually of excellent

00:03:57.902 --> 00:04:02.642
character and he didn't deserve to be sent to the other side of the world.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.927
Alastair Budge: Luckily for him, the appeals were accepted and he was only made

00:04:09.957 --> 00:04:14.887
to spend a year in a London prison, he wasn't sent all the way to Australia.

00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:25.357
Then in 1849, Alastair Budge: 25 years after starting, the fate of Harrods changed.

00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:33.086
London was rapidly expanding to the west Alastair Budge: and Harrod decided

00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:39.426
to move his shop to an area of London called Brompton, near Hyde Park.

00:04:40.956 --> 00:04:47.646
Even though this is very much in central London now, 150 years ago,

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:51.936
it was pretty far from the centre, which was further to the east.

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:56.721
Alastair Budge: So this was a bit of a speculative move, a bit of a gamble.

00:04:58.054 --> 00:05:02.374
Alastair Budge: The rationale, the reason for moving the shop was that

00:05:02.374 --> 00:05:08.524
London was expanding and 1851 was the year of the Great Exhibition.

00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.061
Alastair Budge: Harrod thought that he could be in a good location

00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:16.171
for the crowds going to the exhibition, Alastair Budge: which was

00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:19.681
in Hyde Park, Alastair Budge: the park next to his chosen location.

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:24.208
Alastair Budge: It proved to be an excellent move, and

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:28.678
the trajectory of Harrods was changed for the better.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:35.238
Shortly after this move, the original founder, Charles Henry

00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:40.743
Harrod passed on the business to his son, Charles Digby Harrod.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:49.263
The son, Charles Digby, was much more innovative than his father and under his

00:05:49.263 --> 00:05:57.753
direction, the store grew and grew, eventually employing a hundred people by 1881.

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:05.943
It had also branched out, by this time it had expanded the products that

00:06:05.943 --> 00:06:12.123
it was selling into, medicine, Alastair Budge: perfume, groceries, and

00:06:12.123 --> 00:06:17.493
much more from this one shop, which was quite a novelty at the time.

00:06:19.683 --> 00:06:27.723
Also, far from being a luxury store, catering for those with deep pockets, it

00:06:27.723 --> 00:06:34.158
was originally a quite low price shop, but it did have an emphasis on quality.

00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:40.388
Alastair Budge: Its motto, its slogan, was 'Omnia Omnibus Ubique',

00:06:41.198 --> 00:06:45.638
which is Latin for all things, for all people, everywhere.

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:50.976
Alastair Budge: That is, I should say, still the slogan of Harrods.

00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:55.536
However, if you go in there now and look at the price tags,

00:06:55.896 --> 00:06:59.366
I think you might debate how applicable that slogan still is.

00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:04.962
Alastair Budge: But it wasn't plain sailing for Harrods, it wasn't

00:07:05.142 --> 00:07:10.212
a straightforward rise to the top, to the status that it now has.

00:07:11.582 --> 00:07:19.472
The story of Harrods almost came to a crashing end just a few years later, in

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:26.222
1883, when the whole store burned to the ground, it was completely destroyed.

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:32.042
To make matters worse, this happened just before

00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:35.912
Christmas, the busiest time of the year for Harrods.

00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:41.417
So it was suddenly left with a building burnt to the ground,

00:07:41.867 --> 00:07:46.997
but still needing to fulfill thousands of orders for Christmas.

00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:53.571
Alastair Budge: Rather than apologising and telling his customers that

00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:58.111
unfortunately, their Christmas order was canceled that year, Harrod

00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:04.111
insisted that every single one was fulfilled, every order was honoured.

00:08:05.106 --> 00:08:06.216
And he did it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.330
Alastair Budge: After this Harrods gained a name for reliability and quality, and it

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:20.396
soon became a favourite Alastair Budge: of high class Londoners, including names you

00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:25.443
would probably recognise people like Oscar Wilde, Alastair Budge: Charlie Chaplin,

00:08:25.786 --> 00:08:30.506
Alastair Budge: Sigmund Freud, Alastair Budge: and a large part of the British Royal family.

00:08:32.716 --> 00:08:39.436
It also became a place where various new technological developments were shown off to the public.

00:08:41.076 --> 00:08:45.126
One of my favourite stories about Harrods is that it was

00:08:45.126 --> 00:08:50.256
the place where the first escalator was installed in 1898.

00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:57.191
Alastair Budge: Now to you or me going on an escalator might just seem like

00:08:57.191 --> 00:09:03.011
a pretty normal thing, nothing to be worried about, and we're just used to

00:09:03.011 --> 00:09:08.201
them being an easier way of going up or down levels, as opposed to stairs.

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:15.239
Alastair Budge: But if you try to put yourself in the shoes of someone in 1898 who

00:09:15.239 --> 00:09:21.549
had never seen an escalator before, you can imagine it might have seemed quite scary.

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:29.229
Harrods knew that it might be a bit scary for their customers, and so they had

00:09:29.229 --> 00:09:35.889
someone at the top of the escalator who offered a glass of brandy to people

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:40.989
who had come up as a way of helping them recover and regain their nerves.

00:09:41.859 --> 00:09:42.939
Quite something, right?

00:09:44.403 --> 00:09:49.072
Alastair Budge: Harrods cemented its reputation as a British institution

00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:56.122
in the first half of the 20th century, even switching from upmarket premium

00:09:56.122 --> 00:10:01.912
department store to making uniforms and parachutes during World War II.

00:10:03.172 --> 00:10:08.660
Alastair Budge: It also changed hands several times, it was bought and sold several times.

00:10:09.185 --> 00:10:15.335
But it was in 1985 when our story really starts to get interesting

00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:20.171
again Alastair Budge: as it was bought by the Egyptian Mohamed Al-Fayed.

00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:27.811
Alastair Budge: Now, Al-Fayed was, and still is, I should say, a larger than life character.

00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:29.941
He is anything but boring.

00:10:31.511 --> 00:10:37.031
He is an Egyptian and had accumulated a large amount of money through

00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:43.561
slightly opaque business dealings in Egypt, the middle East and Haiti.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.370
Alastair Budge: He had made a lot of money and he bought the

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:54.760
Ritz in Paris in 1979, and then turned his attention to Harrods.

00:10:55.976 --> 00:10:59.686
Alastair Budge: It was claimed when he bought Harrods that in fact

00:10:59.746 --> 00:11:04.756
he had lied about his wealth, about how much money he had, and that

00:11:04.756 --> 00:11:09.586
he had faked various pieces of information about his background.

00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:14.261
Maybe he wasn't as rich as he had told everyone he was.

00:11:16.221 --> 00:11:19.921
Also, he was known as Mohamed Al-Fayed, Alastair Budge:

00:11:19.921 --> 00:11:24.231
but his name at birth was actually just Mohamed Fayed.

00:11:24.921 --> 00:11:28.281
He adopted the 'Al' when he was around 45.

00:11:30.258 --> 00:11:34.758
Alastair Budge: People have assumed that he added this 'Al' to his name

00:11:35.088 --> 00:11:39.629
to make him sound more Alastair Budge: aristocratic, of better background,

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:45.939
similar to how in French, you might have 'de' something or in German 'von'.

00:11:46.979 --> 00:11:52.949
Alastair Budge: But interestingly enough, 'Al' doesn't have the same connotations in Arabic.

00:11:54.229 --> 00:12:00.319
So one famous British satirical magazine called Private Eye decided

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:06.309
to refer to Al-Fayed as the phony Pharaoh, the fake pharoah.

00:12:07.679 --> 00:12:13.132
Alastair Budge: With Al-Fayed as the owner of Harrods things certainly became more interesting.

00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:20.512
He installed a large Egyptian room in Harrods Alastair Budge: with pictures of himself.

00:12:21.652 --> 00:12:24.532
Alastair Budge: He also dragged Harrods into some strange

00:12:24.562 --> 00:12:29.872
controversies and strange areas that it had never experienced before.

00:12:31.978 --> 00:12:38.578
Alastair Budge: Firstly, Al-Fayed was very protective of the Harrods name and the Harrods brand.

00:12:39.918 --> 00:12:46.278
So much so that anyone who used a name that was in any way similar was considered a

00:12:46.278 --> 00:12:51.392
threat, Alastair Budge: no matter if they had nothing at all to do with Harrods in London.

00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:59.422
In 1986, for example, Al-Fayed launched a lawsuit against a

00:12:59.422 --> 00:13:04.967
small restaurant in New Zealand run by a man called Henry Harrod.

00:13:06.712 --> 00:13:11.632
That restaurant was called Harrods, and Al-Fayed wasn't happy that

00:13:11.632 --> 00:13:16.162
there were two Harrods in the world, despite them being on completely

00:13:16.162 --> 00:13:19.822
different sides of the world and doing very different things.

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:25.837
Alastair Budge: Unfortunately for Al-Fayed, the entire town that Harrods

00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:30.504
New Zealand was in decided to support the local businessman, Alastair Budge:

00:13:30.504 --> 00:13:35.702
proposing that every single business in the town change its name to Harrods.

00:13:36.122 --> 00:13:43.002
And even the town, which is called Otorohanga, change its name to Harrodsville,

00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:48.192
just to support the local restaurant, and of course to annoy Al-Fayed.

00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:54.176
Alastair Budge: This pressure worked and Al-Fayed dropped the charges.

00:13:55.249 --> 00:13:59.400
Alastair Budge: As you might imagine, the local businesses also decided not

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:04.080
to change their name, and the town also decided to keep its original name.

00:14:06.113 --> 00:14:10.343
Alastair Budge: Secondly, there was something called the cash for questions scandal.

00:14:11.006 --> 00:14:15.942
Alastair Budge: Al-Fayed said that he had paid two MPs, two members

00:14:15.942 --> 00:14:20.682
of parliament, to ask questions for him in the British parliament.

00:14:22.482 --> 00:14:26.472
While there was nothing actually technically illegal about this,

00:14:26.968 --> 00:14:29.608
Alastair Budge: the MPs should have declared that they did it.

00:14:30.178 --> 00:14:31.468
Instead, they didn't.

00:14:32.418 --> 00:14:35.502
Alastair Budge: There was a big, big scandal involving the prime

00:14:35.502 --> 00:14:41.362
minister and now Harrods, which was intrinsically linked to Al-Fayed.

00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:45.701
Alastair Budge: And finally was an event that I'm sure you

00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:52.091
have heard of, the death of Princess Diana in 1997 in Paris.

00:14:53.966 --> 00:14:57.866
Now, Princess Diana, in case you need a reminder, she was

00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:02.396
the wife of Prince Charles, the son of the queen of England.

00:15:03.716 --> 00:15:10.436
They divorced after an unhappy marriage, and Diana started dating a man called Dodi,

00:15:11.036 --> 00:15:15.605
Dodi Al-Fayed, Alastair Budge: the son of Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods.

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:21.403
Alastair Budge: Dodi was in the car with Diana and they both died in the car crash.

00:15:22.536 --> 00:15:25.883
Alastair Budge: Mohamed Al-Fayed, understandably was traumatised.

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:27.943
He had lost his son.

00:15:29.503 --> 00:15:34.190
But rather than Alastair Budge: mourning in Alastair Budge: private Alastair Budge: he waged a

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:40.320
personal war against the Royal family, Alastair Budge: claiming that they had murdered his son.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:45.750
He said that Prince Phillip, Alastair Budge: the husband of Queen Elizabeth

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:53.454
Alastair Budge: had conspired with MI6 the British secret service to murder Dodi and Diana.

00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:59.113
Alastair Budge: Despite there being no real strong evidence that this was

00:15:59.113 --> 00:16:05.203
what actually happened, Al-Fayed was having none of it, he was at war with

00:16:05.203 --> 00:16:09.943
the British Royal family and this put Harrods in a difficult position.

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:15.697
Alastair Budge: Harrods had previously held something called a Royal warrant,

00:16:16.327 --> 00:16:21.487
which is something that probably seems strange to anyone who isn't British.

00:16:22.117 --> 00:16:26.887
And even if you're British, and think about it for a minute, it is still pretty strange.

00:16:28.367 --> 00:16:33.617
A Royal warrant means that you have the right to provide goods or services

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:38.267
to the Royal family, and you can advertise the fact that you do this.

00:16:39.717 --> 00:16:43.767
It's seen as almost the ultimate stamp of quality.

00:16:44.457 --> 00:16:50.817
The unwritten meaning being that if it's good enough for the queen, it's good enough for me.

00:16:52.447 --> 00:16:59.337
Anyway, Harrods had several of these Royal warrants Alastair Budge: and had held them since 1910.

00:17:01.247 --> 00:17:08.217
Al-Fayed, furious with the Royal family after losing his son, took down the Royal warrants

00:17:08.307 --> 00:17:13.818
from the department store and later revealed Alastair Budge: that he had burnt them.

00:17:14.118 --> 00:17:16.638
He'd destroyed the Royal warrants.

00:17:17.782 --> 00:17:22.192
Alastair Budge: In 2010 Al-Fayed decided that enough was enough.

00:17:22.582 --> 00:17:28.042
He had owned the store for 25 years and he got an offer he couldn't refuse,

00:17:28.732 --> 00:17:34.717
actually from the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, for one and a half billion pounds.

00:17:35.586 --> 00:17:38.335
Alastair Budge: And that that was it, that particular era of

00:17:38.335 --> 00:17:44.035
Harrods ended, its new owner is ultimately Qatar, the country.

00:17:45.188 --> 00:17:49.770
Alastair Budge: Harrods now is still a massive business with hundreds

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:56.160
of thousands of visitors every day, at least in pre Covid times.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.980
And it is a pretty surreal place.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:07.310
So let's just finish this episode with three of the strangest facts and stories about Harrods.

00:18:08.836 --> 00:18:15.626
Alastair Budge: Firstly, until 2014 in addition to clothes, food, jewellery,

00:18:15.646 --> 00:18:21.286
perfume, and hundreds of other things, Harrods sold exotic animals.

00:18:22.366 --> 00:18:29.956
It had a famous pet department where you could buy things like lions, tigers and panthers.

00:18:30.975 --> 00:18:35.355
Alastair Budge: There is a really cute film actually called Christian the Lion, which

00:18:35.355 --> 00:18:40.425
tells the story of a lion that was bought in Harrods and then released into the wild.

00:18:40.725 --> 00:18:43.725
Alastair Budge: Just search for Christian the lion in YouTube, and you'll find it.

00:18:44.983 --> 00:18:50.173
Alastair Budge: Thankfully, Harrods has now stopped its policy of selling exotic

00:18:50.173 --> 00:18:56.863
animals, although it does continue to sell lots of exotic stuff at sky high prices.

00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:01.379
Alastair Budge: And this leads us onto our next weird story.

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:09.649
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Harrods comes up a lot in stories about lavish

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:15.134
spending by some slightly Alastair Budge: dodgy and disreputable individuals.

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:22.517
Alastair Budge: A lady called Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of an Azerbaijani banker who is

00:19:22.517 --> 00:19:29.522
at the centre of a money laundering case in London, was asked to explain where she got

00:19:29.522 --> 00:19:38.032
the money to spend 16 million pounds at Harrods over the course of 10 years, including

00:19:38.572 --> 00:19:48.752
£24,000 on tea and coffee, £10,000 on fruit and vegetables, and £32,000 on chocolates.

00:19:50.063 --> 00:19:59.963
Alastair Budge: And on 11 different occasions, she spent over £250,000 in one single day at Harrods.

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:03.187
Alastair Budge: If you are wondering, she doesn't really

00:20:03.187 --> 00:20:05.857
have a good explanation about where she got the money.

00:20:08.267 --> 00:20:14.567
And Harrods also got into the news because Asma al-Assad, the wife of the Syrian

00:20:14.597 --> 00:20:22.287
leader was a famous Harrods customer, once spending £10,000 just on candlesticks.

00:20:23.707 --> 00:20:26.497
Alastair Budge: So they've got some slightly dodgy clients.

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:30.321
Alastair Budge: However, these dodgy clients do spend quite a lot of money.

00:20:32.571 --> 00:20:41.496
And one final quite funny story, which I think is actually quite telling is about a hoodie that was

00:20:41.496 --> 00:20:51.186
put on sale in Harrods at the hefty price of £680, which was almost a thousand dollars at the time.

00:20:52.536 --> 00:20:55.596
Alastair Budge: So a hoodie, just in case you don't know what it is,

00:20:55.926 --> 00:21:01.926
it is a sweater, a pullover, a jumper with a hood on it, the kind of

00:21:01.926 --> 00:21:07.236
thing you could buy in a normal shop for £20, let's say, or even less.

00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:10.991
Alastair Budge: So, what was so special about this hoodie, you

00:21:10.991 --> 00:21:15.171
might ask, the £680 hoodie that you could get from Harrods?

00:21:16.021 --> 00:21:17.551
Well, nothing really.

00:21:17.971 --> 00:21:24.841
It was just black and it had some letters on the front in Cyrillic, in the Russian alphabet.

00:21:25.858 --> 00:21:31.348
Alastair Budge: When it was shared on Twitter, some helpful Russians pointed out that

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:36.898
it actually said, and you'll have to excuse my language here, it said, go fuck yourself.

00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:42.090
Alastair Budge: When this was revealed, it was swiftly removed from sale by Harrods.

00:21:43.825 --> 00:21:48.355
So there are lots of things that money can buy you, but class

00:21:48.385 --> 00:21:51.325
and style, unfortunately doesn't seem to be one of them.

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:58.885
Okay then that is it for today's episode on Harrods.

00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:00.385
I hope it was a fun one.

00:22:01.284 --> 00:22:04.734
Alastair Budge: If you do get the chance to go to London whenever that might

00:22:04.734 --> 00:22:10.764
be, it certainly is worth a visit at least to poke your nose in to Harrods.

00:22:11.709 --> 00:22:16.329
It's a fascinating place, has a very interesting history as we found

00:22:16.329 --> 00:22:19.869
out, and don't worry, you definitely don't need to buy anything.

00:22:21.009 --> 00:22:26.049
Just have a wander around knowing that you probably now know more about

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:30.639

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.079
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.170
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.810
about the famous Egyptian queen, Cleopatra the Seventh.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.000
She died over 2,000 years ago, and didn’t even live long enough to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.550
see her 40th birthday, but she led a simply fascinating life and left

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.870
a legacy that continues to intrigue and fascinate to this very day.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.839
So let’s not waste a minute, and talk about Cleopatra.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:58.989
For practically all of human history, and in many countries to this very day, women have

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.170
had it pretty tough, treated as second class citizens compared to their male counterparts.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.360
Limited access to education, limited employment opportunities, forced to marry someone they might

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:19.800
despise, faced with the possibility of dying during childbirth, and treated as inferior to men.

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:25.664
And even for women throughout history who have clearly been far more talented and

00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:30.674
intelligent than the men around them, they are often reduced to their femininity,

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:36.164
their womanhood, portrayed as a temptress to innocent and honourable men.

00:01:36.984 --> 00:01:40.884
We spoke about this in a mini-series last year, on Anne Boleyn,

00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:44.464
Catherine The Great of Russia, and Elizabeth the First of England.

00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:51.154
But there is perhaps no greater example of an immensely talented woman who history has

00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:57.214
reduced to her sexuality than the subject of today’s episode, Cleopatra VII of Egypt.

00:01:58.004 --> 00:02:04.174
In much of popular culture, she is thought of as a supporting actor to the goings on of

00:02:04.274 --> 00:02:10.834
Ancient Rome, and as a temptress that seduced powerful men with nothing more than her beauty.

00:02:11.174 --> 00:02:16.040
Or to quote the French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal, “had

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.074
Cleopatra’s nose been shorter, the whole face of the world would have been changed”

00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:26.294
As we’ll see, there is much more to her than her physical appearance.

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:31.894
There’s also much more to her than her relationship with Rome, but we cannot

00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:36.374
tell the story of Cleopatra without also understanding a bit of what was

00:02:36.384 --> 00:02:41.224
going on in Ancient Rome, and in the Mediterranean at the time of her rule.

00:02:42.464 --> 00:02:46.784
In fact, we need to go back a few hundred years to get a proper understanding.

00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:56.124
When Alexander The Great conquered Egypt in 332 BC, he established a city in his name, Alexandria.

00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:00.894
After his death, his empire was divided among his generals,

00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:05.904
and one of his favourite generals, Ptolemy I, was given Egypt.

00:03:06.754 --> 00:03:13.664
Ptolemy became an Egyptian pharaoh, and the Ptolemaic dynasty lasted for almost 300 years.

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:19.364
During this period, its capital, Alexandria, became a great centre

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:24.724
for science, technology, philosophy and mathematics, it was one

00:03:24.724 --> 00:03:29.604
of, if not the, world’s centre of science and culture at the time.

00:03:30.674 --> 00:03:38.014
And this was the environment in which Cleopatra was born, in early 69 or late 70 BC.

00:03:39.244 --> 00:03:44.286
She would have received the best education in the world, learning mathematics,

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:50.346
philosophy, and reasoning, and by all accounts she was a remarkable young woman.

00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:53.946
She was also a talented linguist.

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:57.416
Her mother tongue would have been Greek, but she

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:01.166
spoke 10 languages, including the Egyptian language.

00:04:02.306 --> 00:04:05.956
Now, you might think, “of course she would speak Egyptian, she

00:04:05.956 --> 00:04:10.306
was the queen of Egypt”, but this wasn’t actually that obvious.

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:16.116
The Ptolemaic kings that came before her refused to learn Egyptian, and

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:20.706
ruled the country as a Greek state, essentially, having a lot of fun

00:04:20.706 --> 00:04:25.186
and partying but not really engaging at all with the people of Egypt.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:29.836
Cleopatra would be different, as we’ll see in a minute.

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.376
Anyway, back to our story.

00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:39.866
Cleopatra’s early life, indeed her entire life, was characterised by political instability,

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:45.566
infighting and disputes going on on the other side of the Mediterranean, in Rome.

00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:53.116
This episode would literally go on for days if we were to go into all of them in detail, so

00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:58.296
you will forgive me for skipping over some of the details to focus more on Cleopatra herself.

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:06.486
Her father died when she was around 11 years old, and in his will he specified that

00:05:06.486 --> 00:05:13.406
Cleopatra and her brother, Ptolemy XIII, should get married and be joint rulers.

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:20.776
This might sound unusual to us, but it was the Ptolemaic tradition for

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:25.796
siblings to marry and have children, so that the royal blood was “pure”.

00:05:27.256 --> 00:05:33.626
The problem was, in Cleopatra’s case, that she didn’t really get on with her brother, plus she

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:41.536
was far more talented than he was, and this sibling rivalry culminated in a full scale civil war.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:48.206
Shortly before this, there was also civil unrest on the other side of the Mediterranean.

00:05:48.936 --> 00:05:54.796
Rome was split into two factions: that of Julius Caesar and that of Pompey.

00:05:56.206 --> 00:06:01.626
After a decisive battle in Greece, The Battle of Pharsalus, where Pompey’s forces were

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:08.416
defeated, Pompey was forced to flee to Egypt, where he thought he would be welcomed with

00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:15.086
open arms, as he had been an ally of Cleopatra and Ptolemy XIII’s father, Ptolemy XII.

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:21.556
He wasn’t, and shortly after his arrival he was ambushed and

00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:25.976
killed on the orders of Ptolemy XIII, of Cleopatra’s brother.

00:06:26.806 --> 00:06:32.066
When Caesar arrived in Alexandria shortly after, Ptolemy presented him

00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:36.666
with the severed head of his rival, assuming that he would be pleased.

00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:39.256
But he wasn’t.

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:44.106
Pompey might have been his rival, but Caesar didn’t want a

00:06:44.106 --> 00:06:48.346
renegade Egyptian boy pharaoh taking matters into his own hands.

00:06:49.136 --> 00:06:52.476
Now, I know that’s a lot of detail, and quite a few

00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:56.966
Ptolemies to take in, but we are now at the exciting part.

00:06:57.586 --> 00:07:01.206
It is autumn of 48 BC, in Alexandria.

00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:09.046
Caesar has arrived, the most powerful man in Rome, and he is in the royal palace, surrounded

00:07:09.256 --> 00:07:16.106
by forces loyal to Ptolemy XIII, Cleopatra’s brother, who is plotting to get rid of his sister.

00:07:17.616 --> 00:07:21.806
Cleopatra wasn’t actually in the city at the time, but

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:25.826
she knew that she needed to go in and talk to Caesar.

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:30.616
She couldn’t very well knock on the door and request a formal

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:33.996
meeting; this would come to her brother’s attention immediately.

00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:39.416
Legend has it that she wrapped herself up in a carpet, and was

00:07:39.486 --> 00:07:44.736
smuggled into the palace, where she found the then 52-year-old Caesar.

00:07:46.046 --> 00:07:52.516
She had heard that the Roman was not exactly impervious to female charms, or to put

00:07:52.516 --> 00:07:57.726
it more bluntly, that he was known to sleep with anyone he could, and she rightfully

00:07:57.736 --> 00:08:03.036
thought that he could be a useful ally at a dangerous time for the young queen.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:10.096
After all, he was the most powerful man in Rome, perhaps even in the world at that time,

00:08:10.486 --> 00:08:16.816
and with his help she could get rid of her pesky little brother and secure her rule.

00:08:17.906 --> 00:08:24.776
So, in she came, reportedly wrapped up in a carpet, or camouflaged in a laundry basket.

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.636
In any case, unannounced.

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:31.826
The 21-year-old Egyptian queen presented herself to

00:08:31.826 --> 00:08:36.206
Caesar and he was immediately drawn in by her charm.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:42.436
But this wasn’t, reportedly, merely that she was a beautiful woman.

00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:49.091
It was because she was a fascinating person, a great conversationalist, supremely intelligent,

00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:55.541
and someone the Roman clearly felt an immediate connection with and attraction for.

00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:02.781
We have no record of what Cleopatra felt for Caesar, but the two quickly

00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:07.491
became lovers and allies, with Caesar supporting her against her brother.

00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:13.781
Caesar attempted to negotiate a settlement with Ptolemy XIII, allowing

00:09:13.781 --> 00:09:18.211
for Cleopatra and Ptolemy to rule jointly, but it was rejected.

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:25.601
Ptolemy raised an army and laid the palace to siege, with Caesar and Cleopatra inside it.

00:09:27.131 --> 00:09:29.741
This turned out to be a bad idea.

00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:36.161
It brought Cleopatra and Caesar yet closer together, and by the time Caesar’s reinforcements

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:43.161
arrived, they managed to overpower Ptolemy’s forces and Cleopatra’s brother drowned in The Nile.

00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:49.261
With her brother out of the picture, the Egyptian throne was Cleopatra’s, and

00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:56.601
in 48BC, when she was 21 years old, she became de facto sole ruler of Egypt.

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:02.371
In fact, Cleopatra did have another younger brother, who became

00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:05.591
co-ruler with his sister, as per the Ptolemaic tradition.

00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:12.851
But he only ruled in name, and when he died in mysterious circumstances, thought to

00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:18.431
have been poisoned by his sister, the throne became Cleoptra’s and Cleopatra’s alone.

00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:23.451
And by all accounts, she was an excellent ruler.

00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:28.411
She spent her days reading and responding to letters from officials, she was

00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:33.171
attentive to the needs of her subjects, she was a popular and effective queen.

00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:39.591
Shortly after she became queen, she had a child, the father now widely

00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:43.831
believed to be Caesar, although he did not publicly acknowledge the boy.

00:10:45.191 --> 00:10:52.671
For a few years, the going was good, but on the 15th of March 44 BC, something happened

00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:58.301
that really put a spanner in the works for Cleopatra, it got in the way of her plans.

00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:05.961
Caesar was assassinated, stabbed 23 times by his fellow Roman senators.

00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:12.171
What followed, at least as far as Cleopatra is concerned, was the splitting of Rome

00:11:12.341 --> 00:11:18.971
into several factions, first Caesar’s allies against his assassins, and then when the

00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:24.781
assassins were defeated, the rivalry between Caesar’s allies descended into full out war.

00:11:26.231 --> 00:11:31.301
On one side was Octavian, Caesar’s grandnephew and adopted

00:11:31.301 --> 00:11:34.491
son, who controlled much of the western Roman empire.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.981
Octavian would later become known as Augustus, but we will call

00:11:39.981 --> 00:11:43.471
him Octavian for the rest of the episode, for the sake of ease.

00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:50.401
And on the other side, initially Octavian’s ally but later his rival, was

00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:55.261
Marc Antony, Julius Caesar’s trusted lieutenant, who controlled the East.

00:11:56.721 --> 00:12:00.111
This put Cleopatra in a difficult position.

00:12:01.081 --> 00:12:08.231
Egypt was essentially a client state of Rome so she had to tread carefully and play her cards right.

00:12:09.726 --> 00:12:16.531
Marc Antony summoned Cleopatra to a meeting, which historians now believe was with the express

00:12:16.561 --> 00:12:23.311
intention of inheriting the alliance she had previously had with Julius Caesar, and perhaps more…

00:12:24.699 --> 00:12:31.289
Like Caesar before him, Marc Antony was a powerful man who had had a series of lovers,

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:37.759
and it seems probable that he wanted to add an Egyptian queen to his list of conquests.

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:42.609
After initially ignoring his requests, Cleopatra

00:12:42.849 --> 00:12:48.288
agreed to come, and she arrived in the summer of 41 BC.

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:54.987
The arrival has gone down in history, with Cleopatra arriving not in

00:12:54.987 --> 00:13:00.577
a warship, but a boat filled with purple flowers and perfumed sails.

00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:06.047
And when she arrived, she refused to get off the boat,

00:13:06.527 --> 00:13:10.867
forcing the Roman general to come to her, not vice versa.

00:13:12.237 --> 00:13:17.037
Sure enough, the pair did become lovers, but historians believe

00:13:17.037 --> 00:13:20.821
this to have been a carefully calculated move on Cleopatra’s part.

00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:27.207
Marc Antony was one of if not the most powerful men in Rome after

00:13:27.207 --> 00:13:32.317
Caesar’s death, and he would be an enviable ally for the Egyptian queen.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:41.030
Cleopatra at this time was not even 30 years old, but had shown herself to have a well-honed

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:47.210
understanding of politics, and how to navigate the complexities of regional politics at the time.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.500
And they were most certainly complex.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:59.680
She knew that having Marc Antony as her ally and lover would help secure her position, but not

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.400
only that, if he became a father to her children, the pair would have an inseparable connection.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.030
They went on to have three children together, which Antony declared to

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.610
be rulers of different Roman territories in the Eastern Mediterranean.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:24.720
What’s more, Antony divorced his wife, who just so happened to be Octavian, his main rival's sister.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.630
And if that wasn’t enough, he declared Cleopatra’s son

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.730
with Caesar to be Caesar’s true heir, not Octavian.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:40.760
Octavian had loathed Cleopatra before all this, considering her to have seduced

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.400
his brother in law and torn him away from his duties as a father and a statesman.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.720
But enough was enough.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:56.400
There had been a propaganda war waged by Octavian, with his supporters putting out pamphlets

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:02.560
portraying Cleopatra as an Eastern temptress and Marc Antony as a lost and weak general.

00:15:03.773 --> 00:15:09.083
But this would develop into a military conflict that lasted almost two years.

00:15:10.303 --> 00:15:15.543
Now we could go into a lot of detail about this war, but we must skip to the end.

00:15:16.863 --> 00:15:20.683
Octavian’s forces proved victorious, and followed Cleopatra

00:15:20.683 --> 00:15:24.353
and Marc Antony back to Egypt, to where they had fled.

00:15:25.723 --> 00:15:31.693
With Octavian advancing towards Cleopatra, she barricaded herself inside her tomb and

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:37.543
asked her servants to send a message to Marc Antony that she had committed suicide.

00:15:39.343 --> 00:15:45.403
When Marc Antony received the message he was distraught and fell on his sword, in

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:49.943
a bid to kill himself if it would have meant living in a world without Cleopatra.

00:15:51.293 --> 00:15:56.203
But Cleopatra didn’t kill herself, at least not at that point.

00:15:57.623 --> 00:16:03.073
As Marc Antony lay dying, he was reportedly told that Cleopatra wasn’t dead.

00:16:03.683 --> 00:16:06.713
He requested to be brought to her, wishing to see her

00:16:06.713 --> 00:16:10.483
one last time and show her that he had died honourably.

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:16.819
Now it was up to Cleopatra to kill herself, but before

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:20.609
she could she was detained by forces loyal to Octavian.

00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:27.069
He had grand plans to bring her to Rome and parade her around, which

00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:30.579
would have been the ultimate embarrassment for the Egyptian queen.

00:16:32.099 --> 00:16:36.029
But, as you may know, it did not end that way.

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:42.629
Legend has it that poisonous snakes, Egyptian asps, were smuggled into

00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:46.859
where Cleopatra was being kept, and she pressed them against her breast,

00:16:47.319 --> 00:16:52.259
killing herself to avoid the humiliation that she knew was awaiting her.

00:16:53.669 --> 00:16:58.179
If you have seen paintings of the death of Cleopatra, or even statues,

00:16:58.549 --> 00:17:04.179
most have her breasts showing or her dress open, and snakes nearby.

00:17:05.624 --> 00:17:08.954
Now, we don’t know whether that’s what really happened.

00:17:09.624 --> 00:17:14.084
Plutarch suggests that she might have poisoned herself by putting poison on

00:17:14.084 --> 00:17:19.324
a needle, or something like that, and that it was not her breast but her arm.

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:27.077
However it happened, the great queen killed herself, dead at the age of 39.

00:17:29.017 --> 00:17:35.067
In terms of her legacy, well we know her story really only through the writings of Romans,

00:17:35.437 --> 00:17:41.797
who sought to portray her as a seductress and temptress, someone who had managed to seduce

00:17:41.847 --> 00:17:47.997
two powerful Roman men and in so doing caused irreparable damage to the state of Rome.

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:54.699
We now know that the seducing was as much on Caesar and Marc Antony’s part as

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:59.477
Cleopatra’s, and there is no evidence that she had any other lovers than these

00:17:59.507 --> 00:18:04.867
two, while both Caesar and Marc Antony have an extensive list of former lovers.

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:09.337
But, of course, it is Cleopatra who is remembered as

00:18:09.357 --> 00:18:13.247
this sexual figure, while the two Roman generals are not.

00:18:14.647 --> 00:18:18.447
And reducing Cleopatra to the relationships she had with

00:18:18.447 --> 00:18:22.467
these prominent Romans is to do her a deep injustice.

00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:28.587
Her seduction was in her intelligence, she was clearly a captivating person to be around,

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:35.637
able not just to hold her own but to survive and thrive in a deeply unstable world.

00:18:36.687 --> 00:18:41.817
She was not Egyptian by blood, but there is little doubt that she was the greatest

00:18:41.817 --> 00:18:48.307
queen in Egyptian history, and some might even say, the greatest queen of all time.

00:18:50.727 --> 00:18:54.557
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Cleopatra,

00:18:54.837 --> 00:18:58.227
a fascinating character and clearly an amazing woman.

00:18:58.957 --> 00:19:02.957
We could have gone on for hours talking about her life and the world she

00:19:02.957 --> 00:19:07.647
found herself in, but there was so much to cover, even in a mere 39 years,

00:19:07.907 --> 00:19:11.387
that I hope you will forgive me for skipping over some of the details.

00:19:12.307 --> 00:19:15.207
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:18.397
Do you think that Cleopatra was the greatest queen of all time?

00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:22.927
If not, who should claim that title, and if we haven’t yet made an

00:19:22.927 --> 00:19:26.637
episode about her, let me know immediately and we will get onto that.

00:19:27.357 --> 00:19:32.347
The place for that is our community forum, which is at community.leonardoenglish.com, or

00:19:32.347 --> 00:19:36.497
of course you can email me directly and I will make sure we get working on that episode.

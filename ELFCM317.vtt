Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:16.714
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:20.974
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:27.594
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our mini-series on Ancient Rome.

00:00:28.008 --> 00:00:32.148
In part one we looked at the politcs of Ancient Rome and in

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:36.748
part two we told the story of Rome’s dark underbelly, slavery.

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:41.298
Today, in part three, we are going to talk about gladiators.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:47.398
A gladiator could go from being the lowest of the low, a slave, a criminal, or in

00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:54.318
extreme poverty, to being a well-loved celebrity, idolised by men and adored by women.

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:58.958
Children had toys of their favourite gladiators and women would

00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:03.058
even buy their sweat, believing it to be a sort of love potion.

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:08.218
But for most gladiators, their lives were far from glamorous.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:14.528
And in today’s episode we will tell their story, the training, the diets, the fights,

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:19.828
and how some, just some, might fight well enough to never have to fight again.

00:01:21.258 --> 00:01:23.258
OK, let’s get right into it.

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:28.548
And to start our story, we are actually going to begin at the end,

00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:32.848
with the fight which ended the tradition of gladiators in ancient Rome.

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:40.068
It does involve a death, not of a gladiator, but of a monk, of a holy man.

00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:45.311
And this fight wasn’t between a monk and a gladiator or a

00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:49.461
monk and another monk, it was between a monk and the audience.

00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:52.491
The monk’s name was Telemachus.

00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:58.381
He had travelled to Rome in 404 AD from the East and found his

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:03.191
way into the Colosseum only to be horrified by what he saw.

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:09.891
Furious fighting with weapons clashing and blood gushing met with delighted cheers

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:15.741
from a roaring crowd of thousands of people who were thrilled by the brutal spectacle.

00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:21.321
Telemachus could not believe the horror of the combat nor the audience’s

00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:27.161
excitement over it and in a bid to stop the violence, he ran into the arena.

00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:35.231
The gladiators were more likely shocked and confused by the boldness of the monk and, despite him

00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:42.211
being unarmed, and no challenge to them, it was not at their hands that Telemachus met his end.

00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:49.611
As Telemachus refused to get out of the way, the audience started screaming at him.

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:50.661
"Move out!

00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:51.571
Get out of the way!"

00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:58.361
But Telemachus would not move, determined to put an end to the horrors before him.

00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.881
The audience grew more and more frustrated and soon began

00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:07.661
throwing rocks at the monk, in a bid to get him to move.

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:12.571
If Telemachus wasn’t going to move and let the gladiators

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:17.141
get on with the show, well he would become the main event.

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:22.621
The rocks rained down, and Telemachus, this holy man,

00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:27.301
was stoned to death by a furious and blood thirsty crowd.

00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:33.771
Upon hearing of the murder of the monk, the emperor at the time, Honorius

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:38.811
was deeply disturbed and so, he declared the monk to be a martyr and

00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:43.721
banned the gladitorial games forever, there was never another event again.

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:51.091
It is a grim ending but appropriately reflects the gladiators’ gruesome lives of bloodshed,

00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:56.961
captivity, combat, as well as their undeniable popularity throughout ancient Rome.

00:03:57.771 --> 00:04:02.701
The Roman public loved these events so much that they were willing to kill for them.

00:04:03.801 --> 00:04:08.131
So, who were these gladiators, and how did this tradition start?

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:15.481
It is believed that the gladiators were first introduced in 264 BC, when the

00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:21.161
sons of a Roman general called Junius Brutus honoured their dead father by having

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:26.751
slaves fight to the death at his funeral, in an act of brutal human sacrifice.

00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:33.871
This was an example of a Roman practice called Munera, in which war leaders and

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:39.291
individuals of high status were expected to be honoured with displays of courage.

00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:48.251
Junius Brutus’s funeral started a trend among Rome’s wealthy and these types of events became much

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:54.511
more common at funerals, and soon the lower classes were invited to join the events as spectators.

00:04:55.651 --> 00:05:01.731
As they grew in popularity, the commemorative, or celebratory, fights moved

00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:06.621
from private property to public stages so there could be larger audiences.

00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:12.401
They also began to incorporate exciting narratives, as fighters would

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:16.711
dress up as different Roman enemies such as the Gauls or Thracians.

00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:23.261
Over time, the religious element of the events faded away and they

00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:27.741
were transformed into commercialised performances for a new market

00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:31.191
of Romans who were willing to pay for this form of entertainment.

00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:37.401
Eventually, though, admission to the fights would become free as emperors paid

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:43.281
all the expenses for their citizens, allowing all Roman citizens, rich and poor,

00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:48.851
to flock to fighting arenas and enjoy the violence for absolutely no cost at all.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:54.451
Seems like a rather strange thing for a leader to invest in, perhaps.

00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:58.531
Well, it wasn’t without reason, as the events became key

00:05:58.531 --> 00:06:01.941
ways for leaders to gain popularity among their people.

00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:06.901
So, who were these individuals that were willing to walk into

00:06:06.911 --> 00:06:11.581
an arena to engage in brutal fighting and even face death?

00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:16.131
Well to begin with, it was slaves belonging to the

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:19.181
rich who would be expected to engage in the fighting.

00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:25.131
As time passed, though, ordinary men began to sign up to become

00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:29.821
gladiators, attracted by the fame, glory, and paychecks of the fighters,

00:06:30.191 --> 00:06:34.731
as gladiators were paid each time they fought, and it could pay quite well.

00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:40.591
Towards the end of the second century AD, each fight could have won

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:46.311
a gladiator between 12 and 75 sesterces, depending on their status,

00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.801
or fame, and how popular the event would be amongst the public.

00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:57.171
For context, a loaf of bread or bottle of wine - two essentials of course - would have cost around

00:06:57.171 --> 00:07:04.401
half a sesterce, so a popular gladiator could earn the equivalent of about 150 bottles of wine.

00:07:05.521 --> 00:07:10.711
But how could these fighters go from unskilled slaves and normal

00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:15.601
citizens to powerful and impressive gladiators victorious in the arena?

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:22.471
You may not be surprised to learn that to become a gladiator there were intense training regimes.

00:07:23.064 --> 00:07:29.044
There were over 100 gladiator schools throughout the Roman empire and the most famous, the

00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:34.054
most prestigious one, was called the Ludus Magnus, which was right next to the Colosseum.

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:41.434
Well, we say schools but really, this is quite a nice term for what they really were.

00:07:42.484 --> 00:07:47.914
As you might expect, the training at these schools was extremely strict and intense,

00:07:48.174 --> 00:07:53.554
and despite the fact that gladiators were so celebrated throughout the empire, they

00:07:53.554 --> 00:07:59.234
lived very tough lives in facilities that were more like prisons than anything else.

00:08:00.434 --> 00:08:06.364
Gladiators would be kept in chains and they would remain in their tiny cells unless they

00:08:06.364 --> 00:08:11.644
were released for training or for mealtimes, during which they were not allowed to talk.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:18.714
Hollywood would have you believe that gladiators ate platters of meat to get the protein they

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:25.434
needed to grow muscle but it has actually been found that gladiators were predominantly vegetarian.

00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:29.734
Clearly, this wasn’t out of any sympathy for the

00:08:29.734 --> 00:08:32.984
welfare of animals or a concern for the environment.

00:08:33.234 --> 00:08:35.844
It was in an effort to cut costs.

00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:42.324
They had 3 meals a day that were mainly barley and beans, which provided them

00:08:42.324 --> 00:08:47.658
with the energy they needed and earned them the nickname of ‘barley eaters’.

00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:51.844
They even had energy drinks which were made from plant

00:08:51.874 --> 00:08:56.624
ashes and were used to aid healing after physical activity.

00:08:57.834 --> 00:09:03.164
As well as being cost efficient, the diet was intended to ensure the gladiators would have

00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:08.854
enough strength and fat on their bodies to protect them during battles, so that they could

00:09:08.854 --> 00:09:14.944
receive gory injuries to delight the crowd without actually harming important organs.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:19.074
In other words, this diet would mean they would have

00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:23.714
enough fat on them for them to bleed a lot but not die.

00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:28.674
Gladiators, after all, became investments for many slave

00:09:28.694 --> 00:09:32.274
owners and they did not want them to die during fights.

00:09:33.254 --> 00:09:39.224
And despite the common belief that gladiators would always fight to the death, modern scholars

00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:47.114
believe that around 80-85% of defeated gladiators would survive each fight, they wouldn’t be killed.

00:09:48.144 --> 00:09:53.124
And in terms of how many fights a gladiator would take part in throughout his

00:09:53.124 --> 00:09:58.714
career, this varied greatly depending on their popularity and skill level.

00:09:59.664 --> 00:10:05.674
Of course, if you were a bad fighter, you would probably not last long enough to have many fights.

00:10:06.194 --> 00:10:12.354
But if you were strong, and you continued to beat your opponents, fame and glory followed.

00:10:13.994 --> 00:10:18.124
There is an account of one gladiator during the early second century

00:10:18.464 --> 00:10:23.114
AD who fought for nine days in a row, which was so rare and impressive

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:27.234
he was actually released and given freedom after his ninth fight.

00:10:28.074 --> 00:10:30.004
He was clearly an exception though.

00:10:30.704 --> 00:10:36.534
Most modern estimates believe that gladiators usually fought between 2 and 4

00:10:36.534 --> 00:10:41.774
times a year, which allowed them time to heal after suffering any injuries.

00:10:42.414 --> 00:10:48.614
In order to speed up their recovery, gladiators received some of the best medical care available.

00:10:49.564 --> 00:10:54.724
For example, the Roman physician Claudius Galenus, who famously discovered

00:10:54.724 --> 00:10:58.924
the function of kidneys and arteries became a surgeon to the gladiators.

00:10:59.734 --> 00:11:06.114
But a gladiator’s medical care did little to lessen the pains of their life of physical training

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:12.304
in which every single day was dedicated to developing the skills necessary to give a good fight.

00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:17.384
Initial training would usually last around four months and

00:11:17.514 --> 00:11:21.234
was focused on getting a gladiator to their peak of fitness.

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:25.544
This would be achieved through callisthenics, strength training,

00:11:25.824 --> 00:11:29.894
in which gladiators would do exercises like push ups and sit ups.

00:11:30.774 --> 00:11:35.634
To learn how to fight, gladiators would use wooden weapons, with the type of

00:11:35.634 --> 00:11:39.424
weapon depending on which category of gladiator they were being trained as.

00:11:40.444 --> 00:11:44.074
The four main types of gladiator were Samnites, also

00:11:44.074 --> 00:11:48.504
known as Secutors, Thraces, Murmillo and Retiarius.

00:11:49.324 --> 00:11:54.834
Samnites were originally named after defeated enemies of the early Republic and are the

00:11:54.834 --> 00:12:00.914
most heavily armed of all the gladiators with a large shield, a helmet and a short sword.

00:12:02.204 --> 00:12:07.294
This type of gladiator was an impressive sight, relying on his giant shield

00:12:07.294 --> 00:12:12.134
for protection from enemy attacks while his short sword ensured his own attacks

00:12:12.134 --> 00:12:17.564
were swift and agile so he was usually able to gain the most strikes in a fight.

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:23.374
The next class was the Thraces, named after another Roman enemy.

00:12:24.284 --> 00:12:30.744
These gladiators often fought in pairs and they usually had a curved dagger and a shield,

00:12:31.014 --> 00:12:36.124
though sometimes this dagger would be swapped for a spear for some more long range action.

00:12:36.841 --> 00:12:40.186
The infamous Spartacus was a Thraex fighter.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:47.481
In the fighting ring, Thraces were most often up against the Samnites for a furious frenzy of sword

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:54.301
stabbing and shield clashing, as similar to the Samnites, the Thraces were quick and agile fighters.

00:12:55.311 --> 00:13:00.261
Speed was their selling point and paired with the Samnites, they delivered some

00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:04.441
of the most exciting fights which became the most popular throughout the Empire.

00:13:06.021 --> 00:13:12.200
Our third class of gladiator, the Murmillo, is the most general class but most iconic.

00:13:12.671 --> 00:13:15.661
When you picture a gladiator, it's probably the

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:18.131
Murmillo type of gladiator that you are thinking about.

00:13:19.281 --> 00:13:23.531
This type of gladiator had a long Greek style straight sword

00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:27.101
and a large helmet which protected their face from attacks.

00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:32.521
These helmets would have only added to the atmosphere of a fight, hiding the

00:13:32.521 --> 00:13:37.091
fighter’s face and leaving him to the fantasy of his fans in the audience.

00:13:38.031 --> 00:13:42.961
A murmillo fighter would also often have a large Roman shield and,

00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:46.891
in order to carry the weight of his weapons, this class of fighter

00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:51.311
would normally include some of the largest and strongest gladiators.

00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:56.111
Their strength and heavy weaponry made them a bit slower than other

00:13:56.111 --> 00:14:00.591
types of gladiators but their large shield allowed them to block incoming

00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:04.511
attacks while their long sword could reach out for a counter-strike.

00:14:05.451 --> 00:14:09.001
They may not have provided the fastest of fights, but their

00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:12.341
size and strength was a popularity spectacle on its own.

00:14:13.251 --> 00:14:16.991
The final class of gladiator was the Retiarius, who were,

00:14:17.311 --> 00:14:20.971
arguably, the strangest of the different types of gladiator.

00:14:21.951 --> 00:14:26.821
These fighters were not modelled on any former enemy or inspired

00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:31.061
by a strong soldier, no, a Retiarius was modelled on a fisherman.

00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:36.081
The Retiarius had no helmet, no shield, no sword.

00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:40.401
What they did have was a heavy metal fishing net

00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:45.041
and a trident, a spear with three prongs on the end.

00:14:46.491 --> 00:14:51.661
This was perhaps the most theatrical of all the fighting styles, as they

00:14:51.661 --> 00:14:55.501
would run around the ring attempting to catch their opponent in their net.

00:14:56.601 --> 00:15:00.301
If they were quick enough and managed to catch them, then they would then

00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:03.971
stab them with the trident while they were trapped under the metal net.

00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:09.921
As you can see, the gladiator fights were not just a furied frenzy of

00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:14.451
attacks, they had special rules and certain expectations from an audience.

00:15:14.961 --> 00:15:18.101
In the gladiator schools the fighters would have to learn

00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:21.591
how to fulfil their specific role and how to do it well.

00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:24.741
After all, their life did depend on it.

00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:29.591
Now, in order to learn how to fight in these particular styles,

00:15:29.771 --> 00:15:32.961
the gladiators would learn how to properly use their weapons.

00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:37.921
They would usually train using a wooden pole as a target and they

00:15:37.921 --> 00:15:41.371
would strike with their wooden weapons that were made to be exactly the

00:15:41.371 --> 00:15:45.491
same weight as the real thing in order to train the correct muscles.

00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:50.501
And this is what life would be like for the gladiators for at least

00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:54.731
five years, which would be the minimum they would be bound to their

00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:59.081
trainer or manager and during which time they were not allowed to leave.

00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:03.861
And of course, this was only five years if they survived in the arena.

00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:11.051
So, to the fights themselves, what actually happened when a gladiator swapped his

00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:16.641
wooden training sword for his steel one, and the time came to step into the arena?

00:16:17.591 --> 00:16:21.421
Well, these fights were set within massive events that

00:16:21.421 --> 00:16:25.681
continued over a number of days much like the Olympic games.

00:16:26.851 --> 00:16:32.033
At the Colosseum, 50,000 Romans would gather to watch the brutal spectacles.

00:16:32.713 --> 00:16:36.813
The fights were a popular event for Romans from all walks of

00:16:36.813 --> 00:16:41.003
life, all areas of society, from Emperors to street sellers.

00:16:42.113 --> 00:16:46.263
In the weeks leading up to the event there would be posters advertising

00:16:46.263 --> 00:16:51.243
the fight as well as other attractions such as public executions or music.

00:16:51.973 --> 00:16:55.133
They would also advertise luxuries like food and drink,

00:16:55.373 --> 00:16:59.013
shelter from the sun, and even prizes for audience members.

00:17:00.493 --> 00:17:05.543
The event would begin with a large ceremony that featured music and prayers to the gods.

00:17:06.403 --> 00:17:11.453
There would then be fights between animals, using all sorts of exotic creatures that had

00:17:11.453 --> 00:17:17.923
been hunted during wars, such as lions, elephants, zebras, crocodiles and countless others.

00:17:19.023 --> 00:17:24.323
Sometimes, however, it would not only be animals fighting each other, as criminals

00:17:24.523 --> 00:17:29.833
who were condemned to death were often left in the area with an angry lion or tiger.

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:34.553
But such horrific scenes were not enough, the Romans

00:17:34.693 --> 00:17:38.183
had come for the main event, the gladiator fights.

00:17:39.313 --> 00:17:42.983
The typical arrangement was a duel between two fighters,

00:17:43.453 --> 00:17:46.513
they could be of the same or different types of gladiator.

00:17:47.613 --> 00:17:50.773
The most important factor was that the gladiators would

00:17:50.773 --> 00:17:54.293
be of a similar skill level, leading to a good fight.

00:17:55.153 --> 00:17:57.083
You didn’t want a quick death after all.

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:02.153
During the match, there were strict rules to follow and a referee,

00:18:02.453 --> 00:18:06.503
who was usually a retired gladiator, and would monitor the action.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.710
They could pause the fight to allow the gladiators to rest and get

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:16.730
refreshments, and if a gladiator was not giving a good enough fight, they

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.810
would be whipped or burnt to force them to fight with more enthusiasm.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:26.580
A standard fight would last between 15 to 20 minutes and would

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.320
be accompanied by music that would only add to the suspense.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:36.440
The gladiators would be expected to display great showmanship, playing a

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:41.510
character with confidence and attitude, all while displaying their weapons skills.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.720
So, how did a gladiator “win” a fight?

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.750
Well, the easy answer is, of course, by killing their opponent, but

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:55.210
it might surprise you to find out that some of Rome’s most celebrated

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:59.670
gladiators often barely caused any severe injuries to their opponents.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.720
A gladiator would win if their opponent surrendered, if they were too

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.600
badly injured or in a position in which they could easily be killed.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:15.690
To surrender, the loser would raise a single finger and the referee would end the fight.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.630
So, what would “ending the fight” actually mean in practical terms?

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.770
Well, for the “winning gladiator”, it would mean a cash reward.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.480
As you heard earlier, this could have been anything

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.930
between 12 and 75 sesterces, depending on their popularity.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.850
But aside from this payment, winning sometimes also meant freedom.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.480
If they had fought for at least 3 years, a winning gladiator could be awarded the

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.190
‘rudis’ , a wooden sword that symbolised that they were now free from being a gladiator.

00:19:54.370 --> 00:20:00.290
A notorious gladiator called Flamma rejected the rudis four times, choosing

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.580
to remain a gladiator for thirteen years until he was killed in battle.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:11.240
But for the losing gladiator, clearly his fate was more precarious.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.110
Popular perception, what most people think, typically involves a powerful

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:22.460
emperor or politician holding out his thumb, while the audience wait with

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:26.650
bated breath to see whether the defeated gladiator was going to be granted

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.980
mercy, or whether he would be killed for the enjoyment of the crowd.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.470
The reality was often a little different.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.810
While the emperor could have a say on the outcome if he actually attended a match, given how

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:46.560
many fights there were throughout the empire, the emperor simply couldn’t go to every one.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.300
Instead, the decision on whether the defeated gladiator would be condemned to death

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.920
was often left to the referee, who would often look to the audience to judge the mood.

00:20:59.032 --> 00:21:04.788
People in the audience would make it clear what they wanted, sometimes mercy, sometimes death.

00:21:06.178 --> 00:21:10.168
These commands were accompanied with various hand gestures

00:21:10.418 --> 00:21:14.418
although historians are undecided on what exactly these would be.

00:21:15.448 --> 00:21:20.468
The most common belief is that a closed fist would mean mercy while

00:21:20.558 --> 00:21:24.258
sticking out your thumb would mean they wanted the loser to be killed.

00:21:25.038 --> 00:21:28.828
The audience would usually expect mercy to be given to a fighter

00:21:29.058 --> 00:21:32.838
who had given a good show or demonstrated impressive skills.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:38.528
However, if a gladiator hadn’t given a good fight, if he hadn’t tried his best

00:21:38.528 --> 00:21:43.908
or had been cowardly, the audience would cry out for him to be killed, and

00:21:44.188 --> 00:21:48.898
even in his dying moments a gladiator had to live up to the rules of the fight.

00:21:50.098 --> 00:21:55.468
The losing gladiator was expected to die honourably by grabbing the thigh of

00:21:55.468 --> 00:22:00.668
his opponent who would then hold his head and push his sword into his neck.

00:22:02.078 --> 00:22:06.308
After he died, his body was removed from the arena by two men

00:22:06.488 --> 00:22:11.198
dressed as Charon, the god of death, and Hermes, the messenger god.

00:22:12.718 --> 00:22:18.278
One gladiator who was never killed in the ring, however, was a man called Commodus.

00:22:18.888 --> 00:22:23.918
And this was because he wasn’t really a gladiator, he was the Emperor Commodus.

00:22:25.168 --> 00:22:31.368
Despite being the most powerful person in the Roman Empire, he appeared in over 700 fights at the

00:22:31.378 --> 00:22:37.098
Colosseum, much to the shock of his government who considered it disgraceful and irresponsible.

00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:42.851
Even many of his Roman citizens thought it was inappropriate for an emperor

00:22:43.018 --> 00:22:47.318
to be performing in the arena instead of fighting Rome’s real enemies.

00:22:48.548 --> 00:22:52.098
When gladiators had to fight the emperor, they did not dare

00:22:52.098 --> 00:22:55.598
put him in any real harm and always surrendered to him.

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:59.758
His opponents, however, weren’t always so lucky.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.608
As Hercules had famously fought giants with a club in Greek mythology,

00:23:05.994 --> 00:23:11.218
Commodus had Roman citizens who were missing limbs or feet be tied together

00:23:11.388 --> 00:23:15.618
to pretend they were giants, and he would then beat them to death with a club.

00:23:16.918 --> 00:23:20.128
On another occasion, he disgusted his people when

00:23:20.128 --> 00:23:23.778
he reportedly slaughtered 100 lions in a single day.

00:23:24.858 --> 00:23:28.488
Eventually his shocking behaviour led to his assassination,

00:23:28.698 --> 00:23:33.018
when he was strangled in the bath by a wrestler in 192 AD.

00:23:34.038 --> 00:23:38.028
By the way, if you have seen the Ridley Scott film “Gladiator”, the

00:23:38.028 --> 00:23:42.348
nasty emperor who is killed by Maximus is based on this emperor.

00:23:44.608 --> 00:23:49.978
Even after Commodus’ death, gladiatorial games continued for another 200 years,

00:23:50.118 --> 00:23:55.478
despite being banned by the first Christian emperor, Constantine in 325 AD.

00:23:56.358 --> 00:24:03.352
Then, in 404AD, Telemachhus, the monk, arrived in Rome, and–as you heard at the start

00:24:03.352 --> 00:24:09.128
of the episode–his gruesome end did cause this gruesome activity to be stopped for good.

00:24:10.208 --> 00:24:15.238
Historians are divided over exactly how many men died in the arenas

00:24:15.433 --> 00:24:18.984
during the almost 1000 years the gladiator fights took place.

00:24:19.964 --> 00:24:27.334
Some estimates have it as up to 400,000, the population of a medium-sized city, whose blood

00:24:27.484 --> 00:24:34.594
was spilled at the Colosseum alone, all for the enjoyment of the bloodthirsty, baying crowds.

00:24:36.964 --> 00:24:42.034
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on Roman gladiators, and

00:24:42.184 --> 00:24:46.144
with it comes the end of this three-part mini-series on Ancient Rome.

00:24:46.834 --> 00:24:50.634
We have gone from the mythical founding of Rome’s monarchy, the rise

00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:54.564
and fall of the Republic, its treacherous transition to the Empire

00:24:54.614 --> 00:24:59.084
and even beyond, following the stories of slavery and gladiators.

00:24:59.744 --> 00:25:04.854
As always I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:25:05.334 --> 00:25:09.294
Do you think gladiators deserve the title of ancient celebrities?

00:25:09.734 --> 00:25:14.074
How does Rome’s obsession with gladiators and its dependency on

00:25:14.074 --> 00:25:18.704
slaves change your perception of its value as a civilisation?

00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:24.894
Or was it simply too long ago for us to judge it in the way we would do a modern society?

00:25:25.304 --> 00:25:28.634
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

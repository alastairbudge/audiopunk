Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.200
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.570
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.330
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the first part of a mini-series on Ancient Rome.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.840
In today’s episode, part one, we’ll look at the politics of Ancient

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.720
Rome, how it went from a Republic to an Empire, how the political systems

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.150
actually functioned, and the legacy that this has left on modern politics.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.520
In the next part we’ll look at the harsh lives of the people who

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.420
kept it all together, the millions of people who were kept as slaves.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.970
And then in part three, the final part of this

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.980
mini-series, we will look at the bloody life of gladiators.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.780
So let’s get started and take our first steps into the world of Ancient Rome and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.180
learn more about one of the most influential political systems in human history.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:20.070
On March 14th, 144 BC, a group of men gathered in a large meeting hall in Ancient Rome.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.670
As one of the men took his seat, a group started to crowd around him.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.290
As the man waved the group away, another individual grabbed

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.150
him by the shoulders and pulled down his white toga.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.370
Amongst the fuss, another man drew a knife and aimed at the first man's neck, but missed.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.600
Shocked and confused, the first man cried out calling

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.610
his attacker a villain and asking him what he was doing.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.740
But his words were to no avail.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.710
Another man revealed his knife, pulled it out and pushed the cold, hard steel into the man's back.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.030
Before long the group had joined in and the first man would

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.530
be stabbed at least 23 times, his toga red with his own blood.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.730
That man's name was Julius Caesar.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.670
And while this might be the most famous incident in Roman politics, it

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.250
is just one of a long story of violence, betrayals, and the constant

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.800
struggle to create and maintain a fair and functional political system.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.840
So, with that in mind, let us take a look at how Ancient Rome developed one

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.460
of the most famous political systems in world history, and then lost it all.

00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:50.888
The beginnings of Rome are set within myth and legend.

00:02:51.438 --> 00:02:57.448
Originally, the city was named Latium and its mythical origin story involved

00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:03.568
two brothers Romulus and Remus, who were twin sons of the war god, Mars.

00:03:04.438 --> 00:03:08.408
The story goes that after being thrown into a river as

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:13.128
infants they miraculously survived and were raised by a wolf.

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:21.688
When they grew up Romulus killed his twin brother and established the city, Rome, named after him.

00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:29.868
Now, most people remember Rome for its democratic-style political system, but in Rome’s earliest

00:03:29.868 --> 00:03:40.788
days, from around 753 BC to 509 BC, it was ruled by a King who was advised by a small senate.

00:03:41.828 --> 00:03:48.538
The word ‘senate’ derives from Latin and translates to English roughly as ‘council of the

00:03:48.538 --> 00:03:55.308
Elders’, so the senate was essentially a group of older men who advised on political matters.

00:03:56.728 --> 00:04:01.108
Rome functioned as a kingdom until its seventh and final

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:05.448
king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, or Tarquin the Proud.

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:12.378
Tarquin had usurped, stolen, the throne from his wife’s father, Servius Tullius.

00:04:13.518 --> 00:04:17.659
Tarquin and his wife’s murdered Servius, and this would only

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.939
be the first of many terrible acts from the “proud” usurper.

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:30.099
Over time, he proved himself to be an arrogant tyrant who increasingly ignored his senate.

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:39.649
The final straw was when Tarquin’s son raped a nobleman’s wife, Lucretia, and drove her to suicide.

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:44.249
Lucretia’s husband and many other noblemen in the army

00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:48.059
vowed to remove Tarquin and his family from the throne.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.579
And it was not long before the noblemen gathered support from the army

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:59.589
and launched their revolt, successfully overthrowing Tarquin in 509 BC.

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:07.969
After Tarquin’s defeat, and after nearly 245 years of being ruled by a monarch,

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:14.159
Rome welcomed a new form of government, the Republic or, the ‘Res Publica’.

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.339
This term can be loosely translated to English as ‘public

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.329
affair’, which captures the types of changes that took place.

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:29.469
Rome transformed into a more democratic system, and Romans

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.529
would contribute to political decisions through votes.

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:37.609
Who exactly voted, though, would change considerably over time.

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:44.119
The key change from kingdom to republic was that the power that had originally

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:50.009
been held by one figure, the king, became much more dispersed, spread

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.169
out, in an attempt to prevent any tyrant like Tarquin ever ruling again.

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:03.179
The role of the king was replaced by 2 figures called ‘consuls’ who were given what was called

00:06:03.579 --> 00:06:10.619
‘imperium’, which was essentially supreme power in the Roman state and the ability to lead an army.

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:17.369
The army was, after all, of huge importance to Rome given that it was almost

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:22.739
constantly at war in efforts to conquer other lands to expand Roman territories.

00:06:23.989 --> 00:06:29.499
Unlike the Greeks who made their fortunes primarily through trade, the Romans

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:35.329
relied on war and conquest, which allowed them not only to extract taxes from

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.149
their conquered lands, but to take the defeated as prisoners to become slaves.

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:46.549
These slaves would be put to work in various roles throughout Rome and became

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:51.059
a vital part of the economy, as we will talk more about in the next episode.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:55.039
So, back to the political roles of ancient Rome.

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:01.379
The consuls were at the top, and had supreme control of Rome’s powerful military.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:06.690
Political roles in Rome without imperium were the ‘praetors’ who were

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.439
in the beginning, essentially, tribal leaders but their role developed

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:15.859
over the centuries into a more formal office of judges of Roman law.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:20.769
Other roles without imperium were quaestors who managed

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:24.629
finances and held administrative, or organisational, roles.

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:30.679
The censors, on the other hand, were in charge of the census, the record of the population.

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:37.798
And there were also people called aediles who looked after public buildings and public events.

00:07:38.228 --> 00:07:42.268
So, that’s a brief overview: two consuls at the top,

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:45.688
and different administrative political roles below them.

00:07:47.138 --> 00:07:54.818
Because the consuls held so much power, Romans, with a certain foresight or caution, put

00:07:54.878 --> 00:08:01.568
measures in place to avoid abuses and to prevent a repeat of the tyrannies of Tarquin the Proud.

00:08:02.828 --> 00:08:07.268
One of these measures was that the two consuls had the power to

00:08:07.568 --> 00:08:12.258
overrule, or ‘veto’, the other if necessary, ensuring that they always

00:08:12.288 --> 00:08:17.168
agreed on decisions and power remained more balanced between the pair.

00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:24.278
Another interesting element to Ancient Rome was the creation of the role of “dictator”.

00:08:24.728 --> 00:08:29.208
Now, when we think of the word “dictator” today, it has some pretty

00:08:29.338 --> 00:08:34.088
negative connotations, but in Ancient Rome it was a legitimate role.

00:08:34.908 --> 00:08:38.608
A dictator was appointed in extraordinary circumstances,

00:08:38.858 --> 00:08:41.948
for example when the consuls were away at war.

00:08:43.068 --> 00:08:49.408
This role gave one person the power to lead the Republic for either six months or until

00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:54.678
the emergency was over and the consul could return to their positions, and it meant that

00:08:54.698 --> 00:08:59.678
political decisions could continue to take place, even in the absence of the consuls.

00:09:00.328 --> 00:09:01.068
Clever, right?

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:08.658
Now, not all elements of the previous monarchical system were done away with, were removed.

00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:12.448
One element that was kept was the “Senate”.

00:09:13.598 --> 00:09:19.498
In its early days, the senate began at only 100 members but it quickly

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:23.888
increased over the years and gained more power as the Republic grew.

00:09:25.348 --> 00:09:29.328
In Rome, it would meet in venues that are replicated in

00:09:29.438 --> 00:09:33.748
modern U.S senate houses, with curved benches in rows.

00:09:34.778 --> 00:09:40.898
But while modern day senators line the seats in smart suits, Roman senators

00:09:40.898 --> 00:09:45.218
would take their place in white togas with purple robes over the top.

00:09:46.188 --> 00:09:49.828
They were some of the only individuals in Roman society who

00:09:49.968 --> 00:09:53.538
could wear the colour, which symbolised their power and wealth.

00:09:54.758 --> 00:10:00.868
The Roman senate had begun with an advisory role but over time it became

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:05.298
clear that they were very much directing or instructing the consul.

00:10:06.078 --> 00:10:12.968
The huge role of the senate even led to the emblem of S.P.Q.R, an abbreviation

00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:17.148
of the Latin phrase that translates as ‘The Senate and the People of Rome’.

00:10:18.138 --> 00:10:24.298
The emblem even eventually appeared like a government stamp on Roman currency and legal documents.

00:10:25.508 --> 00:10:30.208
The number of people in Rome who actually had a say, though, was small,

00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:35.278
as the privilege of voting was reserved for only some male citizens.

00:10:36.088 --> 00:10:41.008
Women in Roman society were not permitted to vote at all, nor could those

00:10:41.028 --> 00:10:45.648
men who were not classed as Roman citizens, such as slaves or criminals.

00:10:46.568 --> 00:10:52.508
So, how did it work for those deemed worthy enough to have a say in the democratic system?

00:10:53.398 --> 00:10:57.328
Well, although we are talking about over 2,000 years ago, the

00:10:57.328 --> 00:11:01.378
system isn’t so dissimilar from modern democratic systems.

00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:06.928
The main difference is that the Roman Republic was a “direct democracy”,

00:11:07.068 --> 00:11:10.628
whereas most modern democracies are “representative democracies”.

00:11:11.908 --> 00:11:18.228
What this means in practical terms is that in a “direct democracy”, citizens vote on

00:11:18.228 --> 00:11:24.098
what decisions should be taken, whereas in a “representative democracy” citizens vote for

00:11:24.098 --> 00:11:29.728
politicians, or political parties, and those people take the decisions on their behalf.

00:11:30.658 --> 00:11:32.498
So, back to Rome.

00:11:32.928 --> 00:11:36.968
Those allowed to vote were organised into two assemblies:

00:11:37.248 --> 00:11:39.918
the Tribal Assembly and the Centuriate Assembly.

00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:44.658
The Centuriate Assembly consisted of men organised into

00:11:44.658 --> 00:11:48.248
groups of 100 that reflected their status in the military.

00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:54.198
Only Romans who could arm themselves for war were members of the Centuriate Assembly.

00:11:54.838 --> 00:11:59.468
If you were not able to buy good weapons and armour you could not hold important

00:11:59.478 --> 00:12:03.518
military roles, and because of this you would struggle to earn more money.

00:12:04.338 --> 00:12:08.018
This meant that the Centuriate Assembly was heavily influenced

00:12:08.018 --> 00:12:11.538
by the richer men of Rome who made up most of its members.

00:12:12.468 --> 00:12:16.108
This assembly had the power to vote on things like the election

00:12:16.118 --> 00:12:20.298
of consuls or other high-ranking officials, and to go to war.

00:12:21.568 --> 00:12:24.748
But the poorer men would also be able to vote on other

00:12:24.748 --> 00:12:27.668
matters through something called the Tribal Assembly.

00:12:29.028 --> 00:12:32.888
This group saw voters split into the tribes that made up Rome,

00:12:33.358 --> 00:12:38.658
originally beginning with 3 but over time reaching 35 different tribes.

00:12:39.688 --> 00:12:43.538
This assembly would vote on matters outside of war and

00:12:43.698 --> 00:12:47.848
elect people for roles without imperium, such as quaestors.

00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:51.588
So how exactly did such elections work?

00:12:52.628 --> 00:12:57.568
Men, and unfortunately we are still only talking about men here, men would

00:12:57.578 --> 00:13:02.388
make their way through the hustle and bustle of the city to reach the town’s

00:13:02.588 --> 00:13:07.338
Field of Mars, a publicly owned area of land just outside of the city.

00:13:08.388 --> 00:13:14.358
Here stood a temporary wooden structure with no roof but separated aisles which the

00:13:14.358 --> 00:13:19.298
men would join according to their assembly group, so their military class or tribe.

00:13:20.328 --> 00:13:26.618
In front of the crowd, filtering into their respective assemblies, would stand the proud candidates.

00:13:27.518 --> 00:13:32.658
There would be no formal speeches prepared, they would simply remind their potential

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:38.098
voters of their credentials, their suitability for the role, and what they intended to do.

00:13:38.758 --> 00:13:42.237
The Romans were all about policy, and didn’t want

00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:45.737
voters to be swayed by the charisma of a candidate.

00:13:47.317 --> 00:13:52.787
Once they found their assembly, the men would begin to filter forward to the front of the line

00:13:53.017 --> 00:13:58.757
where they would verbally announce their vote, which election officers would immediately record.

00:13:59.857 --> 00:14:04.537
It wasn’t exactly a fair or efficient system, with little privacy,

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:09.414
lots of social pressures and, undoubtedly, mishearing and miscounting.

00:14:10.497 --> 00:14:16.477
As a result, in the second century BC, the vocal vote was abolished and men

00:14:16.477 --> 00:14:21.327
were instead given a blank tablet, a slate, with which they would inscribe

00:14:21.327 --> 00:14:25.737
the letters of who they wish to elect before they put that tablet in a box.

00:14:26.437 --> 00:14:29.707
This has clearly influenced our own voting systems today.

00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:36.170
Now, as you can see, even in its early days, ancient Rome had a very

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:41.270
sophisticated and complex political system, designed to limit abuses of

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:46.440
power and allow participation from every citizen deemed worthy enough.

00:14:47.222 --> 00:14:49.820
But it was certainly not without its flaws.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.150
Initially, the system was designed to benefit the higher-class members of society, the ‘patricians’.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:04.170
There was increasing unrest among the lower members of society, the so-called “plebeians”,

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.980
who saw the rich getting richer while they saw minimal improvements to their lot.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:17.460
This led to numerous uprisings beginning in 494 BC, less than twenty years into the Republic.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:22.470
Rome experienced a number of internal conflicts as the plebeians

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.980
demanded equality, and these continued over the next two centuries.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:31.100
The events have become known as the Conflict of the Orders.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:38.300
Concessions were made, and by 367 BC it was required that one of the two

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:43.491
consuls was a “plebeian” and “plebeians” were also allowed to become senators.

00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:46.081
Changes were afoot.

00:15:46.621 --> 00:15:51.841
But it would not be inequality or social unrest that would break the Republic.

00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:55.931
While territories continued to grow as the first century

00:15:55.937 --> 00:15:59.531
BC approached, at home, Rome was starting to crumble.

00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:05.191
The Roman historian Sallust wrote of how the increasing wealth of the rich

00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:09.411
led to the rise of a class of men who would cause the fall of the Republic.

00:16:10.061 --> 00:16:14.601
In his words, ‘there was first a lust for money, then for power’.

00:16:16.061 --> 00:16:21.945
The men he was referring to were Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Pompey, Crassus and

00:16:21.945 --> 00:16:28.831
Octavian; and, as they plotted for control and power, the Roman Republic began to change.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:35.050
There are, of course, countless factors which contributed to the fall of the Republic but

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:41.510
the key events involved the plotting, deceit and betrayal of these leading political figures.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.510
Many people see the first step in Rome’s change being the formation of the

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.900
alliance called The First Triumvirate, which was made between the powerful

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:56.910
army commanders Pompey and Caesar and the extremely wealthy Crassus.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.790
This group promoted reforms that were very popular with the Roman people and it was not

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:09.240
long before they gained a lot of power, passing laws and often going against the senate.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:15.830
But after the death of Crassus, who was killed in battle, Caesar and

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:20.400
Pompey’s relationship broke down and they soon turned on one another.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:27.310
To undermine Caesar, Pompey began to side with the senate, which demanded that Caesar

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:33.300
give up his position as army commander, in fear of the threat he posed to the state.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.780
But Caesar remained very popular with the Roman people and the pair went

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:44.488
to war, with Caesar defeating Pompey in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48BC.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.880
After his defeat, Pompey fled to Egypt but he was murdered on arrival.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.140
Following his victory in the civil war, Caesar returned

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.570
to Rome triumphant and became leader as dictator.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:04.030
Now, as a reminder, “dictator” was a legitimate position in

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.530
Ancient Rome that could be adopted in times of emergency.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.420
But, in perhaps an eerie parallel with what we see in some countries today, this

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:21.690
six-month term limit of dictator was removed, and Caesar was declared dictator for life.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:27.190
This caused great anxiety for many senators who feared Caesar would

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.210
name himself king, and the Republic would return to a monarchy.

00:18:32.458 --> 00:18:36.619
As a result, during that fateful meeting in 44 BC,

00:18:36.989 --> 00:18:40.889
Caesar felt the cold steel of his colleagues’ knives.

00:18:42.334 --> 00:18:47.364
The assassins included Marcus Junius Brutus, who was like a son to Caesar.

00:18:48.414 --> 00:18:54.254
As he lay dying in a pile of blood, Caesar uttered the famous words ‘et tu,

00:18:54.254 --> 00:18:59.974
Brute?’, or “you too, Brutus?”, when he recognised Brutus as one of his killers.

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:03.944
Not all were in support of the killing, however.

00:19:04.694 --> 00:19:09.214
After Caesar’s death, Mark Antony and Caesar’s nephew Octavian

00:19:09.534 --> 00:19:13.574
hunted down Caesar’s killers but they soon turned on each other, too.

00:19:14.784 --> 00:19:20.224
Antony was believed to be plotting against Rome with Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt

00:19:20.394 --> 00:19:26.454
and eventually, he was defeated by Octavian in the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.

00:19:27.874 --> 00:19:32.434
Following his victory, Octavian was celebrated as Rome’s saviour

00:19:32.674 --> 00:19:36.664
and he was given the title Augustus, meaning ‘the great one’.

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:42.537
Over these years, Romans had become increasingly fed up with the civil

00:19:42.537 --> 00:19:46.313
wars that had raged on since the beginning of the first century BC.

00:19:46.967 --> 00:19:51.667
This only added to Augustus’s popularity, for the Romans believed he

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:56.127
brought peace and prosperity and had the power to stop rebellious senators.

00:19:57.477 --> 00:20:03.247
Within 10 years, Augustus was given supreme power over Rome and he became the

00:20:03.247 --> 00:20:08.767
first emperor, putting an end to the almost 500 years of Republican government.

00:20:10.137 --> 00:20:13.617
As emperor, he took on the responsibilities of the consul.

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:18.857
The role of consul wasn’t completely disbanded, but they had their

00:20:18.857 --> 00:20:22.717
power stripped from them, with only decorative roles remaining.

00:20:24.247 --> 00:20:29.707
Although his uncle had been murdered because he was getting too powerful, Octavian doubled

00:20:29.727 --> 00:20:36.127
down, intimidating and murdering his opponents in the Senate, and ruling with a rod of iron.

00:20:37.037 --> 00:20:41.017
This would be a strategy almost every subsequent Emperor would follow.

00:20:42.137 --> 00:20:47.527
And while Rome remained an empire for centuries more, it would not last forever.

00:20:48.577 --> 00:20:54.917
It split into East and West in 286 AD, with each side ruled by

00:20:54.947 --> 00:20:58.947
different leaders and existing almost independently of the other.

00:20:59.887 --> 00:21:05.697
The Western Roman Empire lasted until 476 AD, while the Eastern

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:10.077
Roman Empire, or Byzantium, continued until the 15th century.

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:17.677
It began as a monarchy for 244 years, developed under a Republican system for

00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:23.867
around 500 years before flourishing as a colossal empire for over 1000 years.

00:21:24.217 --> 00:21:28.607
It’s truly turbulent history with an unmistakable legacy.

00:21:29.417 --> 00:21:34.017
While there are plenty of physical remains, from the forum to bath houses

00:21:34.017 --> 00:21:38.597
to the Colosseum, the remnants of Ancient Rome that are most clearly felt

00:21:38.847 --> 00:21:42.907
are those that we can see today through political systems around the world.

00:21:43.707 --> 00:21:49.497
Many of us live in political systems modelled on the ideas of the Republic and its

00:21:49.497 --> 00:21:55.077
fundamental concept of governing through legislative and executive democratic systems.

00:21:55.897 --> 00:22:01.507
We can see this most clearly in the United States, as the Founding Fathers paid close

00:22:01.527 --> 00:22:06.767
attention to the story of Ancient Rome when they drafted the Constitution in 1787.

00:22:07.687 --> 00:22:12.967
This resulted in the three branches of American government, the Executive,

00:22:13.227 --> 00:22:19.677
Legislative and Judicial, clearly mirroring the consul, senate, and praetors of Rome.

00:22:20.697 --> 00:22:27.227
It was certainly imperfect, but it’s astounding to think that these ideas and concepts, from over

00:22:27.227 --> 00:22:34.627
2000 years ago, have such an influence over our societies, lives and freedoms to this very day.

00:22:37.327 --> 00:22:42.347
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on The Politics of Ancient Rome.

00:22:42.837 --> 00:22:46.657
I know it might be “ancient history”, but it is amazing to see

00:22:46.657 --> 00:22:50.367
the parallels between this ancient society and the modern day.

00:22:51.407 --> 00:22:56.247
As a reminder, this is part one of a three-part mini-series on ancient Rome.

00:22:56.597 --> 00:23:01.797
Next up we’ll talk about some of the least fortunate people in ancient Roman society, the

00:23:01.807 --> 00:23:08.307
slaves, and then in part three it’ll be, well yes another unfortunate group, gladiators.

00:23:09.127 --> 00:23:12.407
As always I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:23:12.687 --> 00:23:17.497
What other parallels can you see between ancient Roman politics and the modern day?

00:23:18.077 --> 00:23:24.177
Can you think of another period in history that has been as influential on modern political systems?

00:23:24.807 --> 00:23:28.147
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

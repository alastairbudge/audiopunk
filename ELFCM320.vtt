Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.219
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.500
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.669
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Hostage Negotiations.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.750
This subject is actually going to be told in two parts.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.820
In this episode, part one, we will tell the story of two shocking hostage crises in the early

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.610
nineteen seventies, one in Florida, in the United States and the other in Munich, in Germany.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.769
And in part two, we will look at how the strange world of hostage negotiations has

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.490
developed since then, and look at some of the strategies and techniques that law

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.910
enforcement agencies use to negotiate with people in a life or death situation.

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:04.646
Ok then, hostage negotiations.

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:08.516
Think of the last time you had a conversation with someone.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:12.586
How much of the meaning you both conveyed was contained

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:16.706
in non-verbal cues like tone of voice and movement?

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:21.136
Psychologists would tell you that it was a lot.

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:27.266
If subtle signals like this matter in ordinary conversation, they

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:32.766
matter tenfold in the life-or-death scenario of hostage negotiations.

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:39.346
Hostage negotiations are the most nerve-wracking incidents that a law enforcement team can face.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:45.966
The hostage taker may have weapons, threaten violence, and be determined to follow through.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:51.996
The police may have more manpower and weapons than the hostage-taker, but these

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:57.926
capabilities are useless when the perpetrators could harm their victims at any moment.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:05.756
The negotiator must rely on words, tone, and body language to work towards a peaceful resolution.

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:10.366
And while “peaceful resolutions” are more common than ever,

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:15.426
even a matter of 50 years ago this was certainly not the case.

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:22.656
Police used to resort to force much more quickly, and the results were often not very pretty.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:30.686
One major US hostage crisis in 1971 highlighted the dangers of this strategy.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:38.766
At 1.30 am on October the 3rd 1971, in Nashville, Tennessee, a pilot

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:44.726
named Brent Downs waited on the runway next to a private charter plane.

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:50.566
He was due to fly three passengers to Atlanta, Georgia.

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:54.336
He stood on the tarmac ready to greet them.

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:59.956
The three passengers finally arrived on the runway and approached the plane.

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:05.466
One of them was George Giffe, the man who had booked the flight.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:12.916
He was accompanied by his estranged wife Susan Giffe and a man called Bobby Wayne Wallace.

00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:17.756
Downs and his co-pilot struck up a conversation with Giffe,

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:22.436
while Susan Giffe and the other man waited 100 metres away.

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:26.546
Giffe and his companions seemed ordinary enough.

00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:33.046
That was until the woman – Susan - began screaming that she was being kidnapped.

00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:37.376
Downs, the pilot, was concerned and walked towards her.

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:40.606
George Giffe assured him that nothing was wrong.

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:44.726
The screaming woman was a mental patient having a crisis, he

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:49.176
said, and he was her doctor taking her to Atlanta for treatment.

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:52.536
Downs was still suspicious.

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:55.096
He asked Giffe for proof of his identity.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:04:00.356
At this point, Giffe turned a pistol, a gun, on the pilot.

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.506
He claimed he had a bomb.

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:07.516
He and Wallace forced Downs and Susan into the aircraft

00:04:07.556 --> 00:04:11.356
and ordered Downs, the pilot, to quickly take off.

00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:17.486
With no other option, the pilot took to the air, with Giffe,

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:21.646
his estranged wife, and the third man, Bobby Wayne Wallace.

00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:26.446
The ground crew quickly alerted the FBI.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:33.116
When the plane was in the air, Giffe told Downs to change course from Atlanta to the Bahamas.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:38.986
Downs protested, saying that he would need to refuel in Jacksonville, in Florida.

00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:43.946
It was a small plane, and there simply wasn’t enough fuel to go all the way.

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:48.546
Giffe agreed and Downs called ahead to the airport at

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:53.296
Jacksonville to prepare charts, fuel, and flotation gear.

00:04:54.626 --> 00:05:01.816
At 5.08 am, the aircraft landed at Jacksonville, Florida, where the FBI was waiting.

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:07.636
During the flight, the FBI had learned that George Giffe and Bobby Wayne

00:05:07.776 --> 00:05:13.256
Wallace had kidnapped Susan, Giffe’s estranged wife, as she left for work.

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:17.886
When the plane landed, the pilot radioed the tower

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:21.784
saying that the hostage takers were armed with handguns.

00:05:22.504 --> 00:05:27.754
Giffe claimed to have over 5 kilos of explosives in his luggage.

00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:33.014
Now, the FBI’s priority was to keep the plane on the ground.

00:05:33.744 --> 00:05:39.364
Although this was a prudent strategy, as it’s clearly easier to negotiate with someone

00:05:39.544 --> 00:05:45.714
if they’re in the same place, not up in an aeroplane, the FBI soon made its first error.

00:05:46.934 --> 00:05:52.674
Almost immediately after the plane had landed, the primary FBI negotiator J.J.

00:05:52.674 --> 00:05:55.764
O’Connor radioed the hostage takers on the plane.

00:05:56.404 --> 00:06:00.524
He refused to give the hostage takers the fuel they demanded.

00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:07.114
This flat-out refusal of a key hostage demand closed any possibility of

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:11.914
compromise between the agents and Giffe, and ended lines of communication.

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:17.754
Even the pilot, Brent Downs, knew how dangerous O’Connor’s refusal was.

00:06:18.234 --> 00:06:23.544
In archived footage from the tense 6- minute standoff, Downs gave the

00:06:23.574 --> 00:06:28.584
FBI a fearful warning, saying: “You’re endangering lives by doing this”.

00:06:29.604 --> 00:06:36.014
A few minutes later, Giffe’s accomplice, Wallace, left the plane voluntarily and was arrested.

00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:43.294
According to commentators after the event, the FBI should have taken this as a small victory.

00:06:43.764 --> 00:06:46.309
They could have leveraged the departure of Giffe’s

00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:50.684
accomplice and used it to convince Giffe to surrender.

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:55.954
Instead, the FBI chose a different course of action.

00:06:56.694 --> 00:07:02.684
At 5.27 am, the primary negotiator ordered his agents to shoot.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:08.184
Bullets pierced the tyres of the plane as well as the engine, which was still running.

00:07:09.174 --> 00:07:13.384
As soon as the firearms went off, what was a tense

00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:17.214
and dangerous situation tipped over into a deadly one.

00:07:18.374 --> 00:07:20.704
Shots were heard inside the plane.

00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:26.094
Giffe had shot dead the pilot, his wife, and himself.

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:32.824
It later turned out that Giffe had been suffering from a mental health episode.

00:07:33.284 --> 00:07:38.064
A few years afterwards, the wife of the dead pilot sued the FBI for

00:07:38.064 --> 00:07:42.024
creating a deadly situation that could have been peacefully resolved.

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:49.694
She won on appeal, and it was the first time ever that the FBI has been sued in a civil suit.

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:57.294
The tragic outcome of this Florida hijacking underlined how inadequate the law

00:07:57.334 --> 00:08:02.004
enforcement agencies were when it came to saving lives in a hostage crisis.

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:07.104
They simply didn’t know what to do, and thought that by firing at the

00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:12.034
aeroplane Giffe, the man with the gun, would be frightened into surrendering.

00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:14.294
Clearly, he wasn’t.

00:08:14.864 --> 00:08:19.444
The shots tipped him over the edge, and cost the lives of three people.

00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:26.704
Less than a year later, a very different international hostage event finally shocked law

00:08:26.704 --> 00:08:32.364
enforcement around the world into taking the psychological aspects of negotiation seriously.

00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:39.604
This was the 1972 hostage crisis at the Munich Olympic Games in West Germany.

00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:45.484
A serious hostage crisis that the world watched played out on live TV.

00:08:46.464 --> 00:08:51.694
The attack was organised by Black September, an anti-Israeli terrorist

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:55.694
organisation fighting for the cause of Palestinian liberation.

00:08:56.664 --> 00:09:00.214
Unlike the Florida hijacking, the motives of the perpetrators

00:09:00.364 --> 00:09:04.814
were political and their demands were clear and rigid.

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:10.524
Like in the United States, the German authorities did not have a

00:09:10.524 --> 00:09:14.444
systemic set of procedures for handling hostage crises at the time.

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:20.144
In hindsight, this was perhaps surprising, given how

00:09:20.144 --> 00:09:23.684
politically turbulent the late sixties and early seventies were.

00:09:24.157 --> 00:09:29.504
There were tensions over the war in Vietnam, nationalism in the developing world that

00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:35.454
met pushback from imperial nations, and the growth of both right and left wing extremism.

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:42.514
Terror groups cultivated global networks to train, recruit, and raise funds for their causes.

00:09:43.564 --> 00:09:50.154
One of the sources of extremism was the 1967 brutal war between Egypt and Israel.

00:09:51.134 --> 00:09:56.264
It started after Israel was blocked by Egypt from using a key shipping route.

00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:02.854
What followed became known as the 6 Day War, and resulted in Israel capturing

00:10:02.864 --> 00:10:07.454
a lot of territory, including Gaza, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights.

00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:13.394
It also resulted in the capture of thousands of prisoners, the displacement of

00:10:13.394 --> 00:10:19.504
around 300,000 Palestinians, and no simple diplomatic solution to the situation.

00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:24.884
For some Palestinian militant groups, the only way they thought

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:28.614
they could weaken Israel would be through terror tactics.

00:10:29.214 --> 00:10:34.124
And although they had been targeting Israel before the war, they were now ready to

00:10:34.144 --> 00:10:39.154
organise international attacks that could bring the world’s attention to their cause.

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:48.524
So, in July 1972, two men, Abu Iyad and Ali Hassan Salameh, met in a café in Rome.

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:54.404
They were leaders of the militant Palestinian group, Black September, and it

00:10:54.404 --> 00:10:59.444
was then that they decided to target the upcoming Olympic Games in Munich.

00:11:01.014 --> 00:11:04.704
Abu Iyah was the one who first proposed kidnapping Israeli

00:11:04.734 --> 00:11:08.814
athletes to force Israel to release Palestinians from prison.

00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:13.864
They selected seven other young men to carry out the attack, all

00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:18.294
Palestinian refugees from camps in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.

00:11:19.764 --> 00:11:24.364
For weeks before the Olympic games started, the men infiltrated the

00:11:24.374 --> 00:11:28.574
Olympic village to understand its layout and security weaknesses.

00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:34.644
Some even got jobs there, giving them full undercover access to the site.

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:38.494
The Games began on the 26th of August.

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:42.214
On the 5th of September, the terrorists were ready.

00:11:43.094 --> 00:11:49.274
At 4.30 in the morning they snuck into 31 Connollystrasse, the apartment

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:53.124
block where the Israeli delegation to the Olympic Games were staying.

00:11:54.014 --> 00:11:57.964
They approached apartment 1, which housed 7 Israelis.

00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:02.764
An Israeli wrestler, Yossef Gutfrend, was among them.

00:12:03.464 --> 00:12:05.974
He was the first to notice that something was wrong.

00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:11.094
He heard noises outside the door and watched as it opened slightly.

00:12:12.034 --> 00:12:15.024
Beyond it, he glimpsed a group of armed men.

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:20.304
He shouted to warn his roommates and threw himself against the door.

00:12:21.464 --> 00:12:28.924
He might have been an Olympic wrestler weighing 135kg, but he was no match for 8 armed men.

00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:33.074
The terrorists overpowered him and forced him to the floor.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:39.044
From there, the eight terrorists swept the building, bedroom by

00:12:39.054 --> 00:12:43.304
bedroom, until they had eleven Israeli athletes held hostage.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:47.644
Shots were fired and the village started waking up.

00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:54.974
At 5 am, the Munich chief of police was aware of a disaster unfolding within the Olympic Village.

00:12:55.594 --> 00:13:01.884
Soon, the whole world would be transfixed on Building number 3 of Connollystrasse, in Munich.

00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:09.514
Around a billion viewers tuned in that day to watch the Olympic Park crisis unfold on their screens.

00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:13.424
The terrorists knew they had captured the attention of the

00:13:13.424 --> 00:13:16.944
international community, which is precisely what they had wanted.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:20.464
They announced their demand and deadline.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:25.304
The Israeli government must release Palestinian terrorists from

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:30.904
jail by 9:00 AM or they would start to execute the hostages.

00:13:31.884 --> 00:13:36.244
With only a few hours to comply, there was no time to waste.

00:13:37.144 --> 00:13:43.084
But the German police and security services were woefully unprepared, they

00:13:43.084 --> 00:13:48.004
simply weren’t ready, and despite the frequent terror hostage incidents

00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:53.284
over the early seventies, the security services were always one step behind.

00:13:53.804 --> 00:13:57.934
There was no armed security or checkpoints at the Munich games.

00:13:58.484 --> 00:14:02.144
The institutional make-up of German security was also

00:14:02.204 --> 00:14:04.944
badly equipped to deal with this sort of situation.

00:14:05.834 --> 00:14:11.134
In Germany, power is divided among 16 states, each with its own government.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:16.524
There was no central federal agency responsible for organising negotiations

00:14:16.544 --> 00:14:20.494
efforts, which is critical in a siege of such international importance.

00:14:21.424 --> 00:14:26.534
Instead of federal personnel, Munich police chief Manfred Schreiber

00:14:26.744 --> 00:14:30.984
and the interior minister of Bavaria state, Bruno Merk, were chosen

00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:34.784
as primary negotiators who would communicate with the terrorists.

00:14:35.664 --> 00:14:39.124
Appointing the most senior state police chief as negotiator

00:14:39.294 --> 00:14:43.044
was, as it would later transpire, a serious mistake.

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:49.684
Nowadays, a key principle of hostage negotiation is to appoint a non-senior

00:14:49.684 --> 00:14:54.404
member that specialises in hostage dialogue as the primary negotiator.

00:14:55.284 --> 00:15:01.354
This is because a subordinate officer, a more junior official, can buy more time

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:06.474
by blaming a higher authority for delays in delivering the terrorists’ demands.

00:15:07.254 --> 00:15:10.674
As we’ll see in part two, blaming other people to

00:15:10.684 --> 00:15:13.934
buy time is an important part of hostage negotiation.

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:19.756
Fifteen minutes before the 9 am deadline for Israel to release

00:15:19.776 --> 00:15:23.446
prisoners, nothing had been done to resolve the situation.

00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:28.316
At the last moment, the German authorities sent Olympic

00:15:28.316 --> 00:15:32.236
delegates from Arab nations as negotiators for the hostages.

00:15:33.206 --> 00:15:36.516
The Egyptian who was chosen for this appealed to the

00:15:36.516 --> 00:15:40.316
hostage takers to give the Israelis and Germans more time.

00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:48.036
The plan worked and the terrorists agreed to extend the deadline to noon, midday, 12pm.

00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:53.856
But then came the next glaring error in the German response.

00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:58.346
The Munich police chief Manfred Schreiber offered the

00:15:58.346 --> 00:16:02.206
terrorists $9 million dollars to release the hostages.

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:07.266
It’s over $60 million dollars in today’s money, an enormous sum.

00:16:08.016 --> 00:16:12.746
But offering this amount of money reflected how badly the

00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:16.106
authorities understood the motives of the hostage takers.

00:16:16.956 --> 00:16:23.056
In a terror hostage crisis where the demands are political, perpetrators are typically

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:27.266
more committed to their political objectives than preserving their own lives.

00:16:27.826 --> 00:16:31.926
A monetary offer can also imply that the authorities believe the

00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:35.766
terrorists can simply be paid to give up their political demands.

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:41.486
This risks offending the perpetrators and inflaming the situation further.

00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:45.586
This was certainly the case with the Munich crisis.

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:49.676
The terrorists didn’t want money, they wanted their political

00:16:49.676 --> 00:16:52.856
demands to be met, for the prisoners to be released.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:58.696
Israel would not give in to the terrorists’ demands but the German authorities

00:16:58.906 --> 00:17:03.816
had to convince the terrorists otherwise, to stop them from killing the hostages.

00:17:05.036 --> 00:17:11.146
They sent the Tunisian ambassador to West Germany to beg the terrorists to give Israel more time.

00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:14.526
They agreed to a 5 pm deadline.

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:21.986
At 4.35 p.m., Issa, the leader of the terrorists, demanded that the hostage

00:17:21.986 --> 00:17:27.376
takers, along with their Israeli hostages, should be flown to Cairo in Egypt.

00:17:28.416 --> 00:17:33.296
The Germans agreed to this and said a plane would be ready by 7pm.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:40.386
The airfield chosen was called Furstenfeldbruck and the terrorists agreed

00:17:40.456 --> 00:17:45.616
to be flown there by helicopters piloted by two Germans and a German crew.

00:17:46.926 --> 00:17:50.706
The Germans never planned for the hostage takers and

00:17:50.706 --> 00:17:54.006
their hostages to reach Cairo, their chosen destination.

00:17:55.106 --> 00:18:00.856
Unknown to the terrorists, the Egyptian government was refusing to allow them to land in Egypt.

00:18:01.626 --> 00:18:05.156
The Israelis did not want the hostages to fly to Egypt either.

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:09.396
Instead, the Germans planned to rescue the hostages

00:18:09.696 --> 00:18:13.266
on the airfield as their captors approached the plane.

00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:17.176
The helicopters carrying the hostage takers and their

00:18:17.186 --> 00:18:22.096
hostages landed at Fürstenfeldbruck airfield at 10:40 pm.

00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:27.416
By then it was dark and the airstrip was lit in floodlights.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:34.356
The German authorities had imposed a media blackout on the Fürstenfeldbruck airfield.

00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:38.756
This was their final chance to save the Israelis.

00:18:39.926 --> 00:18:44.806
Five snipers, people expert at shooting from a long distance, had

00:18:44.806 --> 00:18:49.216
been positioned around the airfield, invisible to the terrorists.

00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:53.576
Shockingly, none of them were given walkie talkies,

00:18:53.786 --> 00:18:56.776
meaning that they could not coordinate with one another.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:19:01.006
Other critical items were missing from their toolkits.

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:05.396
They did not have bulletproof vests or helmets, and none

00:19:05.536 --> 00:19:09.646
had infrared or telescopic sights fitted on their guns.

00:19:10.386 --> 00:19:14.126
They were in the dark, literally and metaphorically.

00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:22.406
When Issa and his deputy Yusuf Nazzal stepped out of the helicopters to check their plane,

00:19:22.636 --> 00:19:28.286
they quickly became suspicious it was a trap and started to run back to the helicopter.

00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:35.996
At that moment, the snipers began firing, shooting two terrorists guarding the helicopter pilots.

00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:40.306
Next, the snipers fired on Issa and Nazzal.

00:19:41.406 --> 00:19:45.406
Issa was hit but managed to crawl back to the helicopters,

00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:49.316
where he began firing out into the dark with his machine gun.

00:19:50.176 --> 00:19:56.196
At this point, all the terrorists started shooting at the snipers from the cover of the helicopter.

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:58.116
The scene was chaos.

00:19:58.336 --> 00:20:02.326
Nobody could tell which shots were being fired by whom.

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:08.246
The small team of five snipers could do nothing to disarm the terrorists.

00:20:08.746 --> 00:20:13.976
The firefight lasted for ten minutes before the Germans called for armoured backup.

00:20:14.966 --> 00:20:18.306
Until they arrived, there was nothing to do but watch.

00:20:19.396 --> 00:20:25.496
In all, one German officer was killed, several were injured, and five terrorists were killed.

00:20:26.696 --> 00:20:31.306
After the rescue operation came the final anguish for the loved ones

00:20:31.416 --> 00:20:35.826
of the hostages, who had been anxiously waiting, watching the news.

00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:43.496
The media outlet Reuters reported at 12.30 pm that all hostages had survived.

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:44.866
What a triumph!

00:20:45.816 --> 00:20:47.786
Unfortunately, it was wrong.

00:20:48.846 --> 00:20:52.446
After three hours, Reuters corrected their report.

00:20:53.796 --> 00:21:00.056
All the hostages, 11 Israelis, were lying dead on this dark, German, airfield.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:07.236
It would remain a black mark on the German security services’ reputation for years to come.

00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:14.346
Now, even though most countries do have an explicit policy of “not negotiating

00:21:14.346 --> 00:21:19.676
with terrorists”, it was clear that Munich had been an unmitigated disaster.

00:21:20.356 --> 00:21:25.836
And while everything is easy with the benefit of hindsight, security forces across the

00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:31.846
globe started to develop systems and best practices for what should have been done.

00:21:32.486 --> 00:21:37.456
Systems and practices that we will discuss in detail in part two, the next episode,

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:42.156
where we will look at the question of “How To Negotiate With Hostage Takers”

00:21:44.246 --> 00:21:50.146
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Florida & Munich Hostage Disasters.

00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:53.646

I imagine you might have known about the Munich Massacre, but

00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:04.366
were you aware of what happened on another airfield in Florida?

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:07.956
What do you think the hostage negotiators got wrong?

00:22:08.316 --> 00:22:10.196
How should they have acted differently?

00:22:10.766 --> 00:22:11.986
I would love to know.

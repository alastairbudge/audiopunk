Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.720
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.860
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.760
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.089
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.369
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.540
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.160
I'm Alastair Budge, and this is going

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.020
to be the last episode of 2022, so today

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.689
we are going to be talking about some

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.960
unusual news stories from the year,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.610
stories that, even if you live in the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.010
UK or you follow British news closely,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.520
you might not have been aware of.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.050
On our little journey we’ll come

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.980
across footballer’s wives, misbehaving

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.540
politicians, the changing demographics

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.350
of the country, a mad man with a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.189
crossbow and the crime of high treason.

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:56.207
OK then, The Unusual British News of 2022.

00:00:57.185 --> 00:00:59.577
It might sound like an understatement

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:01.767
to say that a lot has happened in the

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:04.939
UK since the first of January of 2022.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.727
The country, as of the time of recording,

00:01:08.977 --> 00:01:11.017
has had three different prime ministers,

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:13.537
experienced the hottest day on record,

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.257
and the British pound dipped to an

00:01:16.317 --> 00:01:18.287
all-time low against the dollar.

00:01:19.196 --> 00:01:22.697
But perhaps the biggest national change

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:24.807
is one you will no doubt be aware of.

00:01:25.327 --> 00:01:28.037
The country lost a queen in Elizabeth

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:31.257
II, and got a new king, Charles the III.

00:01:31.777 --> 00:01:34.307
So, our first category of unusual

00:01:34.307 --> 00:01:36.337
news is going to be related to

00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:37.797
this change in the monarchy.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.897
But before you complain and say, hey,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:42.337
you said this would be “unusual”,

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:44.577
and I already knew about this queen

00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:46.057
that you people seem to like so much,

00:01:46.327 --> 00:01:48.447
don’t worry, here you’ll learn what

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:50.437
I hope will be some unusual pieces

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:52.057
of news about the queen this year.

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:55.657
So, firstly, you probably already knew

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:57.997
that on February the 6th the Queen

00:01:58.037 --> 00:02:00.779
celebrated her Platinum Jubilee, her

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.547
70th anniversary as queen of the country.

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:06.817
You might not have known that on June

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.127
the 12th of this year she became the

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:12.427
second-longest serving monarch in world

00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:15.468
history, overtaking the king of Thailand.

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:18.008
She didn’t quite manage to

00:02:18.008 --> 00:02:19.978
claim first position, however.

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:22.768
This is still held by King Louis

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:25.278
XIV of France, although he did get

00:02:25.298 --> 00:02:27.008
a significant headstart on Queen

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:29.498
Elizabeth II, because he became

00:02:29.498 --> 00:02:31.698
king when he was a mere 4 years old.

00:02:32.908 --> 00:02:34.568
And if you are wondering whether

00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:37.198
Charles, her son, will manage to beat

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.358
his mother, well let me just tell

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.348
you that he would have to live until

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:44.438
his 144th birthday to manage that.

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:48.088
But while his mother, Queen Elizabeth,

00:02:48.328 --> 00:02:50.848
did manage to live to a ripe old 96

00:02:50.858 --> 00:02:53.188
years old, it might surprise you to find

00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:55.578
out that on Christmas Day last year,

00:02:55.858 --> 00:02:58.928
in fact, an armed intruder was arrested

00:02:59.118 --> 00:03:01.218
after attempting to break in to Windsor

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:03.908
Castle, where the queen was staying, where

00:03:04.078 --> 00:03:06.498
he was planning to assassinate her with

00:03:06.498 --> 00:03:09.108
a crossbow, a powerful bow and arrow.

00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:12.488
Sure, this was technically news from

00:03:12.488 --> 00:03:16.168
2021, but the unusual news from 2022

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:18.888
about this case is that in August of

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:22.058
2022, the man who attempted to kill

00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:24.938
the queen became the last person to be

00:03:24.948 --> 00:03:28.138
charged with treason, with the crime of

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:29.848
attempting to kill the head of state.

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:33.338
Interestingly enough, there is an act

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:36.621
of parliament, called the 1842 Treason

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.520
Act, that constitutionally allows for

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.180
someone to be charged for the crime

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.470
of attempting to harm the queen.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.420
Fortunately, she passed away peacefully in

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.980
her bed on September the 8th, she wasn’t

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.710
shot by a madman with a bow and arrow, but

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.560
it is certainly interesting and refreshing

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.180
that English law has an Act ready to

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.490
punish anyone who attempts such a crime.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.000
Now, our second “unusual” British

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.310
news story of 2022 also relates to

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.050
the law, and this is a trial that

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.990
was dubbed by the British press

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.330
as the “Wagatha Christie” trial.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.080
In practical terms, it was

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.910
a trial between two women,

00:04:18.243 --> 00:04:20.810
Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.370
You might not have heard of these

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.830
two women before, but you may

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.280
have heard of their husbands:

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.960
Jamie Vardy and Wayne Rooney.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.510
If you haven’t heard of them, they are

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.910
both famous English football players.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.740
So, why were these two women

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.680
fighting each other in court?

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.620
Well, the story went something like this.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.080
There were articles coming out in

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.880
the British press about the private

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.170
life of Coleen Rooney, stories

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.680
that she wanted to remain private

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.500
and not get leaked to the press.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.696
She thought that one of her

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.080
Instagram followers was passing

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.960
information about her private

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.600
life to the tabloid newspapers.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.350
She suspected that it was

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.030
Rebekah Vardy, the wife of her

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.600
husband’s England teammate.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.360
So, what did she do?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.510
Well, she planted “fake” stories

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.660
to try to catch Rebekah Vardy out.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.780
There is a setting on Instagram where

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.830
you can choose to only show your

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.990
Instagram Stories to certain people,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.950
so Coleen Rooney selected to only

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.550
show certain stories to Rebekah Vardy.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.040
Then if these stories appeared in the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.880
British tabloids, ta-dah, she would know

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.550
that it was Vardy who was responsible

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.470
for passing them on to the journalists.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.960
Low and behold, the stories

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.970
did appear in the press.

00:05:48.007 --> 00:05:51.600
In 2021, Rooney shocked her followers

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.730
when she revealed this plot on

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.450
Twitter, and accused Rebekah Vardy

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.510
of having sold these stories.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.670
Naturally, Vardy denied

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.100
it, she said it wasn’t her.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.250
She didn’t need the money, and why would

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.030
she do something like that to her friend?

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.560
What’s more, she took Rooney to court

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.730
for something called “libel”, which

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.670
is the crime of accusing someone in

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.890
public and harming their reputation.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.370
But Coleen Rooney stood firm,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.730
and the pair met in court.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.450
It was an extensive trial,

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.210
with the British press calling

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.310
Coleen “Wagatha Christie”.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.940
A “wag”, by the way, is a nickname

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.670
for the wives and girlfriends of

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.150
footballers, it comes from the acronym

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.710
W-A-G, WAG, wives and girlfriend.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.090
And Agatha Christie was a famous British

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.820
crime writer, so Rooney acquired this

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.210
nickname because of her combined status

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.930
as “wag” and excellent detective.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.970
On the 29th of July of 2022, the

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.020
court announced its judgement.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.080
The jury concluded that there was

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.480
enough evidence to suggest that Vardy

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.570
had actually been guilty of leaking the

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.600
stories, and the case was thrown out.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.620
The trial itself was almost like a comic

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.590
soap opera, or a bad Agatha Christie

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.430
novel, with Vardy’s agent claiming to

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.070
have dropped her phone into the North

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.860
Sea by accident, and Vardy’s supposed “IT

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.320
expert” to have forgotten the password

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.260
to important encrypted messaging data.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.250
It turned out that Rebekah Vardy had lost

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.030
more than her dignity or a mobile phone.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.340
The judge ordered her to pay Coleen

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.440
Rooney’s legal costs as well as her own,

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.840
with the entire debacle estimated to have

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.220
cost her £3 million pounds, so that’s

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.510
almost three and a half million Euros.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.970
Now, our third category of “unusual news”,

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.800
after the royals and the footballers’

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.430
wives, is relating to a category of people

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.020
you might not expect to be misbehaving.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.700
Or perhaps you would

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.100
completely expect it of them.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.800
And this is politicians.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.630
2022 was a year of some pretty bad

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.600
behaviour by British politicians.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.910
First, as you may remember, the British

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.060
Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, was

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.060
mired in controversy for the first

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.970
half of the year for having held a

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.610
series of parties at 10 Downing Street,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.440
at the home of the Prime Minister.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.670
In normal times, of course, there

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.680
would be nothing wrong with this,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.370
especially for a prime minister

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.370
who has made no secret of the fact

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.280
that he enjoys having a good time.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.770
But these parties had taken place

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.210
during strict COVID lockdowns, so while

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.290
the Prime Minister was on TV telling

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.550
people that they shouldn’t leave their

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.020
houses or socialise with anyone, he

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.320
was proved to be having extensive

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.240
gatherings that went completely against

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.660
the rules that he himself had set out.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.210
In classic Boris Johnson style, he

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.400
tried to get out of these accusations,

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.720
saying that he knew nothing about them

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.650
and that he was sure that all of the

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.200
rules had been followed, but as the

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.790
months went on, more and more details

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.830
emerged, including that Boris Johson

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.300
knew exactly what had happened and

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.540
had been at many of these parties.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.260
So, that’s certainly bad behaviour, and

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.570
was one of the many reasons that Johnson

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.450
was forced to resign in July of 2022.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.120
Now, the second “political misbehaviour”

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.070
is a very unusual one indeed, and

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.890
I’ll leave you to decide for yourself

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.820
how it compares to the behaviour of

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:40.880
Boris Johnson and the parties, or

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.460
partygate as it was dubbed by the press.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.830
In April of 2022, a group of female

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.420
Conservative members of parliament,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.780
or MPs, met with a senior politician

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.540
to discuss the issue of sexism in

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.970
Westminster, in British politics.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.060
One of the women complained that she

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.080
had been sitting next to a male MP

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.570
who had been watching pornography on

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.030
his phone in the House of Commons,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.570
in the Houses of Parliament.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.490
If you have seen pictures or videos of the

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.650
House of Commons, yes I’m talking about

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.880
those long benches with green cushions,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.700
the centre of the British parliament.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.860
She didn’t name the man, but he was later

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.150
revealed to be an MP called Neil Parish.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.780
And what did Mr Parish say?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.560
Did he deny it?

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.260
Did he say it couldn’t possibly have

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.460
been him, or that his colleague must

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.600
have been mistaken in what she saw?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.500
He didn’t, actually, but his

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.640
excuse wasn’t bought by everyone.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.180
He said that he was searching

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:49.050
for tractors, and had stumbled

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.680
across a pornography website,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.210
and he had continued to watch.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.790
He also admitted that he had watched

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.070
porn in the House of Commons a second

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.810
time, and that time he had skipped the

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.160
tractors and went straight for the porn.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.070
Although his boss, Boris Johnson, had

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.040
survived multiple scandals, some perhaps

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:14.300
even more saucy than this, it was too much

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.070
for Parish, and he was forced to resign

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.620
his position as member of parliament.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.670
He does still claim that he was

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.990
initially looking for tractors, and

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.750
I’ll leave you to decide whether

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.060
you believe him on that count.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.770
Our third political misbehaviour

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.580
story is a slightly darker one, but

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.320
it is important, and goes to show how

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.390
much this behaviour was tolerated in

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.980
Westminster, so much so that it has

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.640
been dubbed “Pestminster” by the press.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.800
In July of 2022, another Conservative

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.790
politician, a man named Chris Pincher,

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.020
was forced to resign after it emerged that

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.950
there were a whole range of accusations

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.080
of sexual assault against him dating

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.970
back 10 years, going back a decade.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.790
The culmination of all of this had been

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.380
the events of one evening, on the 30th of

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.030
June, when Pincher had gone to a private

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.410
club in an exclusive area of London, drunk

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.120
too much and sexually assaulted two men.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.250
Nasty stuff indeed, but it would

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.500
have far-reaching consequences.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.320
It turned out that Boris Johnson, the

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.030
then Prime Minister, knew all about

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.760
Pincher’s reputation, even joking that he

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.530
was “Pincher by name, pincher by nature”.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.050
If you are a pincher, by the way, it means

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.370
you grab or take something from someone

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.440
that you shouldn’t, or you touch them

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.530
inappropriately, without their permission.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.070
Anyway, Boris Johnson knew all

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.460
about Pincher’s reputation,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.810
yet he still appointed him to a

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.120
senior position in government.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.630
And this was the straw that broke

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.470
the camel’s back for Johnson, the

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.690
nail in the coffin in his tenure

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.481
as Prime Minister, and he was

00:12:59.481 --> 00:13:01.401
forced to resign a few days later.

00:13:02.311 --> 00:13:04.311
Now, you might be surprised to hear

00:13:04.491 --> 00:13:05.881
that we aren’t going to talk about

00:13:05.881 --> 00:13:07.721
Liz Truss at all in this episode.

00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:09.691
And that’s for two reasons.

00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:12.931
Firstly, it’s not completely unusual,

00:13:13.281 --> 00:13:15.511
and although there are plenty of unusual

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:17.851
and unexpected bits of her chaotic

00:13:17.861 --> 00:13:19.491
44 days in charge of the country,

00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:22.011
you probably know some of it already.

00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:24.571
And the second reason is that

00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:27.091
there is just so much to unpack,

00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:29.261
so we can’t do it justice in a

00:13:29.551 --> 00:13:31.351
small five minute section here.

00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:34.361
The good news is that we did just do

00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:37.391
an entire episode on the mad and tragic

00:13:37.401 --> 00:13:40.261
44 days of Liz Truss, so if you haven’t

00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:42.391
listened to that one already, then that

00:13:42.391 --> 00:13:45.021
one's for you, it’s episode number 327.

00:13:45.633 --> 00:13:48.463
Now, the final piece of unusual news

00:13:48.553 --> 00:13:50.403
is something that lots of people aren’t

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:53.579
aware of outside the UK, and many people

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:55.729
aren’t aware of even inside the UK.

00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:59.129
And this is related to the shifting

00:13:59.309 --> 00:14:01.769
demographics of the country, specifically,

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:04.979
the increasing multiculturalism of the UK.

00:14:06.099 --> 00:14:08.749
This isn’t “news”, in so much as

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:11.399
it's a gradual change, but there

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:13.509
are some important pieces of news

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:15.039
to mention that highlight the

00:14:15.419 --> 00:14:17.729
increasing diversity of the country.

00:14:18.789 --> 00:14:21.289
The first piece of “unusual news”

00:14:21.419 --> 00:14:23.119
is related to the publication of the

00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:26.479
results of the national Census, a big

00:14:26.489 --> 00:14:29.159
survey that is done of the UK population

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:31.989
every 10 years, which tries to answer

00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:34.339
questions like “how many people live

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:36.469
in the country?” and “who are they?”.

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:39.679
The results started to be published

00:14:39.689 --> 00:14:42.559
this year, and had, for some,

00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:44.899
surprising results, especially

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:46.959
with the fact that the UK has been

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:49.059
painted by many outside the country

00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:51.889
as anti-foreigner and anti-immigrant.

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:55.489
Of course, the Brexit vote gave people

00:14:55.489 --> 00:14:57.169
a pretty good reason to think that

00:14:57.169 --> 00:14:59.789
this was the case, but the results of

00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:01.829
the Census show that the country is

00:15:01.869 --> 00:15:03.779
different to what a lot of people think,

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:06.849
and it is indeed much more multicultural

00:15:06.849 --> 00:15:09.189
than many large European countries.

00:15:09.969 --> 00:15:12.099
So, it might surprise you to find

00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:15.629
out that one in every six people in

00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:18.459
England and Wales was born outside

00:15:18.569 --> 00:15:22.589
the UK, a 33% increase from 2011.

00:15:23.609 --> 00:15:25.749
If you’re interested, the top five

00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:28.661
countries were, in this order, India,

00:15:28.971 --> 00:15:32.051
Poland, Pakistan, Romania and Ireland.

00:15:33.091 --> 00:15:36.411
This non-UK born population is highly

00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:38.341
concentrated in the cities, which

00:15:38.551 --> 00:15:40.881
tend to be more multicultural places.

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:43.801
One area of London, for example,

00:15:44.131 --> 00:15:47.381
Brent, has 56% of its residents

00:15:47.521 --> 00:15:49.361
who were born outside the UK.

00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:52.901
Put simply, the UK is a lot more

00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:55.081
multicultural and multinational

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:56.711
than many people think it is.

00:15:57.881 --> 00:16:00.585
And this is particularly important when

00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:02.928
one remembers that in the summer of 2022,

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:05.685
the Prime Minister of the country was

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:08.085
chosen only by members of the Conservative

00:16:08.085 --> 00:16:10.395
Party, fewer than a hundred thousand

00:16:10.435 --> 00:16:13.205
people voted for Liz Truss, and these

00:16:13.225 --> 00:16:16.645
voters were overwhelmingly, 97%, white,

00:16:16.995 --> 00:16:19.645
over half of them were over 60, and they

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.865
lived primarily in the south of England.

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.025
Essentially, the Prime Minister was

00:16:25.025 --> 00:16:27.245
voted in by a tiny proportion of the

00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:29.700
country’s population, and a proportion

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.870
of the population that was utterly

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.650
unrepresentative of the real electorate.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.390
Now, as you’ll remember, the Prime

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:40.010
Minister that was chosen by the members

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.260
of the Conservative Party, Liz Truss,

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.240
didn’t do a very good job at all.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.420
Nevertheless, her tenure as Prime

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.470
Minister did break some records, and not

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.410
only for the shortest time in office.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.070
On September the 6th of this

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.230
year, when Liz Truss announced

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.480
her cabinet, a record was broken.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.890
It was the first time in British

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.990
history that the “Great Offices of

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.450
State” didn’t contain a white man.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.120
The “Great Offices of State” are the

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.180
most important political jobs in the

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.480
country: so that's the Prime Minister,

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.829
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:18.560
is basically the Minister of Finance, the

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.740
Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.210
Now, these politicians might have been

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.100
trailblazers in terms of who they were,

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.460
but they were still useless politicians

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.780
and they did huge damage to the country.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.870
As you may well know, after they were

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.170
booted out, the country then broke a

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.630
new record when it welcomed the first

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.960
non-white Prime Minister in the form of

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.850
Rishi Sunak, who has Indian heritage.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:48.045
And another fun-fact about Rishi Sunak

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.700
is that, at 42 years old, he was the

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.400
youngest Prime Minister in 200 years.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.780
Although Sunak might be representative

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.900
of the changing demographics of

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.920
the country, he has been criticised

00:18:01.132 --> 00:18:03.220
for being pretty unrepresentative

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.180
in almost every other way.

00:18:06.493 --> 00:18:08.623
Specifically, his bank balance

00:18:08.653 --> 00:18:11.053
certainly is not representative of

00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:12.773
the average person in the country.

00:18:13.653 --> 00:18:15.693
When his wife’s fortune is taken

00:18:15.693 --> 00:18:18.213
into account, Sunak holds the record

00:18:18.373 --> 00:18:20.303
for being the richest ever British

00:18:20.323 --> 00:18:22.163
Prime Minister, with a combined

00:18:22.163 --> 00:18:24.883
fortune of almost a billion Euros.

00:18:26.303 --> 00:18:28.023
So, there you have it,

00:18:28.143 --> 00:18:30.712
the unusual news of 2022.

00:18:31.183 --> 00:18:33.783
This year the UK has broken records

00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:35.853
for the longest monarch, the world’s

00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:37.733
longest-serving female monarch, the

00:18:37.923 --> 00:18:39.843
richest Prime Minister, the youngest

00:18:39.853 --> 00:18:41.953
Prime Minister, the shortest-serving

00:18:41.953 --> 00:18:44.413
Prime Minister, it’s broken multicultural

00:18:44.413 --> 00:18:46.683
records, it has seen some extremely

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:48.753
bad behaviour from politicians, and

00:18:48.913 --> 00:18:51.453
last but not least, some exceptional

00:18:51.463 --> 00:18:53.862
detective work from footballer’s wives.

00:18:56.262 --> 00:18:58.933
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:01.523
on The Unusual British News of 2022.

00:19:01.903 --> 00:19:03.343
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:05.393
and whether it’s footballers’ wives,

00:19:05.493 --> 00:19:07.243
naughty politicians or the changing

00:19:07.253 --> 00:19:08.803
make-up of the country, that you've

00:19:08.803 --> 00:19:10.713

00:19:16.643 --> 00:19:18.393
UK that you remember from this year?

00:19:18.843 --> 00:19:20.353

queen’s death was covered in your country?

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:24.333

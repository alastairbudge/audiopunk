Hello, hello hello, and welcome

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.569
to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.559
Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.490
The show where you can listen to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.960
fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.259
and wonderful things about the world at

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.500
the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.810
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.669
to be talking about Hostage Negotiations.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.150
This subject is actually

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.750
going to be told in two parts.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.990
In this episode, part one, we will

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.650
tell the story of two shocking hostage

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.770
crises in the early nineteen seventies,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.170
one in Florida, in the United States

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.610
and the other in Munich, in Germany.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.150
And in part two, we will look at how the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.769
strange world of hostage negotiations has

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.140
developed since then, and look at some

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.210
of the strategies and techniques that

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.210
law enforcement agencies use to negotiate

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.910
with people in a life or death situation.

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:04.646
Ok then, hostage negotiations.

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:07.246
Think of the last time you had

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:08.516
a conversation with someone.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.016
How much of the meaning you both

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:13.926
conveyed was contained in non-verbal

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.706
cues like tone of voice and movement?

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:19.296
Psychologists would tell

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:21.136
you that it was a lot.

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:25.136
If subtle signals like this matter

00:01:25.136 --> 00:01:27.266
in ordinary conversation, they

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:30.236
matter tenfold in the life-or-death

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:32.766
scenario of hostage negotiations.

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:35.386
Hostage negotiations are the most

00:01:35.386 --> 00:01:37.536
nerve-wracking incidents that a

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:39.346
law enforcement team can face.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.256
The hostage taker may have

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.506
weapons, threaten violence, and

00:01:43.706 --> 00:01:45.966
be determined to follow through.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.676
The police may have more manpower

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:50.876
and weapons than the hostage-taker,

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:53.726
but these capabilities are useless

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.896
when the perpetrators could harm

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:57.926
their victims at any moment.

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.066
The negotiator must rely on words,

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:03.596
tone, and body language to work

00:02:03.626 --> 00:02:05.756
towards a peaceful resolution.

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:09.576
And while “peaceful resolutions” are more

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:12.186
common than ever, even a matter of 50

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:15.426
years ago this was certainly not the case.

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:17.966
Police used to resort to force

00:02:18.156 --> 00:02:20.646
much more quickly, and the results

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:22.656
were often not very pretty.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.286
One major US hostage crisis in 1971

00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:30.686
highlighted the dangers of this strategy.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:36.146
At 1.30 am on October the 3rd 1971,

00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:38.766
in Nashville, Tennessee, a pilot

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:42.136
named Brent Downs waited on the runway

00:02:42.326 --> 00:02:44.726
next to a private charter plane.

00:02:45.896 --> 00:02:48.006
He was due to fly three

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:50.566
passengers to Atlanta, Georgia.

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:53.266
He stood on the tarmac

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.336
ready to greet them.

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:57.626
The three passengers finally arrived

00:02:57.636 --> 00:02:59.956
on the runway and approached the plane.

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:03.596
One of them was George Giffe, the

00:03:03.726 --> 00:03:05.466
man who had booked the flight.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:07.886
He was accompanied by his

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:10.746
estranged wife Susan Giffe and a

00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:12.916
man called Bobby Wayne Wallace.

00:03:14.096 --> 00:03:16.606
Downs and his co-pilot struck up a

00:03:16.636 --> 00:03:19.596
conversation with Giffe, while Susan Giffe

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:22.436
and the other man waited 100 metres away.

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:24.926
Giffe and his companions

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.546
seemed ordinary enough.

00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:29.946
That was until the woman – Susan - began

00:03:29.956 --> 00:03:33.046
screaming that she was being kidnapped.

00:03:33.976 --> 00:03:36.226
Downs, the pilot, was concerned

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:37.376
and walked towards her.

00:03:37.946 --> 00:03:39.376
George Giffe assured him

00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:40.606
that nothing was wrong.

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:42.986
The screaming woman was a mental

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:45.036
patient having a crisis, he said,

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:47.386
and he was her doctor taking

00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:49.176
her to Atlanta for treatment.

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:52.536
Downs was still suspicious.

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:55.096
He asked Giffe for proof of his identity.

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:58.086
At this point, Giffe turned a

00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:00.356
pistol, a gun, on the pilot.

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.506
He claimed he had a bomb.

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:06.016
He and Wallace forced Downs and Susan

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:09.076
into the aircraft and ordered Downs,

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:11.356
the pilot, to quickly take off.

00:04:12.696 --> 00:04:15.876
With no other option, the pilot took to

00:04:15.906 --> 00:04:19.096
the air, with Giffe, his estranged wife,

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:21.646
and the third man, Bobby Wayne Wallace.

00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:26.446
The ground crew quickly alerted the FBI.

00:04:27.206 --> 00:04:28.516
When the plane was in the air,

00:04:28.876 --> 00:04:31.386
Giffe told Downs to change course

00:04:31.396 --> 00:04:33.116
from Atlanta to the Bahamas.

00:04:33.756 --> 00:04:36.646
Downs protested, saying that he would need

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:38.986
to refuel in Jacksonville, in Florida.

00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:41.636
It was a small plane, and there simply

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:43.946
wasn’t enough fuel to go all the way.

00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:47.876
Giffe agreed and Downs called ahead to

00:04:47.876 --> 00:04:50.306
the airport at Jacksonville to prepare

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:53.296
charts, fuel, and flotation gear.

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:58.156
At 5.08 am, the aircraft landed

00:04:58.206 --> 00:04:59.506
at Jacksonville, Florida,

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.816
where the FBI was waiting.

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:05.736
During the flight, the FBI had learned

00:05:05.746 --> 00:05:07.636
that George Giffe and Bobby Wayne

00:05:07.776 --> 00:05:10.636
Wallace had kidnapped Susan, Giffe’s

00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:13.256
estranged wife, as she left for work.

00:05:14.556 --> 00:05:16.656
When the plane landed, the pilot

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:19.044
radioed the tower saying that the

00:05:19.044 --> 00:05:21.784
hostage takers were armed with handguns.

00:05:22.504 --> 00:05:25.674
Giffe claimed to have over 5 kilos

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:27.754
of explosives in his luggage.

00:05:28.464 --> 00:05:31.204
Now, the FBI’s priority was to

00:05:31.204 --> 00:05:33.014
keep the plane on the ground.

00:05:33.744 --> 00:05:36.274
Although this was a prudent strategy,

00:05:36.534 --> 00:05:38.854
as it’s clearly easier to negotiate

00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:40.154
with someone if they’re in the

00:05:40.154 --> 00:05:41.935
same place, not up in an aeroplane,

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.714
the FBI soon made its first error.

00:05:46.934 --> 00:05:48.894
Almost immediately after the plane had

00:05:48.894 --> 00:05:52.674
landed, the primary FBI negotiator J.J.

00:05:52.674 --> 00:05:54.304
O’Connor radioed the

00:05:54.304 --> 00:05:55.764
hostage takers on the plane.

00:05:56.404 --> 00:05:58.714
He refused to give the hostage

00:05:58.714 --> 00:06:00.524
takers the fuel they demanded.

00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:04.654
This flat-out refusal of a key hostage

00:06:04.654 --> 00:06:07.114
demand closed any possibility of

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:09.214
compromise between the agents and

00:06:09.214 --> 00:06:11.914
Giffe, and ended lines of communication.

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:15.344
Even the pilot, Brent Downs, knew

00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:17.754
how dangerous O’Connor’s refusal was.

00:06:18.234 --> 00:06:21.444
In archived footage from the tense 6-

00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:24.044
minute standoff, Downs gave the FBI

00:06:24.044 --> 00:06:26.958
a fearful warning, saying: “You’re

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:28.584
endangering lives by doing this”.

00:06:29.604 --> 00:06:31.404
A few minutes later, Giffe’s

00:06:31.454 --> 00:06:33.604
accomplice, Wallace, left the

00:06:33.604 --> 00:06:36.014
plane voluntarily and was arrested.

00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:39.224
According to commentators after

00:06:39.224 --> 00:06:41.324
the event, the FBI should have

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.294
taken this as a small victory.

00:06:43.764 --> 00:06:46.054
They could have leveraged the departure

00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:48.284
of Giffe’s accomplice and used it

00:06:48.444 --> 00:06:50.684
to convince Giffe to surrender.

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:54.544
Instead, the FBI chose a

00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:55.954
different course of action.

00:06:56.694 --> 00:07:00.304
At 5.27 am, the primary negotiator

00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:02.684
ordered his agents to shoot.

00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:05.304
Bullets pierced the tyres

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:06.594
of the plane as well as the

00:07:06.594 --> 00:07:08.184
engine, which was still running.

00:07:09.174 --> 00:07:12.474
As soon as the firearms went off, what

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:14.834
was a tense and dangerous situation

00:07:15.194 --> 00:07:17.214
tipped over into a deadly one.

00:07:18.374 --> 00:07:20.704
Shots were heard inside the plane.

00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:23.394
Giffe had shot dead the

00:07:23.394 --> 00:07:26.094
pilot, his wife, and himself.

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:29.984
It later turned out that Giffe had been

00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:32.824
suffering from a mental health episode.

00:07:33.284 --> 00:07:35.304
A few years afterwards, the wife

00:07:35.334 --> 00:07:38.064
of the dead pilot sued the FBI for

00:07:38.064 --> 00:07:40.214
creating a deadly situation that

00:07:40.214 --> 00:07:42.024
could have been peacefully resolved.

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:44.974
She won on appeal, and it was

00:07:44.974 --> 00:07:47.444
the first time ever that the FBI

00:07:47.454 --> 00:07:49.694
has been sued in a civil suit.

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:53.534
The tragic outcome of this Florida

00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:56.974
hijacking underlined how inadequate the

00:07:56.984 --> 00:07:59.184
law enforcement agencies were when it

00:07:59.184 --> 00:08:02.004
came to saving lives in a hostage crisis.

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:04.444
They simply didn’t know what to do,

00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:07.104
and thought that by firing at the

00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:09.924
aeroplane Giffe, the man with the gun,

00:08:09.934 --> 00:08:12.034
would be frightened into surrendering.

00:08:12.904 --> 00:08:14.294
Clearly, he wasn’t.

00:08:14.864 --> 00:08:17.204
The shots tipped him over the edge,

00:08:17.254 --> 00:08:19.444
and cost the lives of three people.

00:08:20.524 --> 00:08:23.614
Less than a year later, a very different

00:08:23.774 --> 00:08:25.964
international hostage event finally

00:08:25.974 --> 00:08:27.794
shocked law enforcement around the

00:08:27.794 --> 00:08:30.064
world into taking the psychological

00:08:30.094 --> 00:08:32.364
aspects of negotiation seriously.

00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:37.244
This was the 1972 hostage crisis at the

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:39.604
Munich Olympic Games in West Germany.

00:08:40.024 --> 00:08:42.394
A serious hostage crisis that the

00:08:42.394 --> 00:08:45.484
world watched played out on live TV.

00:08:46.464 --> 00:08:48.854
The attack was organised by Black

00:08:48.884 --> 00:08:51.694
September, an anti-Israeli terrorist

00:08:51.704 --> 00:08:53.444
organisation fighting for the

00:08:53.444 --> 00:08:55.694
cause of Palestinian liberation.

00:08:56.664 --> 00:08:59.164
Unlike the Florida hijacking, the motives

00:08:59.194 --> 00:09:02.194
of the perpetrators were political and

00:09:02.324 --> 00:09:04.814
their demands were clear and rigid.

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.944
Like in the United States, the

00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:10.384
German authorities did not have

00:09:10.394 --> 00:09:12.564
a systemic set of procedures for

00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:14.444
handling hostage crises at the time.

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:19.324
In hindsight, this was perhaps surprising,

00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:21.764
given how politically turbulent the

00:09:21.764 --> 00:09:23.684
late sixties and early seventies were.

00:09:24.157 --> 00:09:26.284
There were tensions over the war

00:09:26.284 --> 00:09:28.354
in Vietnam, nationalism in the

00:09:28.354 --> 00:09:30.194
developing world that met pushback

00:09:30.204 --> 00:09:32.784
from imperial nations, and the growth

00:09:32.904 --> 00:09:35.454
of both right and left wing extremism.

00:09:36.234 --> 00:09:38.214
Terror groups cultivated global

00:09:38.214 --> 00:09:40.894
networks to train, recruit, and

00:09:40.894 --> 00:09:42.514
raise funds for their causes.

00:09:43.564 --> 00:09:46.414
One of the sources of extremism was the

00:09:46.414 --> 00:09:50.154
1967 brutal war between Egypt and Israel.

00:09:51.134 --> 00:09:53.874
It started after Israel was blocked by

00:09:53.914 --> 00:09:56.264
Egypt from using a key shipping route.

00:09:57.044 --> 00:09:59.499
What followed became known as the 6 Day

00:09:59.644 --> 00:10:02.854
War, and resulted in Israel capturing

00:10:02.864 --> 00:10:05.264
a lot of territory, including Gaza,

00:10:05.364 --> 00:10:07.454
the West Bank, and the Golan Heights.

00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:10.244
It also resulted in the capture

00:10:10.374 --> 00:10:12.144
of thousands of prisoners, the

00:10:12.294 --> 00:10:14.844
displacement of around 300,000

00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:17.254
Palestinians, and no simple

00:10:17.394 --> 00:10:19.504
diplomatic solution to the situation.

00:10:20.934 --> 00:10:23.714
For some Palestinian militant groups, the

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:25.904
only way they thought they could weaken

00:10:26.074 --> 00:10:28.614
Israel would be through terror tactics.

00:10:29.214 --> 00:10:31.264
And although they had been targeting

00:10:31.394 --> 00:10:33.434
Israel before the war, they were

00:10:33.444 --> 00:10:35.564
now ready to organise international

00:10:35.594 --> 00:10:37.074
attacks that could bring the

00:10:37.074 --> 00:10:39.154
world’s attention to their cause.

00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:45.324
So, in July 1972, two men, Abu Iyad and

00:10:45.374 --> 00:10:48.524
Ali Hassan Salameh, met in a café in Rome.

00:10:49.294 --> 00:10:51.054
They were leaders of the militant

00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:54.074
Palestinian group, Black September, and

00:10:54.224 --> 00:10:57.034
it was then that they decided to target

00:10:57.054 --> 00:10:59.444
the upcoming Olympic Games in Munich.

00:11:01.014 --> 00:11:03.014
Abu Iyah was the one who first

00:11:03.024 --> 00:11:04.704
proposed kidnapping Israeli

00:11:04.734 --> 00:11:06.854
athletes to force Israel to

00:11:06.864 --> 00:11:08.814
release Palestinians from prison.

00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:11.754
They selected seven other young

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:13.864
men to carry out the attack, all

00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:16.084
Palestinian refugees from camps

00:11:16.124 --> 00:11:18.294
in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.

00:11:19.764 --> 00:11:21.814
For weeks before the Olympic games

00:11:21.824 --> 00:11:24.364
started, the men infiltrated the

00:11:24.374 --> 00:11:26.594
Olympic village to understand its

00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:28.574
layout and security weaknesses.

00:11:29.464 --> 00:11:31.994
Some even got jobs there, giving them

00:11:32.164 --> 00:11:34.644
full undercover access to the site.

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:38.494
The Games began on the 26th of August.

00:11:39.074 --> 00:11:40.404
On the 5th of September,

00:11:40.684 --> 00:11:42.214
the terrorists were ready.

00:11:43.094 --> 00:11:45.904
At 4.30 in the morning they snuck

00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:49.274
into 31 Connollystrasse, the apartment

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:51.334
block where the Israeli delegation

00:11:51.484 --> 00:11:53.124
to the Olympic Games were staying.

00:11:54.014 --> 00:11:54.974
They approached apartment

00:11:54.974 --> 00:11:57.964
1, which housed 7 Israelis.

00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:01.374
An Israeli wrestler, Yossef

00:12:01.434 --> 00:12:02.764
Gutfrend, was among them.

00:12:03.464 --> 00:12:05.054
He was the first to notice

00:12:05.054 --> 00:12:05.974
that something was wrong.

00:12:06.344 --> 00:12:08.744
He heard noises outside the door

00:12:08.784 --> 00:12:11.094
and watched as it opened slightly.

00:12:12.034 --> 00:12:13.474
Beyond it, he glimpsed

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:15.024
a group of armed men.

00:12:15.704 --> 00:12:17.794
He shouted to warn his roommates

00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:20.304
and threw himself against the door.

00:12:21.464 --> 00:12:23.064
He might have been an Olympic

00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:26.554
wrestler weighing 135kg, but he

00:12:26.554 --> 00:12:28.924
was no match for 8 armed men.

00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:31.734
The terrorists overpowered him

00:12:31.764 --> 00:12:33.074
and forced him to the floor.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.284
From there, the eight terrorists swept the

00:12:37.284 --> 00:12:40.174
building, bedroom by bedroom, until they

00:12:40.184 --> 00:12:43.304
had eleven Israeli athletes held hostage.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:45.974
Shots were fired and the

00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:47.644
village started waking up.

00:12:48.374 --> 00:12:50.974
At 5 am, the Munich chief of police

00:12:51.084 --> 00:12:53.534
was aware of a disaster unfolding

00:12:53.684 --> 00:12:54.974
within the Olympic Village.

00:12:55.594 --> 00:12:57.574
Soon, the whole world would be

00:12:57.574 --> 00:12:59.934
transfixed on Building number 3

00:13:00.204 --> 00:13:01.884
of Connollystrasse, in Munich.

00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:05.294
Around a billion viewers tuned in

00:13:05.294 --> 00:13:07.404
that day to watch the Olympic Park

00:13:07.424 --> 00:13:09.514
crisis unfold on their screens.

00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:12.714
The terrorists knew they had captured the

00:13:12.714 --> 00:13:14.434
attention of the international community,

00:13:14.614 --> 00:13:16.944
which is precisely what they had wanted.

00:13:18.164 --> 00:13:20.464
They announced their demand and deadline.

00:13:20.834 --> 00:13:22.904
The Israeli government must

00:13:22.924 --> 00:13:24.904
release Palestinian terrorists

00:13:24.954 --> 00:13:28.714
from jail by 9:00 AM or they would

00:13:28.714 --> 00:13:30.904
start to execute the hostages.

00:13:31.884 --> 00:13:34.454
With only a few hours to comply,

00:13:34.674 --> 00:13:36.244
there was no time to waste.

00:13:37.144 --> 00:13:39.504
But the German police and security

00:13:39.714 --> 00:13:42.644
services were woefully unprepared,

00:13:42.904 --> 00:13:45.594
they simply weren’t ready, and despite

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:48.004
the frequent terror hostage incidents

00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:50.194
over the early seventies, the security

00:13:50.194 --> 00:13:53.284
services were always one step behind.

00:13:53.804 --> 00:13:56.054
There was no armed security or

00:13:56.064 --> 00:13:57.934
checkpoints at the Munich games.

00:13:58.484 --> 00:14:00.784
The institutional make-up of German

00:14:00.784 --> 00:14:03.524
security was also badly equipped to

00:14:03.524 --> 00:14:04.944
deal with this sort of situation.

00:14:05.834 --> 00:14:08.894
In Germany, power is divided among 16

00:14:08.904 --> 00:14:11.134
states, each with its own government.

00:14:11.484 --> 00:14:14.254
There was no central federal agency

00:14:14.344 --> 00:14:16.524
responsible for organising negotiations

00:14:16.544 --> 00:14:18.764
efforts, which is critical in a siege

00:14:18.764 --> 00:14:20.494
of such international importance.

00:14:21.424 --> 00:14:24.424
Instead of federal personnel, Munich

00:14:24.454 --> 00:14:27.064
police chief Manfred Schreiber and the

00:14:27.064 --> 00:14:29.674
interior minister of Bavaria state, Bruno

00:14:29.704 --> 00:14:32.614
Merk, were chosen as primary negotiators

00:14:32.774 --> 00:14:34.784
who would communicate with the terrorists.

00:14:35.664 --> 00:14:37.874
Appointing the most senior state police

00:14:37.874 --> 00:14:40.524
chief as negotiator was, as it would

00:14:40.594 --> 00:14:43.044
later transpire, a serious mistake.

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:46.564
Nowadays, a key principle of hostage

00:14:46.564 --> 00:14:49.684
negotiation is to appoint a non-senior

00:14:49.684 --> 00:14:52.144
member that specialises in hostage

00:14:52.154 --> 00:14:54.404
dialogue as the primary negotiator.

00:14:55.284 --> 00:14:58.004
This is because a subordinate officer, a

00:14:58.154 --> 00:15:01.354
more junior official, can buy more time

00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:04.624
by blaming a higher authority for delays

00:15:04.624 --> 00:15:06.474
in delivering the terrorists’ demands.

00:15:07.254 --> 00:15:09.904
As we’ll see in part two, blaming

00:15:09.944 --> 00:15:11.964
other people to buy time is an

00:15:11.964 --> 00:15:13.934
important part of hostage negotiation.

00:15:15.814 --> 00:15:18.683
Fifteen minutes before the 9 am deadline

00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:21.146
for Israel to release prisoners, nothing

00:15:21.296 --> 00:15:23.446
had been done to resolve the situation.

00:15:24.246 --> 00:15:27.146
At the last moment, the German authorities

00:15:27.326 --> 00:15:29.816
sent Olympic delegates from Arab

00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:32.236
nations as negotiators for the hostages.

00:15:33.206 --> 00:15:35.446
The Egyptian who was chosen for this

00:15:35.596 --> 00:15:37.946
appealed to the hostage takers to give

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:40.316
the Israelis and Germans more time.

00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:43.346
The plan worked and the

00:15:43.346 --> 00:15:45.626
terrorists agreed to extend the

00:15:45.626 --> 00:15:48.036
deadline to noon, midday, 12pm.

00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:52.046
But then came the next glaring

00:15:52.096 --> 00:15:53.856
error in the German response.

00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:56.626
The Munich police chief Manfred

00:15:56.626 --> 00:15:59.596
Schreiber offered the terrorists $9

00:15:59.596 --> 00:16:02.206
million dollars to release the hostages.

00:16:02.806 --> 00:16:04.956
It’s over $60 million dollars in

00:16:04.956 --> 00:16:07.266
today’s money, an enormous sum.

00:16:08.016 --> 00:16:09.696
But offering this amount of

00:16:09.696 --> 00:16:12.746
money reflected how badly the

00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:14.326
authorities understood the

00:16:14.326 --> 00:16:16.106
motives of the hostage takers.

00:16:16.956 --> 00:16:19.476
In a terror hostage crisis where the

00:16:19.476 --> 00:16:22.036
demands are political, perpetrators

00:16:22.036 --> 00:16:23.806
are typically more committed

00:16:23.996 --> 00:16:25.466
to their political objectives

00:16:25.486 --> 00:16:27.266
than preserving their own lives.

00:16:27.826 --> 00:16:30.336
A monetary offer can also imply

00:16:30.506 --> 00:16:31.926
that the authorities believe the

00:16:31.936 --> 00:16:34.336
terrorists can simply be paid to

00:16:34.336 --> 00:16:35.766
give up their political demands.

00:16:36.296 --> 00:16:38.676
This risks offending the perpetrators

00:16:38.696 --> 00:16:41.486
and inflaming the situation further.

00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:44.386
This was certainly the case

00:16:44.496 --> 00:16:45.586
with the Munich crisis.

00:16:46.046 --> 00:16:48.236
The terrorists didn’t want money, they

00:16:48.346 --> 00:16:50.326
wanted their political demands to be

00:16:50.326 --> 00:16:52.856
met, for the prisoners to be released.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.796
Israel would not give in to the

00:16:55.796 --> 00:16:57.996
terrorists’ demands but the German

00:16:58.016 --> 00:17:00.116
authorities had to convince the

00:17:00.116 --> 00:17:02.046
terrorists otherwise, to stop

00:17:02.076 --> 00:17:03.816
them from killing the hostages.

00:17:05.036 --> 00:17:07.126
They sent the Tunisian ambassador

00:17:07.286 --> 00:17:09.276
to West Germany to beg the

00:17:09.276 --> 00:17:11.146
terrorists to give Israel more time.

00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:14.526
They agreed to a 5 pm deadline.

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:19.526
At 4.35 p.m., Issa, the leader of the

00:17:19.526 --> 00:17:21.986
terrorists, demanded that the hostage

00:17:21.986 --> 00:17:24.766
takers, along with their Israeli hostages,

00:17:25.046 --> 00:17:27.376
should be flown to Cairo in Egypt.

00:17:28.416 --> 00:17:30.526
The Germans agreed to this and

00:17:30.526 --> 00:17:33.296
said a plane would be ready by 7pm.

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:37.356
The airfield chosen was called

00:17:37.586 --> 00:17:39.806
Furstenfeldbruck and the terrorists

00:17:39.836 --> 00:17:42.446
agreed to be flown there by helicopters

00:17:42.706 --> 00:17:45.616
piloted by two Germans and a German crew.

00:17:46.926 --> 00:17:49.126
The Germans never planned for the

00:17:49.266 --> 00:17:51.716
hostage takers and their hostages to

00:17:51.716 --> 00:17:54.006
reach Cairo, their chosen destination.

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:56.836
Unknown to the terrorists, the

00:17:56.836 --> 00:17:58.876
Egyptian government was refusing

00:17:58.876 --> 00:18:00.856
to allow them to land in Egypt.

00:18:01.626 --> 00:18:03.246
The Israelis did not want the

00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:05.156
hostages to fly to Egypt either.

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:08.246
Instead, the Germans planned to

00:18:08.246 --> 00:18:11.146
rescue the hostages on the airfield

00:18:11.376 --> 00:18:13.266
as their captors approached the plane.

00:18:14.136 --> 00:18:16.156
The helicopters carrying the hostage

00:18:16.156 --> 00:18:18.966
takers and their hostages landed at

00:18:18.966 --> 00:18:22.096
Fürstenfeldbruck airfield at 10:40 pm.

00:18:23.196 --> 00:18:25.356
By then it was dark and the

00:18:25.366 --> 00:18:27.416
airstrip was lit in floodlights.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:31.586
The German authorities had imposed a media

00:18:31.666 --> 00:18:34.356
blackout on the Fürstenfeldbruck airfield.

00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:36.996
This was their final chance

00:18:37.156 --> 00:18:38.756
to save the Israelis.

00:18:39.926 --> 00:18:42.776
Five snipers, people expert at

00:18:42.776 --> 00:18:44.806
shooting from a long distance, had

00:18:44.806 --> 00:18:47.056
been positioned around the airfield,

00:18:47.346 --> 00:18:49.216
invisible to the terrorists.

00:18:50.176 --> 00:18:52.446
Shockingly, none of them were given

00:18:52.636 --> 00:18:54.656
walkie talkies, meaning that they

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.776
could not coordinate with one another.

00:18:57.846 --> 00:18:59.476
Other critical items were

00:18:59.486 --> 00:19:01.006
missing from their toolkits.

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:03.616
They did not have bulletproof vests

00:19:03.636 --> 00:19:07.049
or helmets, and none had infrared or

00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:09.646
telescopic sights fitted on their guns.

00:19:10.386 --> 00:19:12.076
They were in the dark,

00:19:12.336 --> 00:19:14.126
literally and metaphorically.

00:19:15.876 --> 00:19:18.906
When Issa and his deputy Yusuf Nazzal

00:19:19.236 --> 00:19:21.046
stepped out of the helicopters to

00:19:21.216 --> 00:19:23.306
check their plane, they quickly

00:19:23.326 --> 00:19:25.496
became suspicious it was a trap and

00:19:25.646 --> 00:19:28.286
started to run back to the helicopter.

00:19:29.356 --> 00:19:31.976
At that moment, the snipers began

00:19:31.976 --> 00:19:34.466
firing, shooting two terrorists

00:19:34.626 --> 00:19:35.996
guarding the helicopter pilots.

00:19:36.896 --> 00:19:38.966
Next, the snipers fired

00:19:38.966 --> 00:19:40.306
on Issa and Nazzal.

00:19:41.406 --> 00:19:44.456
Issa was hit but managed to crawl back

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:47.066
to the helicopters, where he began firing

00:19:47.176 --> 00:19:49.316
out into the dark with his machine gun.

00:19:50.176 --> 00:19:52.296
At this point, all the terrorists

00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:54.446
started shooting at the snipers

00:19:54.456 --> 00:19:56.196
from the cover of the helicopter.

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:58.116
The scene was chaos.

00:19:58.336 --> 00:20:00.616
Nobody could tell which shots

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:02.326
were being fired by whom.

00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.846
The small team of five snipers could

00:20:05.856 --> 00:20:08.246
do nothing to disarm the terrorists.

00:20:08.746 --> 00:20:10.986
The firefight lasted for ten

00:20:10.986 --> 00:20:12.626
minutes before the Germans

00:20:12.626 --> 00:20:13.976
called for armoured backup.

00:20:14.966 --> 00:20:16.466
Until they arrived, there

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.306
was nothing to do but watch.

00:20:19.396 --> 00:20:21.556
In all, one German officer was

00:20:21.556 --> 00:20:23.456
killed, several were injured,

00:20:23.706 --> 00:20:25.496
and five terrorists were killed.

00:20:26.696 --> 00:20:28.516
After the rescue operation came

00:20:28.516 --> 00:20:30.886
the final anguish for the loved

00:20:30.886 --> 00:20:33.196
ones of the hostages, who had been

00:20:33.236 --> 00:20:35.826
anxiously waiting, watching the news.

00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:39.596
The media outlet Reuters reported at

00:20:39.596 --> 00:20:43.496
12.30 pm that all hostages had survived.

00:20:44.016 --> 00:20:44.866
What a triumph!

00:20:45.816 --> 00:20:47.786
Unfortunately, it was wrong.

00:20:48.846 --> 00:20:51.116
After three hours, Reuters

00:20:51.326 --> 00:20:52.446
corrected their report.

00:20:53.796 --> 00:20:57.516
All the hostages, 11 Israelis, were lying

00:20:57.516 --> 00:21:00.056
dead on this dark, German, airfield.

00:21:01.136 --> 00:21:03.496
It would remain a black mark on

00:21:03.496 --> 00:21:05.026
the German security services’

00:21:05.026 --> 00:21:07.236
reputation for years to come.

00:21:08.566 --> 00:21:11.386
Now, even though most countries do have

00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:14.346
an explicit policy of “not negotiating

00:21:14.346 --> 00:21:16.336
with terrorists”, it was clear that

00:21:16.336 --> 00:21:19.676
Munich had been an unmitigated disaster.

00:21:20.356 --> 00:21:22.766
And while everything is easy with

00:21:22.766 --> 00:21:24.836
the benefit of hindsight, security

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:27.166
forces across the globe started to

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:29.846
develop systems and best practices

00:21:30.026 --> 00:21:31.846
for what should have been done.

00:21:32.486 --> 00:21:34.776
Systems and practices that we will discuss

00:21:35.086 --> 00:21:37.456
in detail in part two, the next episode,

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:39.376
where we will look at the question of

00:21:39.656 --> 00:21:42.156
“How To Negotiate With Hostage Takers”

00:21:44.246 --> 00:21:47.176
OK then, that is it for today's episode

00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:50.146
on The Florida & Munich Hostage Disasters.

00:21:50.386 --> 00:21:51.776
I hope it's been an interesting one,

00:21:52.066 --> 00:21:53.646
and that you've learnt something new.

00:21:55.956 --> 00:21:57.206
what you thought of this episode.

00:21:57.626 --> 00:21:59.016
I imagine you might have known

00:21:59.196 --> 00:22:00.716
about the Munich Massacre, but

00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:02.606
were you aware of what happened

00:22:02.606 --> 00:22:04.366
on another airfield in Florida?

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:06.566
What do you think the hostage

00:22:06.566 --> 00:22:07.956
negotiators got wrong?

00:22:08.316 --> 00:22:10.196
How should they have acted differently?

00:22:10.766 --> 00:22:11.986
I would love to know.

00:22:12.156 --> 00:22:13.226

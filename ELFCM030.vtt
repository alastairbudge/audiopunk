Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.250
English.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.610
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.590
Today we are going to be talking about the most infamous serial killer in British history, Jack The

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.190
Ripper.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.225
In 1888, over the period of about two and a half months, London's East End was terrorized by the

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:40.095
gruesome killings of young women at the hands of a killer nicknamed Jack The Ripper.

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:47.455
To this day, we don't know who he really was, although you'll have to wait until the end of the

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:51.265
podcast for the identities of some of the suspects.

00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:56.875
Before we get right into it though, I just have two little things to say.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.515
Firstly, today's podcast is obviously about a serial killer, and so if you happen to be listening

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:10.185
with children nearby or if you just don't want to listen to something where we'll be talking about

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:15.315
some quite nasty murders, then now is probably a good time to press pause.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:22.455
Secondly, regular listeners will know that the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast can be

00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:25.895
found on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:32.850
We also just recently launched our animating transcripts, which are kind of like subtitles for

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.610
podcasts, but way cooler because you can press on a word and find out its definition.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.620
So that's definitely worth checking out if you haven't done so already, and that's at

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.890
leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.270
Okay then, public service announcements over.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.450
The year is 1888 and we're in Victorian London's infamous East End.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.400
To say that life in London's East End was rough in 1888 would be an understatement.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.390
It was overcrowded after an influx of immigrants from Ireland, Russia, and Eastern Europe had come

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.650
to seek a better life and escape persecution.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.120
But living conditions were absolutely atrocious.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.050
Over 50% of children born in the East End of London died before they were five years old.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.370
Violent crimes were frequent and alcoholism was rife.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:46.455
Poverty was widespread, and this ended up driving many women to prostitution.

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:55.015
Just in the Whitechapel area alone, the Whitechapel area of East London, there were 62 known

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:59.665
brothels and 1,200 women working as prostitutes.

00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:09.925
Crime against these women was commonplace and abuse at the hands of men was an unfortunate reality

00:03:10.045 --> 00:03:17.125
for the prostitutes working in the area, and it wasn't often reported to police or reported in the

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:17.605
press.

00:03:19.888 --> 00:03:29.135
However, on Friday the 31st of August 1888 something happened that was evidently pretty different to

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:29.585
the norm.

00:03:31.955 --> 00:03:40.265
A woman named Mary Ann Nichols was found dead, brutally murdered, her throat and her lower abdomen,

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:42.845
her stomach, cut in horrible ways.

00:03:44.327 --> 00:03:50.427
I'm not going to go into all of the gory details because, well, they are pretty gory, pretty nasty.

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:56.644
Suffice it to say that it was clearly the work of a sadistic individual.

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:05.104
Then through September, October, and November, the bodies kept on appearing.

00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:13.624
Women murdered in a similar way in the middle of the night, the killer's signature move, the things

00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:19.864
that linked the killings, was the way in which their throats were cut and the fact that their

00:04:19.864 --> 00:04:24.634
stomachs were often brutally cut, pretty horrible stuff.

00:04:26.064 --> 00:04:32.904
It's thought that one person was responsible for the killings of at least five of these women,

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:35.424
perhaps as much as 11.

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:44.029
They had all been killed in a similar gruesome way within about one mile of each other, over the

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:46.819
course of this two and a half month period.

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:51.806
But there was no sign of the killer.

00:04:53.186 --> 00:05:02.536
The time that these murders took place coincided with a boom in cheap newspapers, which one would

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:09.796
probably say were a mixture of news and fiction, they certainly embellished the news.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:19.911
And they seized upon the Jack The Ripper case, publishing all of the gory details to a public that

00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:26.961
was following this horrible murder investigation in real time as the bodies continued to pile up.

00:05:28.384 --> 00:05:36.484
At the height of the investigation, over 1 million newspapers relating to the case were sold each

00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:36.934
day.

00:05:38.255 --> 00:05:45.451
The journalists would also try lots of tricks to boost the circulation of their newspapers, for

00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:52.021
example writing in to the police, so writing letters to the police, pretending to be Jack The

00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:52.351
Ripper.

00:05:54.131 --> 00:06:01.571
Indeed, the nickname Jack The Ripper was given to the killer because that's how a letter sent to the

00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:02.981
police was signed.

00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:11.531
Although now it's believed that this was actually a fake letter sent by a journalist to try to boost

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:14.861
interest in the case and sell more newspapers.

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:21.791
Despite all of the public awareness, the murders continued.

00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:25.041
And the police were unable to find the killer.

00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:29.901
More than 2000 people were interviewed.

00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:40.791
Over 300 people were investigated by the police, and 80 people were detained, they were put into

00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:41.181
jail.

00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:49.161
But to no avail, the killer was still at large, he still wandered the streets.

00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:55.011
And so the public decided to take things into their own hands.

00:06:55.821 --> 00:07:03.021
A group of volunteer citizens in London's East End patrolled the streets looking for suspicious

00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:07.551
characters because they were unhappy with the police's efforts.

00:07:08.811 --> 00:07:11.481
But still, there was no sign of him.

00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:20.378
And there were hundreds of theories about who he actually was, or even, was it one individual or a

00:07:20.378 --> 00:07:21.188
group of people?

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:29.861
Some said that the fact that the murders happened around weekends or public holidays and all within

00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:36.401
a very close vicinity of one another, they were very close to one another, meant that he must have

00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:38.441
been a man who lived locally.

00:07:40.156 --> 00:07:46.396
But others thought that The Ripper must be an educated, upper-class man.

00:07:46.996 --> 00:07:55.006
The use of his knife suggested that he had some anatomical knowledge, so did this suggest he might

00:07:55.006 --> 00:08:02.797
have been a doctor or even an aristocrat who came to the poor area of London with the specific

00:08:02.827 --> 00:08:05.137
objective of killing prostitutes?

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:13.979
Remember in 1888 it was a lot easier to get away with murder, to evade capture by the police.

00:08:14.609 --> 00:08:23.789
Obviously there was no CCTV, no DNA matching and that area of London in particular had pretty poor

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:24.749
street lighting.

00:08:26.219 --> 00:08:33.869
To be caught you would have to either be found at the scene or have left some identifying object at

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:37.769
the scene or be found covered in blood soon after.

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:44.730
And for this reason, a vast amount of crimes at this time went unsolved.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:52.680
And the role of the police was more from a preventative point of view than a crime solving one.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:02.330
And with The Ripper, the police were none the wiser, they didn't have any real information about who

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:06.500
he was or why he was committing these horrible crimes.

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:15.469
One of the theories about why Jack The Ripper chose prostitutes as his victims was actually because,

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:21.599
compared to other types of people, they were the easiest to kill and get away with.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:29.099
They worked at night, and by default they were already working on the edges of society.

00:09:30.816 --> 00:09:33.751
So who actually was Jack The Ripper?

00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:41.491
Well, there are over a hundred suspects, some of whom are taken more seriously than others.

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:49.091
But there's no conclusive evidence with which we can say with certainty that we know who he is.

00:09:51.075 --> 00:09:59.085
So let's just take a look at three of these suspects from very different backgrounds, which I think

00:09:59.085 --> 00:10:09.495
shows you just how little idea people really have of who Jack The Ripper was and how, even now, with

00:10:09.495 --> 00:10:18.465
the ability to match DNA, we aren't any clearer on the identity of this infamous serial killer.

00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:29.269
So our first suspect is Aaron Kosminski, a Jewish Polish immigrant who worked as a barber in

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:30.259
London's East End.

00:10:31.212 --> 00:10:39.312
Police records at the time give the surname Kosminski as a suspect, however, no first name was

00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:39.762
given.

00:10:41.682 --> 00:10:50.142
Over a hundred years after the crimes were committed, in 2014, scientists claimed that this man,

00:10:50.532 --> 00:10:59.388
Aaron Kosminski, they claimed that his DNA matched the DNA on a scarf from one of the victims, and

00:10:59.388 --> 00:11:02.388
therefore he must have been Jack The Ripper.

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:08.688
They'd finally discovered the true identity of Britain's most famous serial killer.

00:11:09.713 --> 00:11:16.493
But others dispute the methodology of this, and it's definitely not definitive evidence to point the

00:11:16.493 --> 00:11:17.903
finger at Kosminski.

00:11:19.203 --> 00:11:26.733
Secondly, and I should say that this is a claim that isn't taken very seriously, there is a theory

00:11:27.003 --> 00:11:36.303
that Lewis Carroll, the author of books such as Alice in Wonderland, was the true identity of Jack

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:36.873
The Ripper.

00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:47.133
The theory goes that Caroll was traumatized by experiences as a child at school, which left him with

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:49.053
a desire to kill women.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:58.258
The supposed evidence for this is that there are anagrams, where you rearrange the letters of a word

00:11:58.258 --> 00:12:06.628
or sentence, so there are anagrams in letters that he published in which he admitted to the crimes.

00:12:08.196 --> 00:12:17.341
What's more according to his main accuser Caroll wrote a diary every day in purple ink, but on the

00:12:17.341 --> 00:12:22.141
days of the Whitechapel killings, he switched to black.

00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:31.201
But I wouldn't worry too much, nobody really takes this claim particularly seriously, and I'm just

00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:37.081
mentioning it here to illustrate quite how bizarre some of the theories are.

00:12:38.409 --> 00:12:45.800
Our final suspect was an Irish-born American named Francis Tumblety.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:56.050
Not only was Tumblety a suspect in the Jack The Ripper case, but he was also a suspect, or rather a

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:00.760
suspect as an accomplice to the murder of Abraham Lincoln.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.680
He was obviously quite an eccentric individual and he claimed to have done things ranging from

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:16.800
knowing Charles Dickens and the German emperor King Wilhelm through to Napoleon The Third, the

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.910
emperor of France.

00:13:18.862 --> 00:13:26.392
He is suspected of being The Ripper because of his hatred of women and a particular hatred of

00:13:26.422 --> 00:13:30.472
prostitutes, after he had a failed marriage to a prostitute.

00:13:31.262 --> 00:13:39.741
He was arrested in November 1888 for something completely different, for homosexual activity, which

00:13:39.741 --> 00:13:42.441
was still illegal in England at that time.

00:13:44.463 --> 00:13:52.761
While he was awaiting trial, he posted bail, where you pay a sum of money to be allowed out of jail,

00:13:53.361 --> 00:14:01.491
but knowing that he was a suspect also in the Jack The Ripper case, he fled to France and then to

00:14:01.491 --> 00:14:02.301
the United States.

00:14:03.481 --> 00:14:10.711
Despite the British police's attempts to extradite him, and bring him back to Britain for

00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:16.651
questioning, the Americans wouldn't do it, saying that there wasn't enough evidence.

00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:19.727
So he was never brought back to be questioned.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:28.590
So that's just three of the hundred plus people who are suspected of being Jack The Ripper.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.070
I'll leave the link in the show notes and you can peruse the rest at your leisure if you, if you'd

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:35.340
like.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:43.650
One thing that I think everyone can agree on is that whoever Jack The Ripper really was, the secret

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.180
of his identity seems to be something he took to the grave with him.

00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:56.802
It's telling that in Madame Tussaud's Waxworks museum in London where there are representations of

00:14:56.802 --> 00:15:03.762
famous characters from history, Jack The Ripper is represented just as a shadow.

00:15:05.952 --> 00:15:14.022
Okay then I appreciate that the subject matter of today's podcast was a little dark, but I hope that

00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:16.992
you'll agree that the subject is pretty fascinating.

00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:24.792
Jack The Ripper has captured the attention of the British public for over 130 years now.

00:15:25.332 --> 00:15:31.872
And given that the mystery shows no signs of being solved, I think that it's going to continue to

00:15:31.872 --> 00:15:35.622
fascinate and disgust people for many years to come.

00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:41.953
As a reminder, if you haven't checked out the animating transcripts yet, then do head to

00:15:41.953 --> 00:15:44.143
Leonardoenglish.com and have a look.

00:15:44.533 --> 00:15:48.013
I like to think of them as subtitles, but way better.

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:51.943
So it's definitely worth a look if you haven't done so already.

00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:59.263
And as a final point, which came as a little bit of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise,

00:15:59.653 --> 00:16:06.643
the podcast was featured as the top English learning podcast on iVoox, the Spanish speaking world's

00:16:06.703 --> 00:16:12.163
favourite podcast app last week, so if you are someone who discovered the show through that,

00:16:12.373 --> 00:16:15.193
welcome, bienvenidos, it's great to have you.

00:16:16.663 --> 00:16:21.253
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:16:21.608 --> 00:16:25.678
I'm Alastair Budge and I'll catch you in the next episode.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:16.176
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:20.316
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:27.966
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Eli Cohen, the Israeli spy

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:33.666
who infiltrated the very highest levels of the Syrian military and government in what has

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:38.846
been called the most daring and effective intelligence-gathering operation in history.

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:46.156
It’s a tale of international espionage, of cunning, bravery, and of Middle Eastern rivalries.

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:51.946
It’s important, but it’s also an amazing story, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.136
OK then, Eli Cohen.

00:00:57.396 --> 00:01:04.606
On the 18th May, 1965, a crowd gathered in Marjeh Square in Damascus, Syria.

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:11.271
The outer edges were lined with trees and official looking buildings, and in

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:16.986
the middle was a green space from which a long column shot up into the sky.

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:23.536
It was like any other square you might find in the city, but on this day

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:27.826
there were armed men patrolling, and military trucks coming and going.

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:34.136
Whispers and hushed conversation echoed around, and pedestrians passing

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:39.256
by stopped, looked, and came closer to see what all the fuss was about.

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:46.066
They joined the crowd, jostling for position to get a good look at what’s going on.

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:50.116
Peering over into the middle of the square, they saw

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:54.696
a wooden construction, and a man… hanging there, dead.

00:01:56.026 --> 00:02:04.406
Over his body was a white sheet covered in Arabic script, and his head was slumped, the neck broken.

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:08.436
The man was “Kamel Amin Thaabet”.

00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:14.616
He was a rich, well-known and politically connected Syrian socialite and businessman.

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:20.056
Except his name wasn’t “Kamel Amin Thaabet”.

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:23.056
His name was Eli Cohen.

00:02:23.856 --> 00:02:26.646
He was neither a socialite nor a businessman.

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:28.366
He wasn’t even Syrian.

00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:33.486
He was a spy for the Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency.

00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:39.886
To find out how Cohen got to this point, we need to first go back in time to

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:44.836
understand more about his life and what was going on in the Middle East at this point.

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:51.536
Eli Cohen was born on in 1924, in Alexandria, in Egypt, to

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:56.116
Syrian-Jewish parents from Aleppo who were committed Zionists.

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:02.936
Cohen’s background–as an Egyptian born, son of Jews from Syria who would

00:03:02.936 --> 00:03:08.236
later go on to work for Mossad–captures perfectly the complicated and

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:12.856
interconnected nature of Middle Eastern politics in the post-war years.

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:19.736
As a very brief reminder of some of the main events here, at midnight on May

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:25.856
the 14th, 1948, British control of the state of Palestine was due to expire.

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:30.776
And it was unclear what would happen to the tiny territory

00:03:30.936 --> 00:03:34.646
that had been plagued by civil war between Jews and Arabs.

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:39.736
The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine had proposed two

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:44.926
states - one Jewish, one Arab - and the state of Israel was created.

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:49.986
Within hours of Israel’s creation, however, it was at war.

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:55.896
On May 15th, just hours after Israel’s Declaration of Independence, the

00:03:56.066 --> 00:04:00.926
armies of the surrounding countries of Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan

00:04:01.156 --> 00:04:05.496
invaded the territories that had, until the day before, been British.

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:11.656
The invasion began the Arab-Israeli War and set in motion decades of

00:04:11.656 --> 00:04:17.666
political and military instability in the region, but by late 1948 Israel

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:22.316
controlled territory beyond the borders originally outlined in the U.N plan.

00:04:23.576 --> 00:04:27.956
Over half a million Palestinian refugees fled to neighbouring countries,

00:04:28.216 --> 00:04:33.276
and Jews, facing increasing pressure and intimidation in places

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:37.846
like Egypt and Syria, were expelled or tried to escape to Israel.

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:43.376
By 1949 Israel found itself newly established, with

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:47.126
expanded borders, but surrounded by hostile neighbours.

00:04:48.406 --> 00:04:53.166
That was the political storm Eli Cohen would put himself right in the middle

00:04:53.176 --> 00:04:58.886
of: Egypt, Israel, and Syria will be the three key countries in Cohen’s story.

00:04:59.476 --> 00:05:02.516
Oh, and Argentina too, but more on that later.

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:07.776
The year after the creation of the state of Israel, Cohen’s parents and

00:05:07.936 --> 00:05:13.926
three brothers moved from Egypt to Israel, but the young Eli Cohen stayed

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:18.526
in Egypt to finish his engineering degree at Cairo Farouk University.

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:26.636
While in Egypt he became involved in Jewish and Zionist activities, helping other Jewish

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:32.656
families escape to Israel and he became well-known to the Egyptian intelligence services.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:40.086
He was implicated in several spy operations in Egypt, but while other members of the

00:05:40.246 --> 00:05:45.606
Jewish-Egyptian spy ring were executed by the Egyptian authorities, Cohen managed

00:05:45.636 --> 00:05:50.856
to get off the hook, the Egyptian authorities were never able to find definitive

00:05:50.886 --> 00:05:56.116
proof that Cohen was involved in anything more serious than pro-Zionist campaigning.

00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:03.006
Anyway, unafraid of what had happened to some of his fellow Zionists in Egypt, in the

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:10.256
summer of 1955 the 30-year-old Cohen went to Israel for a specialist spy training course.

00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:17.576
He returned briefly to Alexandria but in 1956, when Israel occupied the Sinai

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:23.806
Peninsula as tensions flared during the Suez Crisis, Cohen was again detained by

00:06:23.806 --> 00:06:29.146
the Egyptians and eventually expelled along with most of the Jewish community.

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:37.006
He travelled to Israel via Naples, and upon his arrival assumed that his pro-Israeli activity

00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:43.706
in Egypt, combined with his spy course experience and fluency in Arabic, French and English,

00:06:43.746 --> 00:06:49.126
would make him a perfect candidate for a job with the Israeli intelligence agency, the Mossad.

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:52.576
He would be wrong, at least this time.

00:06:53.716 --> 00:06:58.856
After offering his services to the Mossad twice, he was rejected and placed

00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:04.326
on a reserve list as a translator and logistics clerk in the Israeli Air

00:07:04.326 --> 00:07:10.426
Force - an office job, essentially, and not exactly what Eli Cohen had in mind.

00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:16.386
Some people have suggested that Cohen was initially rejected from the Mossad

00:07:16.526 --> 00:07:20.936
because of an old psychological evaluation they had done some years before.

00:07:22.646 --> 00:07:30.256
Cohen, the Mossad had said, had ‘a high IQ, great bravery, a phenomenal memory,

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:37.666
and the ability to keep a secret’, but also that he ‘did not always evaluate

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:43.286
danger correctly and was liable to assume risks beyond those which are necessary.’

00:07:45.346 --> 00:07:48.216
Remember this, as it will be important later on.

00:07:49.376 --> 00:07:54.486
Anyway, frustrated at his inability to join the Israeli intelligence,

00:07:54.666 --> 00:07:58.566
Cohen worked as an accountant in Tel Aviv for a couple of years.

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:04.406
In 1959, he married an Iraqi-Jewish immigrant called Nadia,

00:08:04.706 --> 00:08:07.946
and the couple settled into the coastal city of Bat Yam.

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:13.336
But Cohen was generally fed-up with civilian life, he

00:08:13.336 --> 00:08:17.406
was bored of his office job, and he yearned for action.

00:08:18.926 --> 00:08:22.216
His chance would come when tensions flared at the

00:08:22.216 --> 00:08:25.266
border with Syria, the homeland of Cohen’s parents.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:30.726
The Mossad, the Israeli Secret Service, decided to take another look at him.

00:08:32.146 --> 00:08:37.166
The then Director-General of the Mossad, a man named Meir Amit, was

00:08:37.176 --> 00:08:42.686
looking for a special agent to infiltrate the Syrian government, and came

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:46.796
across Cohen’s name while looking through a list of rejected candidates.

00:08:48.076 --> 00:08:53.736
Cohen’s language skills were appealing, and the fact he was born in an Arab

00:08:53.756 --> 00:09:00.176
country and said to have Arab features, to be able to pass as an Arab, also helped.

00:09:01.596 --> 00:09:07.046
After being followed for a couple of weeks, Cohen was judged to be a suitable candidate

00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:12.716
for training and he completed a proper six-month spy course at the Mossad training school.

00:09:13.456 --> 00:09:18.716
He learned how to handle weapons and he developed all types of other important spy

00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:25.916
skills: map reading, morse code, high-speed driving, cryptography, and radio transmitting.

00:09:26.846 --> 00:09:31.686
All important skills, but the last one, radio transmitting, would be

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:36.496
something that would later prove pivotal, very important, in his downfall.

00:09:37.886 --> 00:09:42.366
In order to make his cover even more convincing, Cohen was taught

00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:47.936
the principles of Islam, how to pray and, most importantly, trained

00:09:47.956 --> 00:09:52.326
to speak with a Syrian accent and not his native Egyptian tongue.

00:09:53.656 --> 00:09:58.996
And of course, he was given a false identity as a wealthy Syrian businessman.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:07.426
Cohen’s new name - his new identity - was Kamel Amin Thaabet, a rich Syrian expatriate.

00:10:08.236 --> 00:10:12.566
An expatriate, or expat, as they’re often referred to, simply

00:10:12.566 --> 00:10:15.446
means someone who lives outside of their native country.

00:10:16.726 --> 00:10:23.356
To make his cover, his new identity, even more believable, in early 1961 the Mossad

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:29.446
sent Cohen to establish himself as an expat Syrian businessman in Buenos Aires,

00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:34.826
in Argentina, where at the time there was a sizable and rich Syrian community.

00:10:36.356 --> 00:10:42.446
Under his new name, Cohen quickly indulged himself in Buenos Aires’ nightlife and made

00:10:42.446 --> 00:10:47.396
contacts in the Syrian community, including officials working at the Syrian Embassy.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:53.016
This group of diplomatic staff allegedly included the Syrian military attaché

00:10:53.016 --> 00:10:58.626
at the time, Amin al-Hafez, who would later go on to be both Prime Minister and

00:10:58.666 --> 00:11:03.656
President of Syria, although al-Hafez denied that he ever met Cohen in Argentina.

00:11:04.986 --> 00:11:10.186
What Cohen went on to do would be hugely embarrassing for the entire Syrian

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:15.536
political, military and intelligence establishments, not only for al-Hafez.

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:22.936
Anyway, Cohen made it obvious that he - or rather, Kamel Amin Thaabet - was very wealthy,

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:29.316
and he threw luxurious parties for the wealthy Syrian expat community in Buenos Aires.

00:11:30.316 --> 00:11:35.546
He also engaged in political discussion and gossip, and claimed publically to have

00:11:35.546 --> 00:11:41.816
sympathies towards the Syrian Ba'ath Party, and lots of money to donate towards it.

00:11:42.846 --> 00:11:49.836
The Ba'ath Party would go on to seize power in Syria in 1963, and the connections Cohen made with

00:11:49.836 --> 00:11:55.836
it during his time in Argentina would further cement his cover story when he arrived in Damascus.

00:11:57.206 --> 00:12:04.066
When he arrived - or as he said ‘returned’ - to Syria in 1962, he rented an apartment in the

00:12:04.066 --> 00:12:09.896
fashionable Damascus district of Abu Romana in a building opposite Syrian military headquarters.

00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:16.596
He settled into life in Syria, quickly restarting his social life and using

00:12:16.596 --> 00:12:20.606
the contacts he had made in Argentina to meet some of the most powerful

00:12:20.786 --> 00:12:24.816
and influential people in Syria’s political and military establishment.

00:12:26.076 --> 00:12:31.216
Many of his friends from Buenos Aires offered to help him set up businesses, or

00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:35.986
to introduce him to famous Syrians and important figures from the government.

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:42.416
He continued his extravagant social life, and used his contacts to throw

00:12:42.686 --> 00:12:47.086
boozy parties for high-ranking Syrian politicians and military officials.

00:12:47.886 --> 00:12:51.676
He plied them with alcohol and carefully probed for

00:12:51.686 --> 00:12:55.486
information, even lending money and advice to some of them.

00:12:56.616 --> 00:13:04.766
His cover, and backstory in Argentina, had worked perfectly, and Cohen, or Kamel Amin Thaabet,

00:13:04.906 --> 00:13:11.636
as he was known to them, had firmly established himself as a member of the Syrian social elite.

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:14.886
And he used it to great effect.

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:19.986
Believing that Cohen was a wealthy businessman with Ba’athist sympathies,

00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:25.126
Syrian officials talked openly with him about military plans and equipment,

00:13:25.316 --> 00:13:30.146
often with a drink in hand and women paid by Cohen stroking their hair.

00:13:31.246 --> 00:13:35.146
The information the Syrians revealed so casually, and quickly, to

00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:40.096
Cohen, was shocking not only to the spy but even to the Mossad.

00:13:41.316 --> 00:13:47.136
Soon after his arrival in Damascus, he had already sent information to the Mossad about

00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:52.906
bunkers where the Syrians stored Russian artillery, leaked a planned invasion of northern

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:59.816
Israel, and informed the Mossad about two hundred tanks just hours after they landed in Syria.

00:14:01.096 --> 00:14:04.966
Cohen warned the Israelis that the Syrians were planning to reroute

00:14:05.126 --> 00:14:09.816
the Jordan River to starve Israel of water, and even gave them enough

00:14:09.856 --> 00:14:14.126
information to destroy the equipment the Syrians were going to use to do it.

00:14:15.566 --> 00:14:19.356
And when he wasn't hosting parties for top military officials

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:22.466
in his apartment, he was watching them from across the road.

00:14:23.706 --> 00:14:28.486
The strategic location of his apartment allowed Cohen to report on what

00:14:28.486 --> 00:14:31.806
was happening at the military headquarters at all hours of the day.

00:14:32.506 --> 00:14:37.426
He reported on how many people were there at night, what time the lights went out, who

00:14:37.426 --> 00:14:44.176
came and went, when motorcades came and left, and his vantage point, his position right

00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:48.636
in front of the headquarters, gave him a good idea of when something was about to happen.

00:14:49.696 --> 00:14:55.816
When nothing was happening, he simply invited them over for parties and measured the mood of

00:14:55.976 --> 00:14:59.223
Syria’s political and military elite from their party chatter, from the conversation at the party.

00:14:59.223 --> 00:15:08.356
Encouraging his guests to drink, Cohen remained sober, but pretended to be drunk,

00:15:08.896 --> 00:15:14.296
took note of what they said and sent the important information back to his Israeli

00:15:14.306 --> 00:15:19.766
handlers via radio transmitter, coded letter, occasionally in person, whenever he

00:15:19.826 --> 00:15:25.136
returned to Israel, and even via letters with invisible ink that went through Europe.

00:15:26.236 --> 00:15:32.016
When the Ba'ath Party seized power in 1963 - led by Cohen’s old friend from

00:15:32.016 --> 00:15:38.086
Argentina, Amin al-Hafez - Cohen’s old friends became Syria’s ruling class.

00:15:39.296 --> 00:15:44.926
He was by then so established and trusted in Syrian high society that al-Hafez is

00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:50.496
even rumoured to have considered appointing him Syrian Deputy Minister of Defence.

00:15:51.616 --> 00:15:53.436
Cohen was in.

00:15:53.976 --> 00:15:55.976
And the Syrians had no idea.

00:15:56.896 --> 00:16:00.746
He was even allowed to read classified defence documents, advise

00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:05.506
government ministers, and was taken on tours of Syrian military bases

00:16:05.546 --> 00:16:09.896
and fortifications, all while sending the information back to Israel.

00:16:11.076 --> 00:16:16.576
Cohen’s cover story had worked beyond even the wildest dreams of the Mossad.

00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:22.426
Perhaps his most incredible piece of intelligence work, however, was when he

00:16:22.486 --> 00:16:27.246
collected information on the Syrian military defences at Golan Heights - a

00:16:27.426 --> 00:16:32.626
strategically important area on the Syrian-Israeli border and valuable water

00:16:32.636 --> 00:16:37.216
resource that had long been a point of conflict between Israel and Syria.

00:16:38.506 --> 00:16:44.406
Since Israel’s creation, Syrian forces had used the high, elevated position

00:16:44.426 --> 00:16:48.746
of Golan Heights to launch attacks on Israel’s northern region of Galilee.

00:16:50.046 --> 00:16:56.016
Incredibly, it is alleged that when Cohen was taken on a tour of the Golan Heights by Syrian

00:16:56.076 --> 00:17:02.296
military officials, he said he was sorry, he expressed sympathy for the Syrian soldiers

00:17:02.456 --> 00:17:08.546
standing in the sun all day and suggested that trees be planted to create areas of shade.

00:17:10.016 --> 00:17:15.546
A kind and generous idea, perhaps, some shade for the soldiers standing in the hot sun.

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:19.796
But Cohen’s primary concern wasn’t the soldiers.

00:17:20.046 --> 00:17:25.386
He thought these trees might serve as excellent markers for the Israeli army one day.

00:17:26.396 --> 00:17:31.706
And indeed, the Israel Defence Forces, or IDF, were then said to have

00:17:31.716 --> 00:17:37.716
used the trees as targets during the Six-Day War, in 1967, when Israel

00:17:37.716 --> 00:17:42.296
captured Golan Heights in two days, and long after Cohen was dead.

00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:48.496
But despite all of Cohen’s abilities as a spy, it would be precisely

00:17:48.496 --> 00:17:52.546
his confidence and recklessness that would prove his downfall.

00:17:53.896 --> 00:17:58.596
If you remember from earlier, his Mossad evaluation was that he was considered

00:17:58.596 --> 00:18:03.346
reckless and ‘liable to assume risks beyond those which are necessary’.

00:18:04.766 --> 00:18:09.906
Well, it turns out that this assessment was spot on, the Mossad was right.

00:18:10.776 --> 00:18:14.906
In the autumn of 1964, Cohen made a trip back to Israel.

00:18:15.676 --> 00:18:20.186
It was a long stay - one that would prove to be his last - and his

00:18:20.206 --> 00:18:24.136
wife Nadia later said that he was worried about returning to Damascus.

00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:29.726
Feeling the pressure of his operation, Cohen feared the Syrians were actively

00:18:29.726 --> 00:18:34.616
searching for the ‘mole’ - a term for someone who passes on sensitive information.

00:18:35.446 --> 00:18:41.126
Yet, he still agreed to go back to Syria, and promised his wife that this would be his last trip.

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:47.806
I should say that there’s some disagreement between the Mossad and the Cohen family

00:18:47.906 --> 00:18:52.376
about how exactly that happened, and whether or not Cohen actually wanted to go.

00:18:53.396 --> 00:18:58.436
Nadia, his wife, said that Cohen only returned to Syria after he was

00:18:58.656 --> 00:19:03.166
pressured by the Mossad; the Mossad said that they warned him to be especially

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:08.116
careful and, specifically, not to send too many radio transmissions.

00:19:09.546 --> 00:19:14.606
And it’s related to the last point that things start to go wrong for Eli Cohen.

00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:18.946
Under pressure from the Mossad or not, Cohen went back

00:19:18.966 --> 00:19:22.086
to Syria and continued to send radio transmissions.

00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:24.326
And he was doing it a lot.

00:19:24.726 --> 00:19:25.736
Too much, in fact.

00:19:26.863 --> 00:19:30.853
Cohen’s fears that the Syrians knew about the mole were right.

00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:36.643
Syria’s intelligence chief, Colonel Ahmad Suweidani, had made it his

00:19:36.653 --> 00:19:41.143
mission to find the mole and stop the leak of sensitive information that

00:19:41.143 --> 00:19:45.263
was damaging the Syrian war effort and embarrassing its military leaders.

00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:52.983
He got help from the Soviets, and on January 24, 1965, the Syrians organised a period

00:19:52.993 --> 00:19:58.793
of radio silence and used Soviet tracking equipment to detect radio transmissions.

00:19:59.603 --> 00:20:03.783
Essentially, they stopped all radio transmissions, thinking that if

00:20:03.783 --> 00:20:07.713
they could find someone who was sending a transmission, this would

00:20:07.713 --> 00:20:12.333
probably be the mole, the person who was sharing military secrets.

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:19.463
They picked up a transmission, triangulated the transmitter, and Syria’s secret police got

00:20:19.463 --> 00:20:24.153
ready to burst into the apartment where it seemed like the transmission was coming from.

00:20:25.173 --> 00:20:30.096
The apartment, of course, belonged to Kamel Amin Thaabet, or Eli Cohen.

00:20:31.136 --> 00:20:37.516
Syrian security officers kicked down, and found Cohen in the middle of sending a transmission.

00:20:38.306 --> 00:20:42.876
He was, as we say in English, ‘caught red handed’, caught in the act.

00:20:43.916 --> 00:20:49.656
Cohen tried to deny that he was a spy, but it quickly became clear that nothing could save him.

00:20:50.726 --> 00:20:56.426
When he was captured, the Syrian intelligence service forced Cohen to send fake transmissions

00:20:56.686 --> 00:21:03.226
to the Mossad, hoping they could recover the situation and use Cohen as a tool against Israel.

00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:08.266
Cohen, however, was not the kind of person to turn on his country.

00:21:08.886 --> 00:21:13.286
The secret code he used in his communications with the Mossad told

00:21:13.286 --> 00:21:17.296
them that these were not normal transmissions and not to be trusted.

00:21:18.226 --> 00:21:24.496
The Mossad knew something was wrong, and tried to figure out ways to get Cohen out of Syria.

00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:28.026
Israel appealed to the Pope and the U.N.

00:21:28.556 --> 00:21:35.776
A plan was made to kidnap famous or important Syrians as bargaining chips for negotiation.

00:21:36.886 --> 00:21:41.046
Paying a ransom to the a Syrians via the French was suggested,

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:45.546
and also that special Israeli forces be sent in to free him.

00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:52.116
Israel was even prepared to give the Syrians what intelligence they had on Syrian domestic

00:21:52.116 --> 00:21:58.266
politics, such as anti-Ba'athist plots to overthrow the government, in exchange for their top spy.

00:21:59.366 --> 00:22:03.286
But none of it mattered - the Syrians would not negotiate.

00:22:04.546 --> 00:22:09.396
After being tortured and interrogated over many weeks, Cohen was put on

00:22:09.396 --> 00:22:16.026
trial in February of 1965, found guilty of espionage, and sentenced to death.

00:22:17.266 --> 00:22:21.596
On the 15 of May, Cohen wrote his last letter to his wife.

00:22:22.766 --> 00:22:27.416
In it, he said, “I am begging you my dear Nadia not to

00:22:27.416 --> 00:22:30.296
spend your time in weeping about something already passed.

00:22:30.806 --> 00:22:35.036
Concentrate on yourself, looking forward for a better future!”

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:43.476
Three days later, on Tuesday the 18th of May, 1965, Eli Cohen was hanged in Marjah Square.

00:22:44.706 --> 00:22:47.766
He had been permitted to see a Rabbi in his last

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:51.576
moments, but in death no such honour was bestowed on him.

00:22:52.526 --> 00:22:57.066
His body was covered in a white sheet outlining his crimes, left

00:22:57.066 --> 00:23:01.266
hanging for hours as a spectacle for the crowd gathered in the square.

00:23:02.536 --> 00:23:07.436
After his execution, Syria refused to return Cohen’s body to Israel.

00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:12.656
They ignored requests from his wife and his family for the body, and

00:23:12.826 --> 00:23:16.756
the mystery about Cohen’s final resting place remains to this day.

00:23:17.956 --> 00:23:24.586
In 2008 the Syrian government said that Cohen had been buried three times so that nobody would

00:23:24.656 --> 00:23:30.156
ever find the body, and to prevent the remains from being returned to Israel by the Mossad.

00:23:31.546 --> 00:23:35.676
The only piece of Eli Cohen that remains is his watch, which was

00:23:36.236 --> 00:23:41.476
reported in 2018 to have been found and returned to Israel, where it

00:23:41.476 --> 00:23:45.916
was presented to his family in a ceremony by the director of the Mossad.

00:23:46.896 --> 00:23:53.376
In terms of his legacy, Eli Cohen is remembered as Israel’s most famous and successful spy.

00:23:54.556 --> 00:23:59.456
The information Cohen provided saved Israeli lives, weakened the Syrian war

00:23:59.456 --> 00:24:04.756
effort and allegedly even played a role in Israel’s victory in the Six Day War.

00:24:05.916 --> 00:24:11.726
Cohen’s was not only an extraordinary story, and piece of espionage, but an incredible

00:24:11.736 --> 00:24:17.786
character transformation: from an Egyptian born Jew of humble beginnings into a wealthy

00:24:17.826 --> 00:24:23.696
Arab businessman who wined and dined Syrian high-society, all while working against them.

00:24:24.876 --> 00:24:29.926
In terms of his legacy, he has been remembered in biographies, films, a

00:24:30.026 --> 00:24:34.336
recent Netflix series called “The Spy”, as well as countless documentaries.

00:24:35.156 --> 00:24:40.466
In Israel, streets and neighbourhoods are named after him, but perhaps the highest

00:24:40.476 --> 00:24:45.856
honour was reserved for a piece of land in the Golan Heights, the area Israel was able to

00:24:45.866 --> 00:24:51.956
capture in 1967 helped by Cohen’s information and his persuading the Syrian authorities

00:24:51.956 --> 00:24:57.336
to plant trees above the military bases to protect the soldiers from the hot sun.

00:24:58.616 --> 00:25:03.216
This piece of land used to be called “El Al”, but it ’s now

00:25:03.216 --> 00:25:07.936
called Eliad, after the most famous spy in Israel, Eli Cohen.

00:25:09.836 --> 00:25:15.786
OK then, that’s it for today’s episode on Eli Cohen, the Israeli spy

00:25:15.996 --> 00:25:19.896
who infiltrated the upper-echelons of Syria's military establishment

00:25:20.056 --> 00:25:23.886
and just perhaps altered the course of Middle Eastern history.

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:29.126
I hope it was an interesting one, and whether you knew a lot about Cohen before, or

00:25:29.306 --> 00:25:32.816
this was the first time you’d heard of him, well, I hope you learned something new.

00:25:33.786 --> 00:25:36.806
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:25:37.186 --> 00:25:39.186
Had you heard of Eli Cohen before?

00:25:39.746 --> 00:25:43.826
If you were alive, what do you remember of his capture and execution?

00:25:44.206 --> 00:25:46.606
Do you know of any other famous spies like Cohen?

00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:50.186
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

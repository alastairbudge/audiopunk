Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.969
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.850
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.160
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the race to the north pole.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.320
It's a story of one of exploration’s great rivalries,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.690
of two former colleagues who turned into fierce enemies.

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:41.006
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into the story of the race to the North Pole.

00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:50.246
In August of 1909, a ship left Greenland, with Copenhagen its final destination.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:55.186
The journey across the north Atlantic would take several weeks.

00:00:55.706 --> 00:01:01.536
It would be cold, fierce winds blowing, and large waves crashing over the boat.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:07.656
Luckily, the passengers of this ship had something to keep them entertained.

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:13.966
One of the passengers was a man named Dr Fredrick Cook.

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:19.056
He was a doctor by training, but had become an explorer.

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:22.586
And he had quite the story to tell.

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:32.636
A year earlier, on April 21st, 1908, Cook had become the first person to reach the North Pole.

00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:38.476
He regaled his fellow passengers with stories of adventures in the freezing ice,

00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:45.586
narrow escapes from polar bears, almost falling down icy crevasses, being cut off

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:52.416
from civilisation, lost on the sea ice and being forced to survive on seal meat.

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:59.006
He had successfully managed what no human being had managed before, he had made

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:04.816
it literally to the top of the world, and he had survived to tell the tale.

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:12.616
And on September 1st, 1909, the ship Cook was on, made a stop in the

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:17.036
town of Lerwick, in the Shetland Isles, right to the north of Scotland.

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:23.063
The ship’s captain suggested to Cook that he get the word out quickly.

00:02:23.903 --> 00:02:26.543
After all, history had been made.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:30.473
Cook wasted no time in doing so.

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:36.923
He sent a telegram to The New York Herald, which you might remember as being the newspaper

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:41.673
that financed the search for the famous Dr Livingstone, from an episode a few weeks back.

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:49.373
The next day, The New York Herald printed the headline “The North Pole Is Discovered by Dr.

00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:50.323
Frederick A.

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:50.773
Cook”.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.330
But just a week later, readers of another newspaper, The New York Times, would wake

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.120
up to the headline: “Peary Discovers the North Pole After Eight Trials in 23 Years.”

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.656
Peary wasn’t just some nickname for Fredrick Cook, Peary, Robert

00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:15.796
Peary to give him his full name, was a completely different person.

00:03:16.856 --> 00:03:23.626
He was another Arctic explorer, and had been in fact Fredrick Cook’s colleague and mentor.

00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:29.836
He returned from what he said was the first expedition to successfully

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:34.976
reach the North Pole, only to find that his great rival had got there first.

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:37.586
Or had he?

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:42.976
Cook, according to Peary, never reached the North Pole.

00:03:43.576 --> 00:03:46.786
He was a liar, a charlatan and a fraud.

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:53.036
Instead, Peary should get all the credit for being the first person to reach the North Pole.

00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:55.876
So, who was right?

00:03:56.646 --> 00:04:04.526
Which of these two men actually won the race to the North Pole, Cook, Peary, or neither of them?

00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:10.576
To start this story, we should probably have a mini geographical refresher.

00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:15.166
The North Pole is, of course, the most northerly point in the world.

00:04:16.036 --> 00:04:20.376
And there was a certain mystery about what existed at The North Pole.

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:23.426
Was it a frozen land mass?

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:26.006
A frozen sea covered in ice?

00:04:26.606 --> 00:04:28.746
An incredibly rough, open sea?

00:04:29.426 --> 00:04:33.296
Or a mysterious new and undiscovered continent?

00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:40.046
And in the frenzy of 19th century and early 20th century exploration

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:45.296
mania, ships and explorers set out to finally discover the truth.

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:52.416
The first major expedition came in 1827, and was led

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:55.706
by a British Admiral called William Edward Parry.

00:04:56.806 --> 00:05:01.386
Parry would get to 82 degrees north, which is pretty good

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:06.146
going, but remember that the North Pole is 90 degrees north.

00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:08.306
He still had a way to go.

00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:15.846
And after Parry, almost 100 others would try, but they would all come up short.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:22.726
You probably need no reminder that getting to the North Pole is no mean feat.

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:29.396
A ship needs to navigate its way through the ice, there is a high chance you will get stuck,

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:34.976
and if your ship does manage to make it through the ice, when you have to disembark and go

00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:40.746
across the ice on foot, you’ll need to watch out for polar bears, crevasses, and snowstorms.

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:46.366
You’ll need to survive on tinned meat and biscuits, you’ll need to make sure you don’t

00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:52.306
run out of supplies, and you’ll have to do all of this in blisteringly cold temperatures.

00:05:53.816 --> 00:05:58.116
Some people, who obviously didn’t subscribe to the view that “it’s not about

00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:03.096
the destination, it’s about the journey”, some people tried to take a shortcut.

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:08.306
In the case of some Swedish explorers, they tried to fly over the

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:12.966
North Pole in a hydrogen balloon, but they vanished into thin air,

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:18.976
only to be found 33 years later, very cold and, of course, very dead.

00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:25.236
After going on 100 failed attempts, towards the end of the 19th

00:06:25.246 --> 00:06:28.996
century, the expeditions were getting a little more serious.

00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:35.626
And one man who was certainly a serious explorer was Robert Peary.

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:41.746
He was an experienced sailor, and an Admiral in the US navy.

00:06:42.806 --> 00:06:48.376
In 1886 he took a break from the navy, with the goal of crossing Greenland.

00:06:49.646 --> 00:06:55.536
He successfully did this, and became the first person to discover that Greenland was in

00:06:55.536 --> 00:07:01.456
fact a separate landmass; it didn’t go all the way to the North Pole as people had thought.

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:08.276
On this voyage he also made another important discovery, and a discovery that

00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:13.116
made him realise that perhaps he wasn’t discovering all that much at all.

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:20.106
He met and befriended some native Inuit people, people who lived in the Arctic Circle.

00:07:21.136 --> 00:07:25.776
It became clear to Peary that the Inuits had an incredibly sophisticated

00:07:25.796 --> 00:07:29.736
understanding of how to survive in these Arctic conditions.

00:07:30.486 --> 00:07:36.336
They knew how to hunt, what to eat, how to build an igloo, how to dress appropriately,

00:07:36.726 --> 00:07:42.256
how to work with dogs to pull a sleigh, and how to cross the icy terrain.

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:48.376
Peary realised that there was a huge amount of knowledge that they had developed over

00:07:48.376 --> 00:07:52.626
the course of hundreds of years, knowledge that would be incredibly valuable to him.

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:59.116
Unlike most other explorers that had come before him, Peary chose to

00:07:59.126 --> 00:08:04.696
enlist the help of indigenous Inuit people, but he also knew that he needed

00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:09.006
modern medicine and trained doctors to help him if anything went wrong.

00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:17.486
And he found a doctor in the form of a 26-year-old recent medical graduate called Fredrick Cook.

00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:24.526
Cook was initially drawn to the world of adventure as a way of escaping from the real world.

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:32.976
A year before, in 1890, his wife and baby both died during childbirth, and

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:37.046
the young man was looking for anything to take his mind off the trauma.

00:08:38.446 --> 00:08:43.746
He joined Peary’s 1891 expedition as a volunteer, and he would

00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:48.186
later write "It was as if a door to a prison cell had been opened".

00:08:49.396 --> 00:08:53.696
It was lucky he was there, as his medical services were soon called upon

00:08:53.976 --> 00:08:58.786
after the expedition leader, Peary, broke his leg in a shipyard accident.

00:08:59.856 --> 00:09:03.676
The young doctor set two broken bones, and Peary

00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:06.576
was able to be on his way once the bones had healed.

00:09:07.986 --> 00:09:14.296
Peary was, understandably, grateful for the young doctor’s services, but after the

00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:19.526
expedition returned to the United States, there were signs of a split between the pair.

00:09:20.836 --> 00:09:27.156
Cook wanted to publish the results of a study he had completed, but Peary said no.

00:09:28.006 --> 00:09:33.646
Peary was the leader of the expedition, and his account needed to be published first.

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:39.076
In other words, Peary was the boss, Cook was merely the doctor.

00:09:40.096 --> 00:09:44.266
Cook wasn’t best pleased about this, and when the opportunity to go

00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:48.796
on another expedition with Peary came up a year later, he refused.

00:09:50.036 --> 00:09:54.776
Peary was without his preferred doctor, but this wasn’t going to stop him.

00:09:55.626 --> 00:09:58.751
He now had his sights firmly set on the North Pole,

00:09:59.081 --> 00:10:02.051
and there was nothing that was going to get in his way.

00:10:02.921 --> 00:10:09.631
He made multiple trips during the 1890s, each time failing to reach his intended destination.

00:10:10.751 --> 00:10:14.101
He knew that if he became the first person to set

00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:18.011
foot on the North Pole, fame and glory awaited him.

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:25.541
This isn’t an exaggeration; he literally admitted as much in a letter to his mother in 1897.

00:10:26.951 --> 00:10:31.741
And I'm quoting directly: "My last trip brought my name before the world; my

00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:36.631
next will give me a standing in the world....I will be foremost in the highest

00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:41.291
circles in the capital, and make powerful friends with whom I can shape my future

00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:47.541
instead of letting it come as it will....Remember, mother, I must have fame."

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:48.881
End quote.

00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:55.751
Cook, on the other hand, seemed to have got a taste for the explorer’s life.

00:10:56.661 --> 00:11:01.561
He went on an expedition to the Antarctic in 1897, where he

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:05.121
worked closely with the Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen.

00:11:06.441 --> 00:11:12.021
And a few years later, in 1903, he led the first expedition to reach the

00:11:12.051 --> 00:11:16.491
top of Denali, or Mt McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America,

00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:21.091
successfully summitting it and taking a picture of himself at the top.

00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:25.742
Well, remember this as we’ll return to this point in a little bit.

00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:31.889
Anyway, the point is that Cook was fast becoming a household name, and in

00:11:31.889 --> 00:11:36.719
1907, a year after returning from the top of the highest mountain in North

00:11:36.719 --> 00:11:42.669
America, he set off to plant his flag on the top of the world, the North Pole.

00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:49.439
Cook’s party arrived in Greenland, and then set off north in February of 1908.

00:11:50.419 --> 00:11:55.179
The expedition party was initially made up of Cook, nine indigenous

00:11:55.219 --> 00:12:00.539
Inuit people, and 11 sledges that would be pulled by 103 dogs.

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:06.009
The journey was, as you might imagine, incredibly tough.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:12.179
They had to fight their way through snowstorms and severe winds and mountains of ice.

00:12:13.229 --> 00:12:18.489
As they neared what Cook believed to be the North Pole, most of the party

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:24.819
turned back, and Cook was left with two Inuit guides, Etukishook and Ahwelah.

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:32.356
They managed to cross almost 600 kilometres in 24 days, so 25

00:12:32.356 --> 00:12:36.439
kilometres per day, through the most hellish of conditions.

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:41.796
Eventually, so Cook would recall, on April 21st,

00:12:41.979 --> 00:12:47.179
1908, they arrived at a tall flat-topped ice island.

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:54.119
Cook took out his sextant, took several measurements, and concluded that they were at,

00:12:54.479 --> 00:12:59.639
and I'm quoting directly, "a spot which was as near as possible" to the North Pole.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.249
They had finally arrived!

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:07.009
The group stayed there for two days, taking more measurements to

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:11.369
confirm that they were indeed at the top of the world, then Cook wrote

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:16.729
a note, put it in a small brass tube, and pushed it into the ice.

00:13:18.079 --> 00:13:23.659
The hard work was done, now it was the “easy bit”, getting home and telling the world.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:29.629
Apart from as soon as Cook and his two companions started the return

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:33.889
journey, it was clear that they had made an important miscalculation.

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:39.959
The ice flowed in a different direction to what they had assumed, so

00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:44.499
that they found themselves in a completely different position, separated

00:13:44.659 --> 00:13:48.279
from the supplies that they had left behind on their return journey.

00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:54.329
This had taken several months, which meant that winter would soon be approaching.

00:13:55.689 --> 00:14:00.239
To make matters worse, they had run out of ammunition, bullets, both

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:04.029
to defend themselves from polar bears and as a means of hunting.

00:14:05.349 --> 00:14:12.749
They had to hibernate, essentially, in a small igloo for four months, and hunt seals with spears.

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:17.559
Luckily Cook had the two Inuit guides with him,

00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:21.129
otherwise one imagines he might not have fared so well.

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:27.259
The group survived the winter, and the men eventually made their way back to Greenland,

00:14:27.549 --> 00:14:33.579
where they arrived in April 1909, fourteen months after setting off on their expedition.

00:14:34.599 --> 00:14:39.279
And of course, they had no radio or means of communication with the outside world.

00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:44.759
Nobody had seen or heard from them since they had set off a year before.

00:14:46.289 --> 00:14:53.249
Now, as you heard at the start of the episode, Cook got on a ship to Denmark, and sent that famous

00:14:53.259 --> 00:14:58.989
telegram announcing his achievement, that he had become the first person to reach the North Pole.

00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:07.249
But while this was all happening, his ex boss, essentially, Robert Peary, was also en route to

00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:13.579
the pole, desperate to try to finally plant his flag and claim this achievement for himself.

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:19.529
And Peary’s group was significantly larger and better equipped than Cook’s.

00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:24.739
This would be Peary’s eighth attempt, and failure was not an option.

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:33.379
The group included 50 men, almost 50 sledges and a whopping 246 dogs.

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.392
They were most certainly prepared.

00:15:36.849 --> 00:15:42.899
Peary knew the direction he needed to go in, and when the group was around 200 kilometres

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:48.839
away from the pole, he sent the rest of the group back, going ahead with four Inuit

00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:54.489
guides and another fellow American, an African-American man named Matthew Henson.

00:15:55.959 --> 00:16:01.429
On April 6th, 1909, Henson told Peary that he had a feeling

00:16:01.469 --> 00:16:04.529
that they were there, they had reached the North Pole.

00:16:06.049 --> 00:16:12.529
So the story goes, Henson turned to Peary and said, "we are now at the Pole, are we not?".

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:18.979
To which Peary replied, "I do not suppose that we can swear we are exactly at the Pole".

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:25.629
It was the end of a long day, so the men set up camp, deciding that they

00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:29.039
would go about the business of taking measurements the following morning.

00:16:30.429 --> 00:16:36.279
Then they turned in for the evening, but not before Peary in true patriot

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:41.119
style took out an American flag and put it on a pole outside their igloo.

00:16:42.669 --> 00:16:47.249
The following morning the group rose, took some measurements to confirm that,

00:16:47.289 --> 00:16:52.219
yes, they were indeed at the North Pole, and then they headed back south.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:58.009
Of course, if they were truly at the North Pole, the only direction they could have gone was south.

00:16:59.529 --> 00:17:04.859
Clearly, the journey south was no stroll in the park, but they made it back.

00:17:06.399 --> 00:17:09.939
When Peary arrived in Greenland, he discovered that

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:13.239
Cook had recently returned from a trip to “the North”.

00:17:14.629 --> 00:17:19.879
He interrogated some Inuits who had heard about Cook’s trip, and it emerged

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:24.679
that Cook had claimed that he had reached the North Pole a year before Peary.

00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:30.709
And if you thought that Peary might have thought, “ok, that’s a shame,

00:17:30.709 --> 00:17:35.939
but I guess Cook got there first”, well, things didn’t quite go like that.

00:17:37.329 --> 00:17:42.939
Peary did everything he could to publicly discredit Cook and cast doubt

00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:46.839
on whether his former colleague had ever actually got to the North Pole.

00:17:48.249 --> 00:17:51.549
It turned out that there was quite a lot to question.

00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:56.789
The first thing to mention is that it was very difficult for anyone at

00:17:56.789 --> 00:18:01.619
this point to be able to say for sure that they had reached The North Pole.

00:18:03.139 --> 00:18:07.979
There was no sign, of course, and the location of the Pole was constantly changing.

00:18:08.709 --> 00:18:12.779
Or rather, the Pole was static but the ice above it was moving.

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:19.239
And if you are wondering how both Cook and Peary figured out that they were at The North

00:18:19.239 --> 00:18:25.939
Pole, what measurements they actually took, they used something called a sextant, which is

00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:31.629
the measuring device that looks a little bit like a combination of a telescope and a ruler.

00:18:33.259 --> 00:18:39.979
The problem is that sextants don’t work particularly well at the poles, especially the North

00:18:39.979 --> 00:18:46.369
Pole, given the consistently moving nature of the ice, so they simply weren't very accurate.

00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:52.419
The second point that Peary questioned was the duration of Cook’s trip.

00:18:53.639 --> 00:19:01.499
If you recall, Cook claimed that he went 600 kilometres in 24 days, so 25 kilometres a day.

00:19:02.579 --> 00:19:07.549
That’s quite good going even if you’re walking in normal conditions, along a road, let’s

00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:14.579
say, but this expedition involved dragging supplies over snow and ice, avoiding crevasses,

00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:20.079
under incredibly difficult conditions, literally travelling to the top of the world.

00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:22.339
It was amazingly fast.

00:19:23.019 --> 00:19:26.069
Too fast for it to be credible, Peary said.

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:32.099
Well, the truth would come out in Cook’s journals and records, in which he would have

00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:37.869
recorded exactly where they had gone every day, and this could be checked and verified.

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:43.809
But it would later transpire that these records were nowhere to be found.

00:19:44.929 --> 00:19:48.209
Cook had left them with a man he had befriended in Greenland,

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:52.559
with orders for them to be sent to America on the first ship.

00:19:53.579 --> 00:20:00.489
But the first ship back was the SS Roosevelt, a ship built specifically for Peary’s expedition.

00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:06.079
When Cook’s new friend asked Peary to take Cook’s belongings back with him,

00:20:06.639 --> 00:20:12.389
Peary refused, and the belongings were never seen or heard of ever again.

00:20:13.879 --> 00:20:18.259
With no way of proving what he had done, increasing scrutiny

00:20:18.369 --> 00:20:22.159
was placed on Cook’s claims, which he had no way of proving.

00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:29.559
And even his previous claims of exploration and derring do were more closely examined.

00:20:31.069 --> 00:20:36.159
Unfortunately for Cook, it turned out that he had a weakness for exaggeration.

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:39.139
In other words, he was a liar.

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:43.629
When his famous conquest of the tallest peak in North America was

00:20:43.629 --> 00:20:47.929
examined, it was revealed that he never actually got to the top.

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:53.309
The picture that he took and publicised of himself “at the top”

00:20:53.349 --> 00:20:57.809
of Denali, or Mount McKinley, this turned out to be a fake.

00:20:58.449 --> 00:21:05.419
It was taken from an angle that made it look like he was at the top, but he was most certainly not.

00:21:06.909 --> 00:21:10.859
What’s more, the indigenous people that Cook claimed were

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:13.189
with him when he reached the North Pole were questioned.

00:21:14.299 --> 00:21:19.389
Under pressure, they admitted that they hadn’t gone nearly as far north as Cook had said they had.

00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:23.269
They didn’t know exactly where they had got to, but

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:26.009
it certainly didn’t seem like it was the North Pole.

00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:32.109
Cook’s claims were rubbished, and he was cast as a fraud.

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:37.219
Although to his dying day I should say that he would maintain that he was

00:21:37.219 --> 00:21:41.399
not, and that he was truthfully the first person to reach The North Pole.

00:21:42.589 --> 00:21:44.580
So, how about Peary?

00:21:45.379 --> 00:21:50.029
Well, there are plenty of people who have claimed that he also might never have made

00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:55.139
it to the North Pole, or at least, even if he did, it might well have been his fellow

00:21:55.139 --> 00:22:01.349
explorer, Matthew Henson, an African-American, who set foot on the pole before Peary did.

00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:09.859
But if neither Cook nor Peary nor Henson did, who was the first person to reach the North Pole?

00:22:11.339 --> 00:22:15.439
The first person to reach The North Pole for sure was the Norwegian

00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:21.379
explorer Roald Amundsen in 1926, although he cheated somewhat by going by

00:22:21.419 --> 00:22:26.239
airship, so he didn’t actually set foot on the pole, he only flew over it.

00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:33.069
This happened in 1926, and Amundsen made sure to take all of the proper documentation

00:22:33.399 --> 00:22:37.909
to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that he had indeed reached the top of the world.

00:22:39.339 --> 00:22:43.019
So, as to the question of “the race to the north pole”,

00:22:43.459 --> 00:22:46.859
let me leave you with this perhaps philosophical question.

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:55.459
If the participants didn’t know that there was a race, if there was no winner, and if in fact none

00:22:55.499 --> 00:23:01.659
of the participants ever actually reached the finish line, was there ever really a race after all?

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:08.349
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Race to The North Pole.

00:23:08.759 --> 00:23:12.049
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:17.779
And if you like stories about races to a pole, I have some good news for you, as we are

00:23:17.779 --> 00:23:22.319
going to be following up this episode with another one about the race to the South Pole.

00:23:22.919 --> 00:23:27.109
It does involve Roald Amundsen, snow, ice and freezing temperatures,

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:31.679
but it is a very different story and it’s wonderful in its own way.

00:23:31.979 --> 00:23:33.219
So I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:38.859

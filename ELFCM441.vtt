Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.609
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:19.459
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.309
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man called Bryan Johnson.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.249
For the rock and roll fans out there, sorry, I don’t mean the lead singer of

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.009
AC/DC, nor do I mean the controversial raw meat-eating influencer, Liver King.

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.959
I am talking about Bryan Johnson, the former technology executive who decided a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:46.949
couple of years ago that he was going to make it his life’s mission to live forever.

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.119
So, in the spirit of us mere mortals all having limited time, let’s

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:57.139
get right into it and learn about the unusual plans of Bryan Johnson.

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.509
Those of you with an encyclopaedic knowledge of The Bible might

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.896
remember what is written in the Book of Psalms, Psalm 90:10.

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.199
It goes like this: "The days of our years are threescore years and

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:20.479
ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.909
strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away."

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.569
“Score” means twenty in this case, so threescore and

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.349
ten means three times twenty, and then 10, so 70.

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.799
In other words, this psalm says “Humans live for 70 years, sometimes

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.589
80 if they are strong and healthy, but life ends, we all die”.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.269
Now, this was of course written thousands of years ago, when someone would have been

00:01:55.269 --> 00:02:00.799
pretty lucky to live to their 70th birthday, and even luckier to see their 80th.

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:05.159
Fortunately for most people around the world today,

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.459
we are living for longer, 70 is now 80, 80 is now 90.

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:13.949
But progress has slowed.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:21.849
In Europe, for example, the life expectancy at birth went from a measly 42.7

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:30.799
years in 1900 to 70 in 1967, but thereafter it has only increased very gradually,

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:36.429
and in fact has decreased in the past few years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:45.419
The point is, most people are living longer than ever before, but there is some kind of biological

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:52.859
cap on life, the older we get, the more starts to go wrong, and if you are lucky enough to be

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:59.399
within touching distance of your 100th birthday, statistically speaking you are in a minority and

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:05.969
you will be incredibly lucky to see your 110th birthday, becoming a so-called “supercentenarian”.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:15.039
Life has a hard stop, so it seems, and try as we might, there is little we can do to fight this.

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.259
There is, however, one man who does not believe this, a man who has made

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:28.139
it his life’s mission to fight off ageing, and ultimately defeat death.

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.399
His name is Bryan Johnson.

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:38.159
You might remember him from an episode we made a few weeks back on Transhumanism, but I

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:43.689
decided that his story deserves much more than a fleeting glance, to be mentioned in passing.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:51.739
His background before embarking on his mission of living forever was as a technology entrepreneur.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.109
He founded a company called Braintree, which processed payments for

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:02.092
online businesses, and was then sold to PayPal for $800 million.

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.938
Now, this technology background is important for three reasons.

00:04:09.037 --> 00:04:15.441
Firstly, the most obvious reason is that he sold his company for 800 million dollars, and he

00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:21.477
is thought to have personally walked away with something like 300 million dollars, meaning he

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:27.487
never had to work again, and had hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on this expensive goal.

00:04:28.757 --> 00:04:31.327
The second reason is related to the first.

00:04:31.907 --> 00:04:37.297
After becoming extremely rich, he followed the well-trodden path of the rich man throughout

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:44.887
history - he realised that he could buy anything: houses, treasures, boats, even fame and power.

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:48.927
He could wave his credit card and all problems would go away,

00:04:49.527 --> 00:04:54.317
everything had a price, all issues could be solved, for a fee of course.

00:04:55.147 --> 00:05:01.187
But, like many rich and powerful people throughout history, there was one thing he discovered

00:05:01.207 --> 00:05:06.997
he could not buy his way out of, one thing that no amount of money could solve: death.

00:05:08.547 --> 00:05:13.147
And the final, perhaps most important reason, has to

00:05:13.147 --> 00:05:16.937
do with his outlook on life and how the world works.

00:05:18.516 --> 00:05:23.337
If you are a software engineer, or you have a technical background, you will know

00:05:23.367 --> 00:05:28.987
that the world of computer code and programming is, on one level, blissfully simple.

00:05:29.547 --> 00:05:34.617
You write code, you give a computer instructions, and it executes them.

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:40.447
Of course, knowing how to do this effectively requires a large amount of skill

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:46.267
and experience but the point is that computers don't make mistakes; humans do.

00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:51.127
And the way Bryan Johnson views the world is more

00:05:51.127 --> 00:05:53.777
like how a software engineer approaches their work.

00:05:54.397 --> 00:05:56.607
There are inputs and outputs.

00:05:57.097 --> 00:06:03.847
The biological word, the world of atoms, is no different from the world of bits, of computer code.

00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:08.247
If a seed receives the right amount of water and is

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:11.437
put in the right soil, it will grow into a small plant.

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:16.747
If it receives more water and the right amount of sunlight, it will grow into a tree.

00:06:17.867 --> 00:06:19.697
Inputs and outputs.

00:06:20.937 --> 00:06:25.357
And of course, you need instructions to achieve the desired output.

00:06:26.947 --> 00:06:30.677
To Bryan Johnson, the human body is no different.

00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:34.127
We all sort of know this already.

00:06:34.507 --> 00:06:39.987
We know that eating processed food, drinking alcohol, not exercising, not getting natural

00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:46.957
light, smoking, and a plethora of other “unhealthy things”, we know that these are “bad for us”.

00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:52.637
And on the flip side, we know that it’s a good thing to eat fruit and vegetables,

00:06:52.807 --> 00:06:57.427
to drink lots of water, to exercise, to have natural light, and so on.

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:01.677
But we tend to know this on a general level.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:06.487
Bryan Johnson wanted to know the exact instructions.

00:07:07.247 --> 00:07:10.627
How much protein does he need to eat on a daily basis?

00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:11.967
How much water?

00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:13.287
How much sleep?

00:07:13.717 --> 00:07:15.647
What is the perfect amount of exercise?

00:07:17.007 --> 00:07:22.697
He wanted a blueprint for exactly what a human needs to do to keep their

00:07:22.717 --> 00:07:28.487
body in the optimum state, he wanted an instruction manual for eternal life.

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:34.997
Of course, the world is full of fitness and lifestyle coaches, telling you how to

00:07:35.027 --> 00:07:41.517
exercise in a particular way or follow a certain diet, but these tend to be general.

00:07:42.107 --> 00:07:47.107
Bryan Johnson wanted exact instructions, he wanted the perfect recipe.

00:07:48.477 --> 00:07:52.737
There was none, so he decided to try to create it for himself.

00:07:54.277 --> 00:08:00.717
It's hard to pinpoint exactly when this interest and project started, but as early as 2019

00:08:01.117 --> 00:08:06.227
he publicly declared that he was making some unconventional moves to optimise his sleep.

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:14.757
On the second of February, 2019, he announced via Twitter, and I’m quoting directly: “For sleep

00:08:14.787 --> 00:08:21.884
optimization, I’ve been eating dinner at 4pm, not drinking alcohol, and going to bed at 9pm.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.247
Who knew that being the most boring person ever could feel SO GOOD”.

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:33.795
A year later he then “fired Evening Bryan”, not allowing himself

00:08:33.795 --> 00:08:36.865
to make any decisions in the evening about what he consumed.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:41.175
He thought about his own decision-making and saw that

00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:44.885
in the evening he made poor decisions about what to eat.

00:08:46.145 --> 00:08:49.735
Instead, of thinking, “ok, I should make better decisions in the evening”,

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:55.005
he simply said, “Evening Bryan is not allowed to make any decisions”.

00:08:56.625 --> 00:09:03.685
Fast forward a few years, and this lifestyle hobby has transformed into something even more extreme.

00:09:05.115 --> 00:09:10.115
Now it isn’t just “Evening Bryan” that is not allowed to make any decisions about Bryan

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:15.885
Johnson’s food consumption; no Bryans can decide what Bryan Johnson eats or drinks.

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:23.265
Everything he puts in his body is prescribed by an algorithm, based on the measurements of his body.

00:09:24.705 --> 00:09:29.735
Much like a patient in a hospital might be hooked up to all sorts of machines that

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:33.705
measure their blood pressure and heart rate, so that a doctor can decide if they

00:09:33.705 --> 00:09:39.125
need more or less of a drug, Bryan Johnson’s body is constantly being measured

00:09:39.435 --> 00:09:43.995
so that an algorithm can prescribe him exactly the right type of nutrition: how

00:09:43.995 --> 00:09:48.905
many grammes of protein, how much fat, how much salt, how much water, and so on.

00:09:50.325 --> 00:09:57.485
He publicly announced this in October of 2021, and according to Johnson at least, it is working.

00:09:58.935 --> 00:10:02.755
Now, how do you define “working”, you might be thinking.

00:10:03.475 --> 00:10:06.675
Well, one data point that is given from these frequent

00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:10.605
measurements is the “biological age” of key organs.

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:16.785
Last year, when he was 46 years old, he reported that he had

00:10:16.895 --> 00:10:21.665
the bones of a 30-year-old and the heart of a 37-year-old.

00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:26.365
In other words, his body was a lot younger than it would

00:10:26.365 --> 00:10:29.885
have been had he been following a “normal” lifestyle.

00:10:31.435 --> 00:10:36.085
And this brings us to the question of immortality, of cheating death.

00:10:37.315 --> 00:10:41.355
Let’s remember Johnson’s almost algorithmic perspective on the world.

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:46.585
There are instructions, inputs, and outputs, if something happens,

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:50.425
then something else happens, it’s programming, but for the body.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:58.205
For most people, their biological age increases at the same or similar rate as their real age.

00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:04.505
I am 36 years old, I guess I have the heart and bones of a 36-year-old man.

00:11:05.115 --> 00:11:10.115
Next year I’ll be one year older, and my heart and my bones will also be one year older.

00:11:10.635 --> 00:11:12.135
That’s just how life works.

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:21.115
But Bryan Johnson’s goal is for the biological age of his organs to increase at a slower rate than

00:11:21.115 --> 00:11:29.735
his real age, so instead of adding a biological year every 365 days, he adds less than a year.

00:11:31.295 --> 00:11:37.085
To be precise, his stated goal for 2024 is to lower his speed of

00:11:37.095 --> 00:11:45.265
ageing to 0.69, so he adds 0.69 biological years for every real year.

00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:50.332
But 0.69 years is still more than 0.

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:55.965
Doing this slows the ageing process, but it doesn’t stop it altogether.

00:11:57.205 --> 00:12:03.115
His idea, his mission, is to slow down the ageing process to a sufficient

00:12:03.135 --> 00:12:07.455
degree that he’s able to live long enough for more breakthroughs to be made.

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:14.199
And as you’ve seen, he is patient zero, publicly documenting everything

00:12:14.379 --> 00:12:17.841
from his annual intake of vegetables to the number of pills he has taken,

00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:22.591
from the number of hours of nighttime erections to the hours of exercise.

00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:29.031
His goal is to create this global movement of people who do exactly what he is doing.

00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:36.491
The ironic thing, or perhaps the sad thing, is that a lot of what he is doing

00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:41.960
is just plain common sense backed by decades of scientific and medical research.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:48.870
Sure, some elements of his routine have raised concerns from medical professionals, especially

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:54.030
the more intrusive elements and the sheer number of pills he is taking at the same time.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.680
But a lot of it is stuff that you and I know already.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.310
We know that it’s important to get a good night’s sleep, to

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.370
eat healthily, to limit alcohol, and to exercise frequently.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:11.910
On one level, what Bryan Johnson is proposing isn’t that complicated,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:16.180
most people just aren’t prepared to sacrifice “living life” to do it.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.420
To give you a simple and perhaps obvious example, over the Christmas

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.890
break he posted a picture of himself at an American bowling alley.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.790
On the left-hand side of the picture was a menu with an image of fried chicken

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:38.740
and cheesy tacos, on the right-hand side was Bryan Johnson with his own high

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.350
protein and low fat nut-based pudding that he had brought along instead.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:50.500
We all know that eating the high protein nut-based food would be a healthier option than

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.860
eating the fried chicken and cheesy tacos, and we all know that eating healthier foods is a

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:01.260
good thing for us and will probably mean that if we do it every day we will live for longer.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.160
But do we bring along nut-based pudding to a social event?

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.820
No, we order the fried chicken and cheesy tacos.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.620
The interesting thing that Bryan Johnson is trying to do is to get us to think

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:20.890
about our relationship with food, drink, and our lifestyles in a very different way.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.460
Instead of doing what we want to do, what we think will make us feel

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.860
good in that moment, we should outsource that decision to someone else.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:37.120
Bryan Johnson is outsourcing that decision to an algorithm that tells him what

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.110
to eat and drink, based on the measurements of what is happening in his body.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.725
This is an expensive procedure, costing Johnson a reported 2 million dollars a year.

00:14:48.865 --> 00:14:54.905
But what he is trying to do is to create this blueprint, this system, for what

00:14:54.925 --> 00:14:59.995
people should do, so that, as a follower of Johnson’s Blueprint, you get your

00:14:59.995 --> 00:15:04.885
instructions and your inputs from his system rather than choosing them yourself.

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:12.175
His publicly stated goal is to create this open source, free, system for how

00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:15.805
anyone can live their lives to ensure that they can live as long as possible.

00:15:16.965 --> 00:15:24.895
Now, this brings us to the million-dollar question, if you knew that you could add another 20, 30,

00:15:25.335 --> 00:15:32.505
50, or 100 years to your life by following a very strict not just diet but an entire way of living,

00:15:32.925 --> 00:15:38.415
from going to bed at 9 pm to giving up all of your favourite food and drink, would you do it?

00:15:39.775 --> 00:15:43.035
To bring it back to the example of the picture from the bowling alley,

00:15:43.465 --> 00:15:47.715
would you forgo the cheesy nachos and fried chicken and instead bring along

00:15:47.715 --> 00:15:51.605
a nutty pudding if you knew that this would mean you would live to 150?

00:15:52.245 --> 00:15:56.555
Not just at the bowling alley, but would you apply this logic to everything in your life?

00:15:58.055 --> 00:16:01.785
Bryan Johnson certainly thinks that there are enough people in the world who would

00:16:01.785 --> 00:16:06.935
answer “yes” to this question, and he's been very busy for the past year or so

00:16:07.235 --> 00:16:11.705
shouting from the rooftops, doing interviews with hundreds of magazines and TV shows,

00:16:11.935 --> 00:16:16.345
to try to reach as many people as possible who might be sympathetic to this goal.

00:16:17.353 --> 00:16:19.332
And it seems to be working.

00:16:19.962 --> 00:16:23.682
No matter whether you agree with him or not, his message has been

00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:28.192
highly effective, his face splashed all over newspapers and magazines.

00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.082
Will he live forever?

00:16:31.002 --> 00:16:34.352
Who knows, but you certainly can’t deny that he’s trying.

00:16:36.882 --> 00:16:42.252
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Bryan Johnson, The Man Who Wants To Live Forever.

00:16:42.832 --> 00:16:46.552
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that this

00:16:46.552 --> 00:16:50.762
was an interesting deeper dive into someone that we touched on a few episodes ago.

00:16:51.572 --> 00:16:54.242
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:16:54.502 --> 00:16:57.882
If you could live to 150 but you couldn’t decide what to

00:16:57.882 --> 00:17:00.402
eat or drink for the rest of your life, would you do it?

00:17:01.022 --> 00:17:05.112
If you have made a drastic lifestyle change in your life, what was

00:17:05.112 --> 00:17:09.512
it, why did you make it, and how has it changed your outlook on life?

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:13.122
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:17:13.602 --> 00:17:16.802

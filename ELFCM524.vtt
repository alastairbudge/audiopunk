Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.490
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.890
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.828
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our mini-series on the loose theme of mystery.

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:34.538
In part one, we talked about the strange world of secret societies, both past and present,

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:40.168
and learned about Yale’s Skull & Bones society, the Knights Templar and the FreeMasons.

00:00:40.798 --> 00:00:44.308
In part three, the next episode, we are going to talk about some

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:49.008
civilisations lost to time, or at least, perhaps lost to time.

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:55.428
And in today’s episode we are going to talk about spycraft, the art of espionage.

00:00:56.428 --> 00:01:01.428
In this, we will take a sweeping look at the history of espionage and its major

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:06.778
developments, and keep listening to the end as I will also tell you a personal

00:01:06.788 --> 00:01:12.688
story about someone I know quite well who may or may not have been a spy…

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:17.688
So, let’s not waste a minute and get right into it.

00:01:19.568 --> 00:01:25.305
To the outside world, Anna Chapman was a successful internet entrepreneur.

00:01:26.055 --> 00:01:34.065
She arrived in New York in 2006 at the age of 24 with little more than a dream, and a few years

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:40.475
later, she was running an apparently successful online estate agency, employing 50 people.

00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:48.775
But in the summer of 2010, she got an unexpected knock on her door.

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:50.885
It was the FBI.

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:58.415
She was arrested for being part of a Russian spy ring, sent by Moscow to the

00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:05.695
United States to live and exist, on the face of it, regular, mundane, normal lives.

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:13.025
Chapman, or Kushchenko, as she was before she married and took her husband’s name, was

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:19.365
one of the so-called Illegals Program, a group of at least 10 Russian sleeper agents.

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:27.785
They were sleeper agents in that, on the face of it, they lived very ordinary, unremarkable lives.

00:02:28.035 --> 00:02:32.835
They bought houses, they sent their kids to American schools, their neighbours

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:36.685
remarked on how much effort they put into pruning their flower beds.

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:42.875
They were not doing James Bond-style jumping out of aeroplanes or even hiding

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:48.275
in forests with their telescopes; their instructions were to melt into American

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:53.675
society so that they would appear just like any, good, law-abiding citizen.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:03:00.355
Their ultimate goal was to get information that might be useful to the Russian

00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:06.425
state, information about US foreign policy, US policy towards Russia, military

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:12.335
secrets and so on, and the idea was that they would make friends and business

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:16.799
contacts with people who could provide them with information that might be useful.

00:03:18.168 --> 00:03:21.118
Unfortunately, they didn’t do a particularly good job.

00:03:22.228 --> 00:03:26.478
Some of the spies in the group had been active for almost a decade,

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:30.758
but they hadn’t managed to collect any particularly useful information.

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:36.348
We know this because for several years they were being watched by the

00:03:36.378 --> 00:03:42.258
FBI; the undercover Russian mission had been uncovered, and was being

00:03:42.268 --> 00:03:47.518
tracked by a secret American operation named Operation Ghost Stories.

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:54.358
In this mission, the FBI successfully intercepted messages, bugged telephone

00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:59.548
lines, and cracked secret codes, thereby minimising the chance that these

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:03.748
spies would be able to find and send anything useful back to Moscow.

00:04:05.088 --> 00:04:09.638
The spies were arrested, and ultimately deported to Russia in a

00:04:09.668 --> 00:04:13.578
prisoner swap for Russian prisoners who had been spying for the West.

00:04:14.798 --> 00:04:19.048
This is just one recent example of what is sometimes

00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:23.128
called the world’s second-oldest profession: spying.

00:04:23.848 --> 00:04:30.768
Now, the rationale for spies to exist, and for countries to use them, barely needs elaboration.

00:04:31.548 --> 00:04:36.618
Knowing what other people are doing or thinking, knowing what your enemy might be planning

00:04:36.728 --> 00:04:43.098
or what military capabilities they have, this is and always has been extremely valuable.

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:50.098
Sun Tzu, the famous Chinese military theorist and author of The Art of War,

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:55.828
dedicated an entire chapter to the use of spies, even listing the different

00:04:55.838 --> 00:05:00.978
types of spies and explaining how to turn an enemy spy into a double agent.

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:07.328
It’s thought that he lived and wrote this sometime between 500 BC

00:05:07.368 --> 00:05:13.168
and 200 BC, but he was not the first nor the last to dedicate himself

00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:17.608
to thinking deeply about the role and effective management of spies.

00:05:18.528 --> 00:05:20.903
By the way, if you’d like to learn more about Sun

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:24.458
Tzu and The Art of War, we made an episode about him.

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:28.648
It’s episode number 128 if you haven’t listened to that already.

00:05:29.602 --> 00:05:31.302
But back to spying.

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:36.652
There is evidence of spies being used by everyone from the Ancient Egyptians

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:40.782
to the Aztecs, the Ancient Greeks to the Mongols under Genghis Khan.

00:05:42.222 --> 00:05:49.132
But it wasn’t until the 16th century or so that spying, or espionage,

00:05:49.372 --> 00:05:53.842
became a specialised and highly skilled profession in its own right.

00:05:54.752 --> 00:05:58.902
A man called Sir Francis Walsingham was perhaps the first real

00:05:58.912 --> 00:06:03.712
spymaster, the first leader of something akin to an intelligence agency.

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:11.172
He was a key advisor to Queen Elizabeth I of England, and as a very brief recap

00:06:11.362 --> 00:06:15.452
of what was going on while she was on the throne, it was a time of heightened

00:06:15.462 --> 00:06:20.142
religious tensions between Protestants, like Elizabeth, and Catholics,

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:25.042
like her relative and rival for the English throne, Mary Queen of Scots.

00:06:25.802 --> 00:06:33.822
By the way, we also have episodes on Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots, episodes 339 and 187.

00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:37.762
I’ll put a link to them below, in case you haven’t listened to those ones yet.

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:42.382
Anyway, it was a time of religious tensions and plots,

00:06:42.592 --> 00:06:46.602
and therefore, information was of the utmost importance.

00:06:47.724 --> 00:06:53.742
Walsingham managed to bring together a crack crew of spies, people skilled

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:57.692
at opening letters without breaking seals, as well as codebreakers.

00:06:58.462 --> 00:07:03.632
If you imagine a James Bond movie in which Bond inspects the latest gadgets

00:07:03.732 --> 00:07:09.772
and spying devices, well, Walsingham created the 16th-century version of that.

00:07:11.312 --> 00:07:16.082
In one particularly successful mission, Walsingham and his agents had

00:07:16.082 --> 00:07:20.502
the task of intercepting the communications between Mary Queen of Scots,

00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:25.202
who was imprisoned in a castle, and her supporters on the outside.

00:07:26.172 --> 00:07:31.212
Now, Mary knew that her letters would be read by her captors if they were sent

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:37.462
openly, but her supporters managed to arrange a special way to get a message to

00:07:37.462 --> 00:07:44.622
her—by smuggling them into a castle hidden in a waterproof box inside a beer barrel.

00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:50.022
Mary, perfectly reasonably, thought this seemed like a

00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:54.282
cunning plan, but she still didn’t want to take any chances.

00:07:55.062 --> 00:08:02.472
All letters to and from her were encrypted, so not only were they hidden and smuggled

00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:09.032
in secretly, but anyone who did manage to intercept one would think that it was a random

00:08:09.082 --> 00:08:13.692
collection of numbers and letters; they wouldn’t be able to understand what was written.

00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:21.261
She and her collaborators on the outside thought that her secret plan was working magnificently.

00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:27.911
Unfortunately, the entire beer barrel idea was masterminded by Sir

00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:32.641
Francis Walsingham, whose double agents and code-cracking specialists

00:08:32.671 --> 00:08:36.861
were intercepting and deciphering each and every one of those letters.

00:08:38.196 --> 00:08:42.226
And unlike the Russian spy ring you heard about a few minutes ago,

00:08:42.732 --> 00:08:46.556
Walsingham’s spies did manage to find some useful information.

00:08:47.306 --> 00:08:54.296
They discovered a plot against Elizabeth I, and Mary was swiftly arrested, put on trial for

00:08:54.296 --> 00:09:01.326
treason and executed, in a decisive example of how spycraft can change the course of history.

00:09:02.766 --> 00:09:08.556
And moving forward a few hundred years, as technology continued to develop and

00:09:08.586 --> 00:09:12.866
information could be passed through telegraph cables rather than through hushed

00:09:12.876 --> 00:09:19.916
whispers or hidden in beer barrels, the role and importance of espionage only increased.

00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:26.857
The ability to intercept, decode, and analyse messages became a powerful

00:09:26.897 --> 00:09:32.280
tool for nations, and espionage grew into a vast and complex operation

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.820
that would shape the outcome of wars and the direction of world politics.

00:09:37.825 --> 00:09:39.925
Take the First World War, for example.

00:09:40.675 --> 00:09:44.615
Spies weren’t just gathering information—they were intercepting

00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:49.595
it, decoding it, and then using it to gain strategic advantages.

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:55.129
To give you just one example of this, one of the most significant

00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:59.379
moments in the war was the interception of the Zimmermann Telegram.

00:10:00.587 --> 00:10:06.967
This was a secret communication from Germany to Mexico, proposing a military alliance

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:12.157
against the United States, and suggesting that Mexico could invade the United

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:18.317
States and recover their “lost territories” of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico.

00:10:19.607 --> 00:10:23.842
British intelligence intercepted the message, decoded it, and

00:10:23.892 --> 00:10:28.682
passed it along to the Americans, who were understandably outraged.

00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:33.827
Of course, the objective of the British intelligence services wasn’t

00:10:33.827 --> 00:10:38.407
just an “FYI to a friend”, it wasn’t done out of the goodness of their

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:44.277
heart; the purpose was to sway public opinion in favour of the U.S.

00:10:44.287 --> 00:10:45.127
joining the war.

00:10:46.507 --> 00:10:51.887
And, it worked, or at least a couple of months after it was made public, the

00:10:51.887 --> 00:10:56.177
United States declared war on Germany and sent troops to mainland Europe.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:02.592
Then, World War II took espionage to an entirely new level.

00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:08.812
It wasn’t just a weapon in the shadows—it became a key part of the Allied strategy.

00:11:09.932 --> 00:11:14.742
The British, for example, excelled at deception and codebreaking.

00:11:15.812 --> 00:11:21.472
At Bletchley Park, Alan Turing and his team worked tirelessly to crack

00:11:21.492 --> 00:11:26.202
the German Enigma Code, a feat that allowed the Allies to anticipate enemy

00:11:26.202 --> 00:11:30.942
movements and win critical battles, including the Battle of the Atlantic.

00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:36.242
Now, this work at Bletchley Park is credited with shortening the war

00:11:36.482 --> 00:11:41.562
by at least two years, thereby saving millions of lives on both sides.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:47.932
But espionage during WWII wasn’t just about sitting in rooms filled

00:11:47.932 --> 00:11:52.072
with machines and deciphering codes—it was also about action.

00:11:53.232 --> 00:12:00.622
In 1940 the UK formed something called the Special Operations Executive, which was an organisation

00:12:00.872 --> 00:12:07.175
created to send undercover intelligence officers into areas of mainland Europe under Nazi control.

00:12:08.105 --> 00:12:15.575
These agents numbered as many as 13,000, of whom a quarter were women, and their

00:12:15.595 --> 00:12:21.314
objective was to support local resistance movements and undermine Nazi control.

00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:29.208
Or, as Churchill reportedly briefed the leader of the operation, “Go and set Europe ablaze."

00:12:30.238 --> 00:12:33.618
One particularly inspiring character from this period was

00:12:33.618 --> 00:12:38.258
a woman called Nancy Wake, codename “The White Mouse”.

00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:43.666
She was parachuted into Nazi-occupied France in 1944.

00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:50.200
She led daring missions, coordinated with guerrilla fighters, once cycled 500

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.028
kilometres to pass a message back to her superior, and even killed a Nazi soldier

00:12:56.198 --> 00:13:01.718
with her bare hands, earning her a place as one of the war’s most remarkable spies.

00:13:03.088 --> 00:13:07.488
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the Office of Strategic

00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:14.428
Services, or OSS, was laying the groundwork for what would become the CIA.

00:13:15.423 --> 00:13:20.909
American agents were testing everything from psychological warfare to creative gadgets

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:26.909
like exploding pens and hollowed-out coins, all in a bid to outsmart their enemies.

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:32.419
In the Pacific, intelligence from spies and codebreakers helped turn

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:36.602
the tide against Japan, particularly in the pivotal Battle of Midway.

00:13:37.893 --> 00:13:43.303
By the time World War II ended, the value of espionage was undeniable.

00:13:44.763 --> 00:13:50.163
And in the Cold War, spies became the front-line soldiers in an ideological

00:13:50.173 --> 00:13:54.454
battle between the United States and the Soviet Union, a battle fought,

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:59.114
for the most part, not with guns and tanks but with information.

00:14:00.044 --> 00:14:04.704
Both sides recruited double agents, placed operatives in embassies,

00:14:05.014 --> 00:14:09.464
and used defectors to gain insights into their rival’s plans.

00:14:10.444 --> 00:14:14.937
The Berlin Wall, for example, became a hotbed of espionage.

00:14:15.643 --> 00:14:20.113
East German and Soviet agents worked to prevent defections, while

00:14:20.243 --> 00:14:23.993
Western agents smuggled people and information across the border.

00:14:25.313 --> 00:14:30.203
But the Cold War also gave rise to new types of spies—ones who

00:14:30.223 --> 00:14:34.653
operated not in enemy territories, but within their own nations.

00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:39.159
You might remember a mini-series we did on The Cambridge Five.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.814
It involved young British men, some of whom had reached the very top of

00:14:43.824 --> 00:14:48.849
British society but were secretly passing information to the Soviet Union.

00:14:49.969 --> 00:14:51.919
If you haven’t listened to that miniseries already,

00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:57.554
I highly recommend it; it’s episodes 346 through 348.

00:14:58.479 --> 00:15:03.529
Perhaps unsurprisingly, modern-day spying is far less about tuxedos,

00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:07.599
martinis, and seduction than spy movies would have you believe.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:13.625
The days of glamorous field agents infiltrating cocktail parties to gather state secrets

00:15:14.087 --> 00:15:18.935
are largely a thing of the past, or rather, the thing of Ian Fleming’s imagination.

00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:24.898
Instead, today’s espionage is overwhelmingly focused on information

00:15:24.898 --> 00:15:30.042
gathering, often from a distance and without the need for a human presence.

00:15:31.002 --> 00:15:36.742
It is no longer about humans extracting information from other humans but is more likely to

00:15:36.742 --> 00:15:43.812
be algorithms and viruses extracting information from or damaging the systems of enemy states.

00:15:44.912 --> 00:15:49.752
Now the question isn’t about how persuasive your spies are or how

00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:54.412
well they blend into a crowd, but how advanced your technology is.

00:15:55.882 --> 00:16:00.882
And the nature of it is that it never reaches the public domain; it is

00:16:01.072 --> 00:16:06.682
kept secret, hidden in classified dossiers, known by only a select few.

00:16:07.912 --> 00:16:09.562
But not always.

00:16:10.262 --> 00:16:12.232
Take cyber espionage, for example.

00:16:13.302 --> 00:16:17.692
In 2010, the United States and Israel carried out a highly

00:16:17.692 --> 00:16:21.502
sophisticated cyber-attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.

00:16:22.752 --> 00:16:27.872
Known as Stuxnet, this malware was able to infiltrate computer

00:16:27.872 --> 00:16:32.652
systems and sabotage centrifuges used for uranium enrichment.

00:16:33.382 --> 00:16:39.122
It was espionage, sabotage, and warfare rolled into one—and all

00:16:39.142 --> 00:16:43.802
of it done without a single human stepping foot on Iranian soil.

00:16:45.062 --> 00:16:50.672
This is a prime example of modern spying, much more likely to be conducted from thousands

00:16:50.672 --> 00:16:56.282
of kilometres away, surrounded by walls of screens, rather than through a hushed

00:16:56.312 --> 00:17:01.392
conversation on a park bench or an exchange of documents in a brown paper envelope.

00:17:02.602 --> 00:17:08.662
And a modern spy, or modern intelligence agent, I should say, is less likely to look like

00:17:08.662 --> 00:17:14.622
Sean Connery or Pierce Brosnan and much more like, well, someone like Edward Snowden.

00:17:15.942 --> 00:17:20.432
Edward Snowden, in many ways, epitomises modern espionage.

00:17:21.582 --> 00:17:27.632
As you will probably know already or will remember from Episode 434, he first

00:17:27.632 --> 00:17:33.452
worked as a contractor for the NSA, the National Security Agency, before going

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:38.537
rogue and handing over a bucketload of classified information to Wikileaks.

00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:45.501
His revelations about the NSA showed the extent to which intelligence agencies now

00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:51.471
rely on vast amounts of data collected through digital means—tracking emails, phone

00:17:51.471 --> 00:17:57.451
calls, and even internet searches—to monitor not just enemies, but their own citizens.

00:17:58.901 --> 00:18:03.691
Of course, not all spy stories are as dramatic or public as Edward Snowden’s.

00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:07.531
Sometimes, they’re far more subtle—and personal.

00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:09.881
So, here we go.

00:18:10.331 --> 00:18:14.401
I promised to tell you about a personal spy-related experience.

00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:18.311
A friend of mine from university had a girlfriend.

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:23.111
She was nice, always quite quiet, and fiercely intelligent.

00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:29.481
She spoke both Mandarin and Cantonese; I think her parents were originally from Hong Kong.

00:18:30.431 --> 00:18:33.441
She didn’t go to the same university as us; she was

00:18:33.441 --> 00:18:36.731
studying engineering at Oxford, and we were in London.

00:18:37.741 --> 00:18:41.231
She would come down to visit on the weekend, and there would be

00:18:41.231 --> 00:18:46.331
occasional jokes about her being a prime candidate to get a job as a spy.

00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:53.171
And after university, she moved to a small town to work, she said,

00:18:53.511 --> 00:18:57.618
for an engineering company that made landing gear for aeroplanes.

00:18:59.051 --> 00:19:01.711
The town she moved to was called Cheltenham.

00:19:03.461 --> 00:19:08.681
It is a relatively small spa town, and there is, I should add, an

00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:12.111
engineering company there that does make equipment for aeroplanes.

00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:18.131
But few of us believed she had ever walked through the doors of that company.

00:19:19.023 --> 00:19:22.687
The biggest employer in Cheltenham is GCHQ.

00:19:23.457 --> 00:19:28.207
It´s the UK’s spy agency, the British equivalent of the NSA.

00:19:29.607 --> 00:19:34.147
We would joke with her about being a spy, and of course, she would always deny

00:19:34.147 --> 00:19:38.087
it and claim that her job was just something boring to do with aeroplanes.

00:19:39.177 --> 00:19:43.897
And a few years later, her company, so she said, posted her to Hong Kong.

00:19:44.917 --> 00:19:50.205
It seemed even more certain than before, especially because she didn’t seem to remember many

00:19:50.225 --> 00:19:55.595
details about where her office was in Hong Kong or the type of work she was supposedly doing.

00:19:56.995 --> 00:20:01.825
Now, she always maintained that she was not a spy and my friend and

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:06.395
her are no longer together, so I cannot tell you for sure either way.

00:20:07.305 --> 00:20:14.135
Spy or no spy, all I will say is that for someone who supposedly spent 10 years working

00:20:14.135 --> 00:20:19.435
for an aeroplane equipment company, she certainly did not know very much about aeroplanes.

00:20:21.075 --> 00:20:26.965
OK then, that is it for the history of espionage and the weird and murky world of spies.

00:20:27.525 --> 00:20:30.705
As a reminder, this was part of a three-part mini-series

00:20:30.945 --> 00:20:33.555
on the loose theme of mystery and the unknown.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.580
Part one was on secret societies, and next we are going to

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:41.700
take a look at the very mysterious world of lost civilisations.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:47.080
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.870
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

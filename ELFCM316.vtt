Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:16.804
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:20.984
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:27.084
I'm Alastair Budge, and this episode is going to be released on November 18th.

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.054
Why am I saying this?

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:33.934
Well, if you’re a football fan, you probably know what’s happening this weekend.

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:42.844
This Sunday, at Al Bayt Stadium, about 35km north of Doha in Qatar, will see the start of

00:00:42.844 --> 00:00:48.404
the next Fifa World Cup, the most highly-anticipated footballing competition in the world.

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:53.024
It’s where the world’s best footballing nations go head to head.

00:00:53.294 --> 00:00:55.254
National pride is at stake.

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:57.474
And there’s glory to be won.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:04.714
But over the years World Cups have also been home to some serious controversy and scandal.

00:01:05.084 --> 00:01:08.494
So, in this episode we will be looking at five of

00:01:08.494 --> 00:01:12.004
the most controversial events of World Cup history.

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:17.574
From misbehaviour on the pitch through to murder off it, the

00:01:17.574 --> 00:01:21.304
next 20 minutes will involve politics, war and corruption.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:27.924
Oh, and we’ll also have time for 5 weird and wonderful facts at the end of this episode.

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:32.981
OK then, let’s get into it and talk about the most

00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:36.471
controversial events in the history of the World Cup.

00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:42.121
We will start with one of the game’s most gifted players, but also

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:47.271
one of its most controversial - an Argentinian named Diego Maradona.

00:01:47.675 --> 00:01:53.241
Maradona is, simply put, one of the most iconic players in footballing history.

00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:58.051
To many, he is the single greatest footballer of all time.

00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:02.871
To others, he is the sport’s most infamous cheat.

00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:05.951
So, why is he so divisive?

00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:10.511
Well, if you’d like to learn more about this man and you haven’t listened

00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:15.181
to episode number 146 yet, then you can listen to that afterwards.

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:20.621
But as far as the World Cup is concerned, there is one match that perfectly

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:26.221
captures the enigma that Maradona was - part villain, part genius.

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:32.701
It was the 22nd of June 1986, in Mexico City.

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:39.981
Over 110,000 people were packed into the Azteca Stadium to watch the

00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:44.061
World Cup quarter final between England and Maradona’s Argentina.

00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.341
After a goalless first half, six minutes into the

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.841
second half of the match Argentina were on the attack.

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.701
Advancing close to the England goal, the ball was kicked high

00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.111
in the air towards the England goalkeeper, Peter Shilton.

00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:10.141
Shilton was 1 meter 83 tall, and towered over Maradona, who was just 1 meter 65.

00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:16.071
With such a big height difference, as well as the fact that goalkeepers are allowed, of

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:22.251
course, to use their hands, it should have been a routine catch for the English goalkeeper.

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:28.971
But as the ball was about to drop into his hands, Maradona jumped up,

00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:33.911
hung in the air, and the ball ended up in the back of England’s net.

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:42.111
Maradona turned and began to celebrate, while furious England players pleaded with the referee.

00:03:42.711 --> 00:03:48.041
How had the tiny Argentinian managed to outjump Shilton for the header?

00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:54.791
TV replays revealed that Maradona hadn’t headed the ball, as was

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:59.711
first assumed, but punched the ball into the goal with his hand.

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:07.621
The referee, who didn’t have a clear view of the incident, saw nothing wrong and awarded the goal.

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:10.151
1-0 to Argentina.

00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:16.481
It was, as Maradona would say after the match, a goal scored “a

00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:20.541
little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God.”

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:26.474
Still furious about Maradona’s cheating, minutes later the England players and fans could

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:32.261
do nothing as the little Argentinian dribbled around almost the entire England team and

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:37.391
scored what is widely considered to be the greatest goal in the history of football.

00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:42.241
Within the space of a few minutes, the world had seen the

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:46.621
two sides of Diego Maradona - the villain and the genius.

00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:53.221
Argentina went on to win the match 2-1 and England were knocked out of the

00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:58.001
World Cup, and Maradona led Argentina to win the tournament, cementing his

00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:02.931
status as the best - and most controversial - player in world football.

00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.661
Our next World Cup controversy also involves a South

00:05:07.661 --> 00:05:11.821
American player, but this, sadly, ends in tragedy.

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:20.541
On the 22nd of June, Colombia played the United States in a group stage match of the 1994 World Cup.

00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:27.611
The Colombian team had performed well in the build-up to the tournament, and expectations were high.

00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:34.481
Andrés Escobar, a talented defender known as ‘The Gentleman of Football”, was

00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:39.081
expected to lead the Colombian team to the latter stages of the tournament.

00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:45.261
But in the first half of the match against the Americans, Escobar accidentally

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:50.051
scored an own goal, he scored a goal for the United States, not for Colombia.

00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:56.051
Colombia went on to lose the match, and were eliminated in the group stage of the tournament.

00:05:57.091 --> 00:06:02.541
There was some surprise and inevitable disappointment after the country's

00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:07.091
most dependable player made such a mistake, but that’s football, right?

00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:08.601
These things happen.

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:14.181
Most people would shrug it off and put such an event down to bad

00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:19.251
luck, but for some people back home in Colombia it wasn’t that simple.

00:06:20.646 --> 00:06:25.856
After all of the hope and expectation surrounding the Colombian team was lost, for some

00:06:26.236 --> 00:06:32.786
Escobar’s own goal was not only about football, but it became a matter of life and death.

00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:40.536
When Escobar returned to his hometown of Medellin a few weeks later, he tried to forget all about

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:46.986
his mistake and went to a nightclub to blow off some steam with his friends, to have some fun.

00:06:48.196 --> 00:06:52.966
Unfortunately for him, some people hadn’t forgotten about it.

00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:58.026
Outside the club, a group of men confronted Escobar.

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:04.436
One pulled out a pistol and shot Escobar six times.

00:07:05.886 --> 00:07:09.846
Witnesses claimed that the shooter shouted “goal” each

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:13.226
time he pulled the trigger, for each time he was shot.

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:19.626
45 minutes later, Andrés Escobar, Colombia’s best known footballer - the

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:24.696
‘gentleman of football’ - died in hospital at the age of just 27.

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:27.776
But who was the shooter?

00:07:28.206 --> 00:07:32.326
Was he simply a deranged football fan who took his revenge on

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:35.666
the man he blamed for Colombia’s early exit from the tournament?

00:07:36.676 --> 00:07:37.296
Not quite.

00:07:38.226 --> 00:07:42.516
The following evening, when police arrested the gunman, it came to

00:07:42.516 --> 00:07:47.016
light, or was revealed, that the truth was much darker than that.

00:07:48.396 --> 00:07:54.606
The alleged shooter, a man named Humberto Castro Muñoz, was a bodyguard for the

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:59.276
Gallon brothers, two powerful drug traffickers, or ‘narcos’ as they were known.

00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:03.146
So why was Escobar killed?

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:07.486
The Gallon brothers, who were betting on Colombia’s World Cup

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:11.496
matches, lost a huge amount of money after Escobar’s own-goal.

00:08:12.656 --> 00:08:16.586
Police believed the brothers had ordered Escobar’s execution in

00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:21.336
revenge for his own goal, and decided that Muñoz was the man to do it.

00:08:22.926 --> 00:08:26.406
OK, moving on to our next controversy, controversy

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:30.536
number 3, and this takes us, in fact, to the Middle East.

00:08:31.806 --> 00:08:37.936
At the 1982 World Cup in Spain, Kuwait made its only World Cup appearance and

00:08:38.086 --> 00:08:43.106
it was one of the strangest - and most controversial - in World Cup history.

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:48.096
In one of their group stage games, the Kuwaitis quickly

00:08:48.096 --> 00:08:51.326
found themselves losing to a powerful French team.

00:08:51.996 --> 00:08:57.726
More and more goals went in, and things were beginning to get a little embarrassing.

00:08:58.936 --> 00:09:04.926
But then, in the middle of the game, the Kuwait players simply stopped playing.

00:09:05.946 --> 00:09:09.964
As they stood still, the French midfielder Alain Giresse

00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:14.236
scored a fourth goal for France, taking it to 4-1.

00:09:15.296 --> 00:09:18.796
The Kuwaiti players claimed that they had heard a

00:09:18.796 --> 00:09:22.716
whistle from the crowd and confused it for the referee’s.

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:30.286
With the Kuwait team refusing to play or restart the match, confusion filled the stadium.

00:09:31.086 --> 00:09:32.936
Had the referee blown his whistle?

00:09:33.196 --> 00:09:34.636
Should the goal be allowed?

00:09:35.536 --> 00:09:42.235
The players and coaches protested to the referee, and looked desperately up into the stands.

00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:46.725
They were gesturing and communicating with someone watching the game.

00:09:47.345 --> 00:09:48.945
But who was it?

00:09:50.105 --> 00:09:55.105
Then, a man wearing a traditional white robe and red headscarf stood up.

00:09:56.175 --> 00:10:02.635
Incredibly, he gestured for the players to leave the pitch, he signalled for them to get off.

00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:09.205
After more confusion, the man signalled that he was coming down to the pitch.

00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:15.325
The man was Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, a Kuwaiti Prince

00:10:15.325 --> 00:10:19.735
but also a key figure in the Kuwaiti football association.

00:10:20.457 --> 00:10:22.705
He made his way down from the stands.

00:10:22.935 --> 00:10:26.865
Again, he ordered all his players off the pitch,

00:10:26.895 --> 00:10:30.225
and argued furiously with the referee and officials.

00:10:31.495 --> 00:10:38.825
Incredibly, the Soviet referee, Miroslav Stupar disallowed the goal, the first and only time

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:45.715
a spectator changed the decision of a referee in World Cup, and perhaps footballing history.

00:10:46.675 --> 00:10:52.549
It didn’t make a whole lot of difference, though, and France still went on to win 4-1.

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:57.419
Kuwait’s short lived World Cup experience was over, Prince Fahid was given

00:10:57.419 --> 00:11:02.939
a large fine, and the referee, Miroslav Stupar, was banned from refereeing.

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:06.649
OK, controversy number four.

00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:11.189
This is a more recent one, involving France again, and I

00:11:11.189 --> 00:11:15.439
imagine it's one that many of you might remember watching live.

00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:21.239
The 2006 World Cup, which was held in Germany, was the swansong,

00:11:21.309 --> 00:11:25.249
or last performance, of one of the game’s greatest players.

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.379
Zinedine Zidane, a Frenchman who played most of his career

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:34.349
in Italy and Spain, was one of world football’s true icons.

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:40.949
He was known for his grace and intelligence on the pitch, and after a highly successful

00:11:40.969 --> 00:11:46.929
club and international career, the world of football tuned in to watch the last game of

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:54.229
Zidane’s long and illustrious career on the 9th of July 2006 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:58.479
France versus Italy, in the World Cup final.

00:11:59.249 --> 00:12:03.699
The stage was set for Zidane to end his playing career in glory.

00:12:04.449 --> 00:12:08.689
He had been the standout player of not just the French team, but the

00:12:08.689 --> 00:12:13.799
entire tournament, and had captained France all the way to the final.

00:12:14.669 --> 00:12:19.959
He started the game well, drawing oohs and ahhs from the crowd, and in

00:12:19.959 --> 00:12:25.159
the 7th minute he put the French 1-0 up with a goal from the penalty spot.

00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:30.609
But the Italians equaled in the 19th minute with a header from

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:35.079
defender Marco Materazzi, and the game grew more and more tense.

00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:40.759
Zidane dominated the game, almost scoring another, but neither

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:45.069
team could score the winning goal and the game went to extra time.

00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:50.499
The anticipation for what felt like Zidane’s inevitable triumph was growing.

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:55.539
But then something absolutely jaw-dropping happened.

00:12:55.669 --> 00:12:59.359
Something that left the entire football world speechless.

00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:05.395
In the 109th minute of the game, the game’s two goalscorers,

00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:10.139
Zidane and Materazzi, began jostling, fighting for the ball.

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:18.339
After Materazzi pulled on Zidane's shirt, Zidane set off running to help his team defend the goal.

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:24.589
But Materazzi shouted something to him, Zidane stopped, and turned.

00:13:25.589 --> 00:13:32.589
Drawing back his head, he stepped forward and head butted Matarazzi firmly in the chest.

00:13:33.584 --> 00:13:37.080
The Italian dropped to the floor, and his teammates

00:13:37.099 --> 00:13:39.689
cried out, trying to get the referee’s attention.

00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:47.529
After checking with his assistant, the referee gave Zidane a red card, he sent him off the pitch.

00:13:48.229 --> 00:13:52.535
The football world watched in shock as Zinedine Zidane walked

00:13:52.605 --> 00:13:56.979
closely past the trophy everyone thought he had been destined to win.

00:13:57.869 --> 00:14:02.999
As you may remember, Italy went on to win 5-3 on penalties.

00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:07.739
The dream ending to Zidane’s career, and French hopes of another

00:14:07.739 --> 00:14:11.369
World Cup triumph, were thrown away in a moment of madness.

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:15.849
So, what did Materazzi say to Zidane to provoke him so?

00:14:16.893 --> 00:14:21.929
Zidane has never confirmed publicly what it was but many believe

00:14:21.939 --> 00:14:25.299
it was something incredibly insulting about Zidane’s family.

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:32.169
In 2020, Materazzi said in an interview that Zidane had told him 'I'll give you my shirt

00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:37.699
later', to which Materazzi replied that "he'd rather have his sister than his shirt."

00:14:39.139 --> 00:14:43.999
Some football journalists have even claimed that the Italian coach, Marcello Lippi,

00:14:44.169 --> 00:14:49.169
who was Zidane’s manager at Juventus when the Frenchman was playing in Italy, had some

00:14:49.543 --> 00:14:55.359
dirt, some secret, about his private life, and told Materazzi to use it against him.

00:14:56.289 --> 00:15:00.299
Whatever it was, clearly it was offensive enough to have provoked such a

00:15:00.299 --> 00:15:04.569
reaction from one of the world’s most successful footballing professionals.

00:15:05.479 --> 00:15:10.359
Now, our final World Cup controversy is another one involving France

00:15:10.359 --> 00:15:16.389
and Italy, but for this one we need to go back decades, to 1938.

00:15:17.259 --> 00:15:21.979
I imagine even our older listeners might not have been around to watch this one live.

00:15:22.389 --> 00:15:26.009
But if you know anything about European history, you will know

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:30.199
that the late-1930s were tense times politically across Europe.

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:37.559
Italy, ruled by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, had been using sports, in particular

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:44.839
football, to promote its ideology and project a sense of Italian nationalism at home and abroad.

00:15:45.809 --> 00:15:50.439
Italy had won the previous 1934 World Cup, which was hosted in

00:15:50.439 --> 00:15:55.049
Italy, but was dogged by accusations of bribery and match-fixing.

00:15:56.269 --> 00:16:00.429
With Mussolini siding with the fascists in the Spanish Civil War and

00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:05.679
anti-fascist resistance bubbling across Europe, the Italians arrival in France

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:12.029
in 1938 came at a tense time of anti-Italian and anti-fascist sentiment.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:19.099
The Italians, on the other hand, were keen to prove their doubters wrong and show the

00:16:19.099 --> 00:16:23.969
world that they had won the last World Cup without any backroom deals, or corruption.

00:16:25.199 --> 00:16:32.179
When the Italian squad came to Marseille, 3,000 people took to the streets to protest against

00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:37.979
the team, the regime it represented, and the political ideology it was playing on behalf of.

00:16:39.119 --> 00:16:42.429
As you have probably guessed, this World Cup controversy

00:16:42.619 --> 00:16:46.879
was much more symbolic than a handball or a headbutt.

00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:50.999
In such politically charged times, the results of

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:54.829
football matches were viewed as political wins and losses.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:17:01.729
Now, as you will likely know, both France and Italy traditionally play in blue.

00:17:02.539 --> 00:17:07.479
When they play each other, clearly they can’t both play in blue, as that would be confusing.

00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:12.769
One team, normally the “away” team, needs to wear a different colour.

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:19.129
So when they were drawn against one another in the quarter finals of the tournament on June

00:17:19.179 --> 00:17:27.889
12th, France, as hosts, kept their blue kit and Italy were told to wear an alternative white kit.

00:17:28.979 --> 00:17:33.909
But sensing the chance to make a political statement, Mussolini

00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:38.999
ordered his team to wear black - the symbol of his fascist paramilitary

00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:44.459
organisation - and the team gave the fascist salute before the match kicked off.

00:17:45.269 --> 00:17:49.129
There was a furious reaction from the French crowd, but

00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:52.719
their team could do little to stop the Italians on the pitch.

00:17:53.609 --> 00:18:00.269
Italy won the match 3-1 and went on to win the tournament, not only defending its World Cup

00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:05.939
crown but inflaming political tensions just months before the outbreak of war in Europe.

00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:13.629
On that day in 1938, the match had taken on political significance and became about much

00:18:13.639 --> 00:18:19.789
more than football - it wasn’t simply two teams, but two ideologies battling on the pitch.

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:27.059
In fact, and here is some trivia for you, the 1938 World Cup was the last to be held before

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:32.529
the outbreak of the Second World War, and as a result of their back to back victories in

00:18:32.669 --> 00:18:41.309
1934 and 1938, the Italians were the World Champions until 1950 - a grand total of 16 years.

00:18:42.959 --> 00:18:49.049
Now, before we finish, here are five interesting bits of World Cup trivia, or facts, for you.

00:18:49.969 --> 00:18:55.599
Our first fact is that the first FIFA World Cup was not held in Italy or France

00:18:55.599 --> 00:19:00.419
or Brazil or Germany, or any other football powerhouse as you might expect,

00:19:00.659 --> 00:19:06.042
but in the small South American country of Uruguay all the way back in 1930.

00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:13.629
And as many of you know, the World Cup is not just a sporting event but a cultural celebration.

00:19:14.109 --> 00:19:19.189
As a result, fans, especially England fans, tend to enjoy themselves.

00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:23.819
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, for example, a

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:28.929
staggering 750,000 litres of beer were sold in stadiums.

00:19:29.649 --> 00:19:32.879
With Qatar’s strict laws on alcohol consumption, it

00:19:32.879 --> 00:19:35.929
will be interesting to see how fans manage this year…

00:19:37.439 --> 00:19:41.619
Trivia point number three is to do with the World Cup’s popularity.

00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:47.971
Now, you probably know the World Cup is popular, but quite how popular might surprise you.

00:19:48.879 --> 00:19:54.539
At the last World Cup, the 2018 World Cup in Russia, over half of the

00:19:54.539 --> 00:20:01.469
world’s population, a total of 3.572 billion people, tuned in to watch.

00:20:02.579 --> 00:20:06.989
Now, fun fact number 4 doesn’t involve people, but dogs.

00:20:07.529 --> 00:20:10.069
Specifically, a dog named Pickles.

00:20:11.229 --> 00:20:17.349
In 1966, the World Cup trophy, known as the Jules Rimet trophy, was stolen.

00:20:18.209 --> 00:20:19.409
Where had it gone?

00:20:19.429 --> 00:20:25.699
How was it possible that the World Cup trophy, supposedly under strict security, could be stolen?

00:20:26.989 --> 00:20:31.589
Fortunately, a few days later a dog walker called David Corbett

00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:35.679
found a strange looking package while walking his dog Pickles.

00:20:36.749 --> 00:20:42.609
Opening it up, Corbett was amazed that he was holding the World Cup in his hands.

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:49.379
Many people in England say Pickles was good luck, because 1966 was

00:20:49.379 --> 00:20:53.119
the first - and only - time that England has won the World Cup.

00:20:54.329 --> 00:20:59.849
Finally, many of you may know that the 2022 World Cup is already causing

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:03.649
some controversy before the starting whistle has even been blown.

00:21:04.689 --> 00:21:11.279
The 2022 Qatar World Cup will be the first held in the Arab World, and the first to be

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:16.399
held during the winter, a big change as World Cups are usually held in the summertime.

00:21:17.189 --> 00:21:21.649
This is due to the intense summer heat in Qatar, and as

00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:25.019
a result each stadium will be entirely air conditioned.

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:32.459
FIFA, the international football body, and Qatar, a country that has never qualified for a World

00:21:32.459 --> 00:21:37.979
Cup itself, have been widely accused of bribery and corruption during the selection process.

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:42.729
And sadly, the Qatar World Cup is controversial not just

00:21:42.739 --> 00:21:46.319
for corruption, but also for the use of slave labour.

00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:52.779
Reports have suggested that as many as 7,000 workers have died

00:21:52.979 --> 00:21:56.509
trying to build the facilities and stadiums for the event.

00:21:57.499 --> 00:22:03.679
So, whatever happens this winter, whoever wins the tournament, one thing is for sure:

00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:10.296
like all World Cups, there’s sure to be some controversy - both on and off the pitch.

00:22:13.046 --> 00:22:17.726
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on World Cup controversies.

00:22:18.096 --> 00:22:22.896
Whether you are a die-hard football fan and you’ll be watching every match, or you couldn’t

00:22:22.906 --> 00:22:27.746
even explain the offside rule, I hope it was a fun one, and that you learned something new.

00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:31.826
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:22:32.196 --> 00:22:35.456
Can you remember any of the incidents we talked about today?

00:22:35.876 --> 00:22:39.376
What other controversies didn’t we include but you can remember?

00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:42.886
And what do you think about the Qatar World Cup?

00:22:43.426 --> 00:22:45.166
What do you think about England’s chances even?

00:22:45.566 --> 00:22:49.066
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:17.195
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:21.635
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:29.255
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of a three-part mini-series on Ancient Rome.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:34.555
In part one we looked at the politics of Ancient Rome and in part

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:39.195
three we will look at the unfortunate and gory lives of gladiators

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:45.615
But part two, in today’s episode we are going to be talking about slavery in ancient Rome.

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:52.835
It is believed that slaves made up around 20% of the entire population of the Roman empire

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:59.082
and the entire function of society and growth of the economy became reliant upon slave labour.

00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:04.652
Despite their vital role, they were considered the lowest people in society

00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:09.342
with no freedom or rights, they were simply the property of their master.

00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:12.452
And today, we will tell their story.

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:17.756
OK then, let’s talk about ancient Roman slaves.

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:23.286
Imagine the horror of being taken from your home, family, everything you

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:27.426
know, at the hands of fearsome soldiers who have marched into your town,

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:32.136
killed your leaders and now threaten to kill you if you do not obey.

00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:36.886
Your only option to survive is to do as instructed and

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:40.666
submit to the Roman who has a sword held to your chest.

00:01:41.436 --> 00:01:46.696
You go with him and are put into chains before being pushed into

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:50.456
a horse and carriage and taken away from everything you know.

00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:56.226
You eventually arrive at a crowded and chaotic market where you’re stripped

00:01:56.416 --> 00:02:01.826
naked and chained to a bunch of strangers, none who speak your language.

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:07.126
Then a sign is put around your neck advertising your price.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:14.226
In the eyes of your captors, and those examining you at the market, you are a mere object for sale.

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:19.126
And this is how you feel, standing there while passersby

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:22.096
decide whether you’re worthy of the asking price.

00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:27.846
From the moment you were taken by the soldier, your rights and freedom were taken from you.

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:32.676
You can be legally tortured and beaten, you cannot own property,

00:02:32.956 --> 00:02:36.986
your life will now be completely dictated by whoever buys you.

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:44.096
All you can do is stand terrified and alone, waiting to see whose property you

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:49.446
will become, and praying that someday, just someday, you might regain your freedom.

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:56.526
Whether you had been a successful business owner, a skilled weaver, a loving parent or a

00:02:56.576 --> 00:03:02.076
convicted criminal, this could be your fate if you were captured by the Romans during war.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.386
The fate of a slave.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:11.889
Slavery was present from the very start of the Republic when, as legend has it, Rome’s founder,

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:18.069
Romulus, gave fathers the right to sell their children into slavery for financial gain.

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.609
However, Rome was not the first ancient city to use slaves and throughout the ancient

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:32.199
world, from Greece to Egypt to Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq, slavery was common practice.

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:38.039
Clearly, if you try to put aside the heinous moral element for a

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:42.359
minute, it was convenient to have someone to work for you for free.

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.729
Although it might seem unthinkable to us, perhaps it’s easier to understand if you

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:53.758
try to imagine that slaves were considered more like objects than human beings.

00:03:54.128 --> 00:04:00.218
They had no rights or citizenship which meant they could not vote or own property and unlike

00:04:00.238 --> 00:04:05.998
normal Roman citizens, slaves could be tortured and be killed without being given a trial.

00:04:07.498 --> 00:04:14.238
Despite all this, there is little evidence to suggest that the average Roman questioned slavery.

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:20.138
For many, it was simply a fact of life and many believed that in

00:04:20.138 --> 00:04:24.408
order to have freedom, there must also be the opposite, slavery.

00:04:25.468 --> 00:04:30.738
The Greek philosopher Aristotle even proposed that slavery was a natural

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:36.748
thing and that human beings were born into two types: slaves and non-slaves.

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:42.958
As unbelievable as this might sound to us today, these were the real

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:47.778
beliefs of the Romans so there was never really any widespread calls

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.648
for the abolishment of slavery throughout the Republic or the Empire.

00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:58.738
But Rome was different from other civilisations, not due to Roman beliefs around

00:04:58.738 --> 00:05:03.838
slaves but because of the sheer amount of them and their presence through the land.

00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:09.578
They became a huge free workforce that Roman society relied upon.

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:14.598
Although it had existed since the birth of Rome, the slave industry

00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:19.198
first saw an immense boom during a period called the Punic Wars.

00:05:19.808 --> 00:05:24.878
The first war alone, in which Rome defeated the Carthaginians from North Africa

00:05:25.008 --> 00:05:32.808
in 241 BC, gave Rome at least 75,000 war prisoners who were then taken as slaves.

00:05:33.828 --> 00:05:37.888
These numbers only grew when Rome eventually defeated the city of

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:45.638
Carthage in 168 BC capturing 250,000 Carthaginians who ended up as slaves.

00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:52.318
By the end of the 1st century BC, it’s estimated that there were between 1-2 million

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:57.868
slaves, which was about 20 to 30% of the population of the Italian peninsula.

00:05:59.188 --> 00:06:05.078
If we are to try to find one positive element of slavery, or at least one element in

00:06:05.078 --> 00:06:10.298
which Roman slavery was more equal than more more modern forms of slavery, it is that

00:06:10.308 --> 00:06:15.258
Roman slavery was not based on race, it wasn’t based on the colour of one’s skin.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:22.038
Indeed, there were slaves from many places like Greece, Germany, North Africa and Syria.

00:06:22.628 --> 00:06:27.918
Even Romans could become slaves, as citizens who committed violent crimes could

00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:32.708
be punished by having their citizenship removed, and then being sold into slavery.

00:06:33.798 --> 00:06:36.518
And shockingly, it wasn’t just adults.

00:06:36.978 --> 00:06:41.958
Innocent children could face the same fate, as parents could sell their children

00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:47.198
into slavery, following the law laid down by Romulus in Rome’s earliest days.

00:06:48.138 --> 00:06:53.788
Sadly, any child born to slave parents was automatically considered a slave too.

00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:58.318
Some people were also forced to sell themselves into slavery

00:06:58.558 --> 00:07:02.058
if, for example, they were facing financial difficulties.

00:07:03.058 --> 00:07:08.598
These instances though, of Romans either selling themselves as slaves or

00:07:08.598 --> 00:07:12.538
selling their children as slaves, were far less frequent than people who

00:07:12.538 --> 00:07:17.348
were sold into slavery after being captured and kept as a prisoner of war.

00:07:18.128 --> 00:07:20.808
So what would happen once they were captured?

00:07:21.388 --> 00:07:25.148
Well as you heard at the start, prisoners would be swiftly

00:07:25.148 --> 00:07:29.048
transported to markets where they would be sold like animals.

00:07:29.888 --> 00:07:37.058
One market on the Greek island of Delos had up to 10,000 slaves for sale in a single day.

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:43.178
Stood naked and chained up, a slave would have a sign hanging from their

00:07:43.178 --> 00:07:48.078
neck to advertise their price, as these prices could vary quite a bit.

00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:54.598
Men usually cost more than women who were, in turn, more expensive than children.

00:07:55.398 --> 00:08:00.238
But within these groups prices really depended on the individual’s skills.

00:08:01.188 --> 00:08:06.798
Also as women would be able to provide a slave owner with more slaves by producing

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:13.299
children, women who were unable to conceive were much cheaper, they were valued far less.

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:18.919
Shockingly, if a slave owner had not been told about a woman’s fertility

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:23.399
issues they could claim a refund and return the woman to the market.

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:27.249
This goes to show just how badly these people were

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:31.339
viewed as simply material items to their slave owners.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:37.749
Nonetheless, as entire populations were captured the skills of slaves varied

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:42.129
hugely, and there would be people who were trained professionals from every

00:08:42.129 --> 00:08:46.959
walk of life, including doctors, accountants, hairdressers and craftsman.

00:08:48.129 --> 00:08:52.009
For those who had these types of skills, their price was far higher

00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:56.109
than those without, who would go into manual labour in the countryside.

00:08:57.099 --> 00:09:01.569
Records surviving from the first three centuries AD show that the

00:09:01.609 --> 00:09:07.409
average price for an unskilled slave was around 2000 sesterces.

00:09:08.099 --> 00:09:12.119
In contrast, a person skilled in cultivating grapevines,

00:09:12.129 --> 00:09:16.379
for example, cost between 6000 and 8000 sesterces.

00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:24.279
For context, a Roman foot soldier received a yearly salary of 900 sesterces, an army commander

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:30.919
was paid 15 times more, while a senator had to have properties worth at least 1 million sesterces.

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:38.215
In other words, an unskilled slave would cost just over twice the average salary for a Roman

00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:45.325
soldier, and a Roman senator would have to have property worth about 500 unskilled slaves.

00:09:46.505 --> 00:09:52.845
It's not surprising, then, that 49% of slaves were owned by the patricians or senators,

00:09:53.015 --> 00:09:58.275
who made up just 1.5% of Rome’s entire population at the start of the Republic.

00:10:00.085 --> 00:10:06.695
One particularly wealthy Roman consul, Marcus Licinius Crassus, who you may remember from the last

00:10:06.695 --> 00:10:13.825
episode, had so many slaves that he kept 500 just for carrying out building works on his properties.

00:10:14.645 --> 00:10:20.735
However, it was not only the patricians or senators who owned slaves and it was also common for

00:10:20.745 --> 00:10:27.535
less wealthy Romans such as merchants, craftsman and retired soldiers to own at least one slave.

00:10:28.695 --> 00:10:33.055
In the city, slaves could work alongside plebians, normal

00:10:33.055 --> 00:10:37.105
people, in settings like libraries, markets and public baths.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:43.865
They would manage the houses of the rich, cleaning, looking after children, dressing their masters,

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:49.487
and importantly, cooking, which was another skill that was highly prized, highly sought after.

00:10:50.854 --> 00:10:54.714
Some of the elite even bought slaves to follow them around in

00:10:54.714 --> 00:10:59.424
an entourage, a group, and this became a bit of a status symbol.

00:11:00.744 --> 00:11:04.344
But aside from these roles, some slaves were kept for

00:11:04.384 --> 00:11:08.064
entertainment purposes and became actors or gladiators.

00:11:09.284 --> 00:11:14.424
The strongest and fittest men were often selected to become gladiators, and

00:11:14.594 --> 00:11:18.864
they would be specially trained to fight in amphitheatres like the Colosseum.

00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:25.364
Gladiators can even be said to be celebrity slaves due to the immense popularity of the

00:11:25.364 --> 00:11:30.454
sport, which we will go into in much greater detail in part three of this mini-series.

00:11:31.304 --> 00:11:36.254
But, contrary to what you might think, there was a fate worse than becoming a gladiator.

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:40.647
And that was those slaves who became “actors”.

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:46.107
These were usually criminals, and their fate could be extremely grim.

00:11:46.737 --> 00:11:52.607
Yes, while nowadays thousands of people flock to Los Angeles hoping to make it big

00:11:52.727 --> 00:11:57.327
as a Hollywood actor, you certainly didn’t want to become an actor in Ancient Rome.

00:11:58.257 --> 00:11:59.707
Why, you might be thinking?

00:12:00.107 --> 00:12:05.377
Well, actors were involved in gladiatorial battles, with plays being put

00:12:05.377 --> 00:12:09.097
on between the main event, the actual battles between the gladiators.

00:12:09.957 --> 00:12:13.947
But these actors wouldn’t fight each other, they weren’t gladiators.

00:12:14.397 --> 00:12:19.317
Their job would be to play the role of a character from an ancient story.

00:12:20.077 --> 00:12:22.057
And they had to follow the script.

00:12:22.547 --> 00:12:25.587
When their character died, so did they.

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:29.677
This meant that actors would be killed in the most dramatic

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:33.767
and horrible ways, all for the entertainment of the audiences.

00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:40.187
For example, a slave was burnt alive as he performed the death of Hercules

00:12:40.407 --> 00:12:44.757
who, in classical mythology, died after throwing himself on a fire.

00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:50.254
Another example is of an actor who was playing the mythological figure

00:12:50.447 --> 00:12:56.627
Orpheus, and as in the myth, the actor was torn apart by wild animals.

00:12:57.457 --> 00:13:01.867
These types of roles were, clearly, some of the worst for slaves.

00:13:02.317 --> 00:13:04.707
But it wasn’t all this bad.

00:13:05.137 --> 00:13:09.577
There were many different roles within Roman society and a slave’s

00:13:09.587 --> 00:13:12.947
life would vary greatly depending on which role they were given.

00:13:13.957 --> 00:13:18.357
For example, those who were servants within the households of the Roman

00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:24.167
elite and whose masters were not abusive, had a relatively comfortable life.

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:29.147
Nonetheless, there were still an incredibly large amount of slaves who would

00:13:29.147 --> 00:13:35.607
suffer greatly and who had a particularly arduous, a particularly tough, fate.

00:13:36.907 --> 00:13:42.037
One such category was slaves who were put to work as manual labourers.

00:13:42.777 --> 00:13:47.307
Agricultural, or farming, slaves made up half of all Roman

00:13:47.307 --> 00:13:51.997
slaves and for these people, life was extremely harsh.

00:13:52.777 --> 00:13:55.637
They were often subject to horrific treatment from

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:59.527
their masters, being whipped, overworked, and starved.

00:14:00.717 --> 00:14:05.417
The Roman historian Cato wrote in his guide to slave ownership that

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:10.147
slaves should merely be given flour to make bread; however, if they

00:14:10.147 --> 00:14:14.077
were chained up, an owner should just give them the bread directly.

00:14:14.657 --> 00:14:18.457
He also advised that slaves be given minimal amounts of wine.

00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:25.177
Clearly, if you are required to work non-stop in the field, this is not an adequate diet.

00:14:26.287 --> 00:14:29.507
Even worse than the farms or the fields, though, were the

00:14:29.517 --> 00:14:33.567
mines and quarries, where slaves worked under the ground.

00:14:34.557 --> 00:14:40.987
Here, conditions were so bad that the life expectancy of a slave was just a few months.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:45.427
Down in the mines, workers spent hours underground in

00:14:45.437 --> 00:14:49.787
hot, dark, cramped tunnels which were incredibly unstable.

00:14:51.227 --> 00:14:55.467
As they dug for gold, copper or tin, the structures would

00:14:55.497 --> 00:14:59.657
often crack and collapse, crushing all who were inside.

00:15:01.027 --> 00:15:06.267
Working in such roles was such a dreaded job that the historian Diodorus of

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:11.507
Sicily recorded in the 1st century BC that many workers in the mines wished

00:15:11.527 --> 00:15:16.257
they would die sooner, rather than continue living in such extreme suffering.

00:15:17.757 --> 00:15:22.537
It would typically be men who were tasked with working in these types of heavy

00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:28.297
manual labour roles, so women normally avoided being crushed to death in the mines.

00:15:29.267 --> 00:15:33.267
But this, of course, does not mean that female slaves had it much better.

00:15:34.127 --> 00:15:39.847
A common activity that unskilled female slaves were forced to do was prostitution,

00:15:40.257 --> 00:15:44.867
requiring them to live in horrible conditions in filthy brothels in the city.

00:15:45.827 --> 00:15:51.457
Tragically, many women were forced into prostitution before they even reached puberty

00:15:51.767 --> 00:15:57.067
and they would suffer a lifetime of abuse as once a woman became a prostitute,

00:15:57.267 --> 00:16:02.627
she was a prostitute for life, with there usually being no way to leave the role.

00:16:03.537 --> 00:16:08.867
Women who were sex slaves as either prostitutes or concubines, who served

00:16:08.897 --> 00:16:13.737
only one rich man, were commonly raped, beaten and sometimes even killed.

00:16:15.117 --> 00:16:20.687
Understandably, whether forced to work in deadly conditions in a mine or subjected

00:16:20.687 --> 00:16:25.607
to life as a sex slave, there are plenty of reports of slaves trying to run away.

00:16:26.747 --> 00:16:29.817
But their punishment, if caught, was brutal.

00:16:30.697 --> 00:16:34.827
They would be hanged, or worse, crucified, nailed

00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:38.247
to a cross and left to die like Christ in the Bible.

00:16:39.737 --> 00:16:45.317
Some owners were so paranoid about their slaves leaving that to deter them

00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:50.367
from even attempting, they branded them on the forehead, tattoed them with

00:16:50.367 --> 00:16:55.007
a hot iron, so they would be instantly recognisable and easier to catch.

00:16:56.077 --> 00:17:00.307
And if a slave murdered their master, it was not only that

00:17:00.317 --> 00:17:04.907
individual who would face death but the entire household of slaves.

00:17:06.427 --> 00:17:12.017
Eventually, conditions for slaves got so bad that, despite the punishments they would

00:17:12.017 --> 00:17:16.687
face if they stood up to their masters, many decided that it was worth the risk.

00:17:17.727 --> 00:17:24.457
Beginning in 135 BC and continuing on and off until 71 BC,

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:28.257
there were a series of rebellions called the Servile Wars.

00:17:28.997 --> 00:17:33.927
The most famous of these was the third and final rebellion led by the

00:17:33.977 --> 00:17:39.277
infamous Spartacus, which you can learn more about in episode 193, by the way.

00:17:40.197 --> 00:17:45.337
And while these rebellions were massive events, with Spartacus thought to have

00:17:45.347 --> 00:17:50.987
united over 100,000 slaves, it’s perhaps surprising that there were not more

00:17:51.047 --> 00:17:55.817
uprisings, considering the massive numbers of slaves throughout Rome’s history.

00:17:56.817 --> 00:18:00.027
Indeed, it was certainly a known risk to the elite.

00:18:00.937 --> 00:18:06.097
A proposal had once been made to the senate that slaves wear different clothes to free

00:18:06.107 --> 00:18:12.867
citizens so they could be more easily identified, but this idea was rejected on the basis

00:18:12.867 --> 00:18:18.837
that if slaves realised how many others were slaves, they could be inspired to rebel.

00:18:20.147 --> 00:18:25.227
But despite this terrible treatment and the almost zero rights accorded to

00:18:25.227 --> 00:18:31.027
slaves, as Rome developed, the rights of slaves improved, albeit, slightly.

00:18:31.847 --> 00:18:38.017
In the fourth and fifth decades of the first century AD, emperor Claudius declared that a slave

00:18:38.037 --> 00:18:45.347
abandoned by his owner was then freed; after him, emperor Nero, who was not exactly known for

00:18:45.357 --> 00:18:50.657
being a kind-hearted man, allowed slaves to complain about their masters in a court of law.

00:18:51.787 --> 00:18:57.397
A century later, after the emperor Antonius Pius, it was declared that if an owner

00:18:57.457 --> 00:19:02.647
killed their slave without good reason, they would be charged with homicide, with murder.

00:19:03.967 --> 00:19:09.357
Apart from being abandoned by their owner, though, there were other ways that a small amount of

00:19:09.517 --> 00:19:16.867
lucky slaves, usually over the age of 30, were able to gain their freedom, and become a “freeman”.

00:19:18.267 --> 00:19:22.237
One way was for an owner to willingly free a slave.

00:19:23.017 --> 00:19:26.727
Cicero, for example, freed his secretary, who was a

00:19:26.727 --> 00:19:29.817
slave but had become a well-loved member of his family.

00:19:31.027 --> 00:19:34.827
The other way to become a freeman was by buying your freedom.

00:19:36.237 --> 00:19:40.757
Now, you may be wondering, how could a slave purchase freedom

00:19:40.757 --> 00:19:43.537
when they were not paid and were not allowed property.

00:19:44.007 --> 00:19:49.277
Well, some slaves were sort of paid, as they were given small portions of

00:19:49.277 --> 00:19:54.087
their owner’s money as if it were their own; this was called a peculium and

00:19:54.277 --> 00:19:59.487
over many years a slave could save this up and use it to buy their freedom.

00:20:00.677 --> 00:20:06.517
For enslaved women, a more common way to gain freedom was through marriage to their

00:20:06.557 --> 00:20:10.797
owner, which was typically done so that the owner could have legitimate children.

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:16.317
When slaves were freed, they were finally classed as citizens and could

00:20:16.367 --> 00:20:21.357
own property, enter marriages and even vote, if they were male, of course.

00:20:22.217 --> 00:20:28.527
Unfortunately, the only escape from slavery for the vast majority of slaves was death.

00:20:29.697 --> 00:20:35.627
And due to their status in Roman society and their lack of material possessions, little

00:20:35.657 --> 00:20:41.807
remains of Roman slaves to this day and most of what we do know of their life comes

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:46.657
from the writings of wealthy historians, who would have been slave-owners themselves.

00:20:47.607 --> 00:20:54.097
So, the life of a Roman slave was deeply unfair, often horrifically painful, sometimes

00:20:54.307 --> 00:21:00.207
tragically short, filled with misery, but for some, perhaps there were rare moments of hope.

00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:02.137
We will never really know.

00:21:03.057 --> 00:21:09.597
Ancient Rome was, clearly, a highly advanced and admirable civilisation in a plethora of ways.

00:21:10.257 --> 00:21:17.177
But much of it was made possible by its most barbarous and vile element, slavery, which,

00:21:17.447 --> 00:21:23.767
for all of the amazing innovations to come out of Rome, will forever be its darkest stain.

00:21:26.778 --> 00:21:31.948
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on Slaves in Ancient Rome.

00:21:32.288 --> 00:21:37.908
The title of this episode was “a job from hell”, and I think you would still be hard

00:21:37.928 --> 00:21:42.948
pressed to find a less pleasant way to spend your life than as a slave in ancient Rome.

00:21:43.698 --> 00:21:48.238
As a reminder, this was part two of a three-part mini-series on ancient Rome.

00:21:48.688 --> 00:21:52.378
Part one was on the politics of ancient Rome, and next up it’ll

00:21:52.388 --> 00:21:56.438
be the bloody lives of another unfortunate group, gladiators.

00:21:57.368 --> 00:22:01.828

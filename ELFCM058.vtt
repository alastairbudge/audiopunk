The show where you can learn fascinating things about the world

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:19.537
and listen to interesting stories while improving your English.

00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:25.845
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about plastic.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.843
It is one of the most important inventions of the past 200

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:36.241
years and has revolutionised food, medicine, transport,

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:39.588
and is used for almost everything we do.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:45.338
But as we all know, it is also causing big problems.

00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:51.907
Filling up oceans, killing animals, and fish, and maybe even killing us.

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:58.147
In today's episode, we will be talking about where plastic comes from,

00:00:58.577 --> 00:01:04.397
why it was so revolutionary, why so much of it ends up in the

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:11.057
oceans, and what the future might hold for us and for our children and grandchildren.

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:14.027
It's going to be quite an interesting one.

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:18.217
Before we get started though, If you are listening

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:22.057

community of curious minds from all over the world, then the link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:14.135
Okay then, let's talk about plastic.

00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:20.455
Plastic is in many ways a fantastic invention.

00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:26.545
Plastic bottles provide clean drinking water to hundreds of millions of

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:31.275
people all over the world who wouldn't otherwise have access to clean water.

00:02:32.058 --> 00:02:34.848
Plastic allows fresh food to last for

00:02:34.848 --> 00:02:39.168
longer, so there is at least the opportunity for less waste.

00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:47.088
Plastic makes cars and aeroplanes lighter, so we use less fuel and pollute less.

00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:52.758
It has revolutionised medicine allowing for countless millions

00:02:52.758 --> 00:02:56.298
of lives to be saved that would otherwise not have been.

00:02:57.382 --> 00:03:02.152
And when it was first invented, it even saved animals.

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:09.742
Now this might sound like a strange thing to hear nowadays when all we

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:15.832
hear about is fish getting trapped in plastic bags, but when plastic

00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:23.332
was invented, it was actually partly created as a way to save animals.

00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:25.552
It's quite a cool story.

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:35.742
So in the mid 19th century, things like piano keys, combs for your hair and billiard balls,

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:42.952
pool balls, they were all often made out of ivory from elephants' tusks.

00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:46.193
Obviously that wasn't sustainable.

00:03:46.673 --> 00:03:50.993
Thousands of elephants were being killed every year, just so

00:03:50.993 --> 00:03:55.823
people could play the piano, play billiards, or comb their hair.

00:03:57.143 --> 00:04:02.273
And of course, it meant that all of these things were very expensive because

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:09.443
ivory was scarce, there wasn't much of it, so the raw materials were expensive.

00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:15.506
So a billiards company in New York city had an idea.

00:04:16.586 --> 00:04:24.596
They offered a $10,000 prize, which would be about $350,000 in today's money,

00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:29.971
they offered this prize for anyone who could invent an alternative.

00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:36.071
They were, of course, not just doing this out of the goodness of their

00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:42.281
own heart if they could make billiard balls cheaper than they could sell more of them.

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:49.028
And a man called John Wesley Hyatt, who was an amateur inventor,

00:04:49.478 --> 00:04:55.118
not even a professional chemist, he decided that he wanted to give it a try.

00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:02.148
After years of trial and error, he invented something that

00:05:02.148 --> 00:05:07.278
he called 'celluloid', which was the first type of plastic.

00:05:08.598 --> 00:05:14.893
It was actually made out of cellulose, which is the polymer found in plants.

00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:21.543
So, strangely enough, the first plastic was actually plant-based.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:26.002
However, it wasn't until the mid 20th century

00:05:26.272 --> 00:05:31.252
that plastic would actually start to really rise in popularity.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:37.382
Cheap hydrocarbons, cheap petrol, had meant that the process

00:05:37.382 --> 00:05:42.191
to make plastic had become a lot cheaper and quicker, and the

00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:48.641
economic boom of the post-war years meant that, especially in the United States

00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:53.925
and Europe, consumers were ready for a world filled with plastic.

00:05:55.315 --> 00:06:00.385
People had more money and the price for lots of goods had decreased.

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:07.579
Of course, this meant a big jump in consumption, a big jump in people buying stuff.

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:19.419
This new revolutionary plastic was often advertised as to be thrown away as soon as it was used.

00:06:20.494 --> 00:06:27.484
There was a famous front cover of Life magazine in the US in 1955 with

00:06:27.484 --> 00:06:34.207
the headline Throw away living' and a photo of a happy family just

00:06:34.307 --> 00:06:41.927
throwing plastic plates, cups, knives, and spoons, throwing them up in the air.

00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:47.052
Instead of doing the washing up and cleaning, Americans

00:06:47.052 --> 00:06:52.212
could now just use things once, then throw them away, never to have

00:06:52.212 --> 00:06:59.322
to worry about cleaning up because it was so cheap just to buy more.

00:07:00.822 --> 00:07:08.022
Well, as we all know, 65 years after that magazine cover, it wasn't quite so simple.

00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:13.782
You can throw away as much plastic as you like, but there

00:07:13.782 --> 00:07:19.182
are consequences and those consequences are quite serious.

00:07:19.883 --> 00:07:26.214
The qualities that make plastic so fantastic that it is versatile and hard,

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:33.849
these are exactly the same things that make it so hard to get rid of, so difficult to dispose of.

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:37.589
The estimates about how long plastic

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:45.059
takes to biodegrade range from 450 years to never.

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:53.746
If Christopher Columbus in 1492, if he had been drinking bottled water on his way

00:07:53.746 --> 00:07:59.661
to the Americas and had thrown a plastic bottle over the side of the ship, into the

00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:05.286
sea, there is a chance that it would still be around today in some shape or form.

00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:09.321
And those disposable nappies that

00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.681
most babies around the world are currently wearing?

00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:18.234
When they are thrown away, when your little child needs a new nappy, Alastair Budge:

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:23.829
that same nappy will probably still exist in the world in the 25th century.

00:08:25.014 --> 00:08:29.223
I know it's easy to just throw out statistics, but here

00:08:29.223 --> 00:08:33.963
are a few numbers just to remind you of what we are all dealing with.

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:45.123
Since 1950, 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been produced, and of that 6.4

00:08:45.183 --> 00:08:49.594
billion is no longer in use, it's now considered useless.

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:55.164
So where is this 6.4 billion tonnes of plastic then?

00:08:55.884 --> 00:09:01.946
Well, of the 6.4 billion, 79% is either in

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:06.296
rubbish dumps or sitting somewhere in the natural world.

00:09:07.316 --> 00:09:13.586
12% has been burned and only 9% has been recycled.

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:18.956
And we are producing more and more plastic every year.

00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:24.034
Each year we produce 300 million tonnes of plastic,

00:09:24.424 --> 00:09:30.094
which is about 38 kilos of plastic per person, every single year.

00:09:31.984 --> 00:09:38.824
Around the world 1 million plastic drinking bottles are purchased every single

00:09:38.824 --> 00:09:42.364
minute, so by the time you've finished listening to this

00:09:42.364 --> 00:09:47.404
podcast, about 20 million plastic bottles will have been bought.

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.780
And all of this plastic that is produced, Alastair Budge:

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:57.450
half of it is designed to be used only once and then thrown away.

00:09:58.665 --> 00:10:02.300
But, you might ask, what actually is the problem with this?

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:06.920
Is it just because there is plastic flowing into the oceans?

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.740
It's polluting the rivers and beaches and killing some dolphins and tuna?

00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:19.832
The reality is that it is doing all of that, but there is a lot about what happens

00:10:19.832 --> 00:10:25.745
to plastics when they get into the oceans that we don't properly understand yet.

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:30.429
We know that plastics do break up into smaller

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:36.009
and smaller pieces becoming microplastics and then nanoplastics

00:10:36.549 --> 00:10:43.254
and they are consumed by fish and perhaps eventually, even humans.

00:10:43.997 --> 00:10:46.473
What we do know is that we Alastair Budge:

00:10:46.473 --> 00:10:50.643
are ingesting a lot of microplastics without knowing it.

00:10:52.083 --> 00:11:00.843
A study suggested that Americans eat or breathe in at least 74,000 microplastic

00:11:00.873 --> 00:11:07.979
particles every year, and another study suggested that this adds up to

00:11:07.979 --> 00:11:14.969
five grammes of plastic every single week, which is about the weight of a credit card.

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:21.209
What we don't really know though is what this means.

00:11:22.189 --> 00:11:25.489
We're pretty sure that it's not going to be good for us

00:11:25.849 --> 00:11:32.209
as plastics are formed of some harmful chemicals, but there haven't been

00:11:32.209 --> 00:11:37.169
any authoritative studies on what the long term impact of this will be.

00:11:38.574 --> 00:11:42.925
So we know that we produce a lot of plastic, that it lasts

00:11:42.955 --> 00:11:50.095
for a long time, that hardly any of it is currently recycled, and that having

00:11:50.095 --> 00:11:56.185
plastic floating around the oceans is generally a bad idea for multiple reasons.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:11:59.605
But what can we actually do about it?

00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:06.575
Well, some people might say that we just need to get better at recycling.

00:12:07.415 --> 00:12:12.155
If we can recycle everything, then we can continue our love affair

00:12:12.215 --> 00:12:18.755
with plastic and benefit from its convenience while not blocking up our oceans with it.

00:12:20.535 --> 00:12:27.800
Unfortunately though, new plastic is so cheap to make that it just doesn't really

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:34.010
make much economic sense for companies to recycle right now, especially in the

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:40.070
developing world where plastic is so ubiquitous, partly because of how cheap it is.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:46.217
And a lot of plastic waste is actually just difficult to recycle.

00:12:46.997 --> 00:12:52.307
The little packets of shampoo that are sold in places like Indonesia

00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:57.302
and the Philippines and then thrown away after being used, it would

00:12:57.302 --> 00:13:01.292
make no sense to recycle them and it would be very difficult to do so.

00:13:03.152 --> 00:13:10.712
And even things like plastic bottles, the cost of collecting them, taking them to the recycling

00:13:10.712 --> 00:13:18.692
centre and then recycling them is in many cases quite a lot higher than just making a new bottle.

00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:24.722
This is not to say that recycling is bad, of course, but just to point out that

00:13:24.722 --> 00:13:30.542
there are some pretty significant issues with thinking that recycling is the complete solution.

00:13:32.642 --> 00:13:37.352
There is of course an element of behaviour change that can help,

00:13:37.952 --> 00:13:42.962
partly driven by us consumers and partly driven by governments.

00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:50.697
Things like banning the use of plastic bags, which has been done by several African countries,

00:13:50.967 --> 00:13:58.437
to consumer action campaigns to refuse single use plastics, like plastic straws for drinks.

00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:06.611
However, these campaigns are normally a bit of a luxury and tend to happen

00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:13.121
in more developed, wealthier countries, mainly in Europe and North America.

00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:18.801
And even though we still have a plastic problem in these

00:14:18.801 --> 00:14:25.281
countries, it is dwarfed by the plastic problem in several Asian countries.

00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:35.591
In fact, about half of all the world's plastic waste that ends up in the oceans comes from just five

00:14:35.711 --> 00:14:41.963
countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.

00:14:43.643 --> 00:14:50.843
So even if in Europe and North America, we were able to recycle a hundred percent

00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:58.313
of our plastic waste, it would only have a small impact on plastic waste globally.

00:15:00.055 --> 00:15:05.155
Of course, refusing a plastic straw at a bar or restaurant is a good thing

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:12.445
if you don't need it, but it has an absolutely tiny impact on the global plastic problem.

00:15:13.532 --> 00:15:17.307
There are, as you may have read about, some initiatives

00:15:17.427 --> 00:15:21.597
that are quite encouraging in terms of moving away from plastic.

00:15:22.797 --> 00:15:29.607
Carlsberg and Coca-Cola in the Netherlands are trialing plant-based bottles that

00:15:29.607 --> 00:15:36.177
will degrade within one year, which will mean that consumers can still benefit

00:15:36.447 --> 00:15:41.787
from the convenience of plastic without the long term environmental impact.

00:15:43.237 --> 00:15:49.537
And in terms of consumer behaviour, there is a lot more awareness of the impact

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:56.617
of single use plastic on the environment, and people are making more informed choices and

00:15:56.617 --> 00:16:03.097
businesses are responding to that with trying to provide more socially responsible products.

00:16:03.937 --> 00:16:09.247
Coca-Cola, for example, has pledged that it will collect and recycle the

00:16:09.247 --> 00:16:15.157
equivalent of all of its plastic packaging, which is 128 billion bottles a

00:16:15.157 --> 00:16:20.017
year, and it has pledged that it will do that by the year 2030.

00:16:22.057 --> 00:16:24.997
So that is, of course, a positive development.

00:16:26.257 --> 00:16:31.537
But there is one pretty interesting idea that has been proposed as a solution.

00:16:32.422 --> 00:16:38.572
And you may think that it would be some revolutionary new technology or a completely

00:16:38.572 --> 00:16:42.933
new type of plastic, but it's actually a lot simpler than that.

00:16:43.443 --> 00:16:49.653
It's not sexy, not revolutionary, and you might think, well, it's just obvious.

00:16:50.643 --> 00:16:58.113
It's for there to be some sort of global tax on plastic that will go directly back into

00:16:58.113 --> 00:17:04.113
rubbish collection services in the countries where most of the plastic pollution happens.

00:17:05.239 --> 00:17:09.529
The problem with lots of the countries that are most responsible for

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:15.082
the world's plastic pollution is just that they have very bad rubbish

00:17:15.112 --> 00:17:22.222
collection and so most rubbish, of which plastic is the main part, is just thrown

00:17:22.522 --> 00:17:27.681
ultimately into rivers from where it makes its way into the oceans.

00:17:28.986 --> 00:17:34.956
Indeed, 90% of all of the plastic in the world's oceans comes

00:17:34.956 --> 00:17:41.106
from just 10 rivers, 8 of which are in Asia and two are in Africa.

00:17:42.426 --> 00:17:46.866
If there were better rubbish collection in these countries, if

00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:52.716
rubbish was actually collected regularly and disposed of safely,

00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:56.886
then that would stop it getting into the oceans in the first place.

00:17:58.236 --> 00:18:03.583
Yes, it wouldn't solve the problem of the plastic that's already in the oceans Alastair Budge:

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:08.996
and it wouldn't solve our addiction to cheap plastic, but it would mean

00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:13.836
that it was safely disposed of and we could stop the flood of plastic

00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:19.266
going into the oceans every year, 8 million tonnes at the last estimate.

00:18:20.525 --> 00:18:23.708
The solution, or at least a solution,

00:18:24.098 --> 00:18:27.488
is sometimes a lot more obvious than you might think.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:34.846
Okay then, I hope that this has been an interesting look into the world of plastic.

00:18:35.716 --> 00:18:40.126
It is a product that has made our lives infinitely more

00:18:40.126 --> 00:18:44.476
convenient, but that convenience comes with a price.

00:18:45.846 --> 00:18:49.206
While we don't fully understand what that price is,

00:18:49.686 --> 00:18:52.956
we're pretty sure it's one that's not worth paying.

00:18:54.406 --> 00:18:58.096

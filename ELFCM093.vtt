Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.280
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.040
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.760
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The Opium Wars, the conflict

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.170
mainly between China and Britain in the mid-19th century that all started because of drugs.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.870
It’s an amazing story, not many people in Britain, or in Europe for

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.550
that matter, know much about it, but it is incredibly important when it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.530
comes to understanding China, the Chinese mentality, and China today.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.020
So, without further ado, let’s get started.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.130
Let’s wind the clocks back 200 years or so, to the start of the 19th century.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.830
It’s almost the height of the British empire.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.940
India is under British control, trade is flourishing, or rather, British merchants are

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.150
getting incredibly rich through exploiting the natural resources of British colonies, and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.560
purely from a ‘world standing’ point of view, there aren’t many better times to be a Brit.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.370
China, although it may not have had colonial ambitions, is still the world’s biggest

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.890
country by a long way, and in 1800 about 1 in 3 people on the planet were Chinese,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.660
or rather, fell under the authority of the Qing emperor, the Chinese emperor.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.030
Partly because it was such a large, varied country, and partly for cultural reasons,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.460
China didn’t trade with the rest of the world in the same way that Britain did.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.500
Britain was, and I should say, still is, a small, quite

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.310
crowded, island without an abundance of natural resources.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.320
It did need to trade, and grew fabulously wealthy through trade enabled by its colonies.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.390
And people in Britain, the middle and upper classes in Britain at least, had

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.260
started to develop quite a taste for several goods that China had in abundance.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.040
Specifically, silk, tea, and porcelain, or china with a small C.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.565
At the end of the 18th century, British merchants were buying an increasing amount

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.870
of goods from China, but the Chinese weren’t buying anything from the British.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.810
This caused a big trade imbalance, so there was a lot of silver flowing out

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.910
of Britain to China, and only tea, silk and porcelain flowing back to Britain.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.690
Now, a trade imbalance per se isn’t a terrible thing, but it looked like

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.940
this addiction to Chinese goods was draining the British supplies of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.180
silver, it was running out of silver because it was all being sent to China.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.740
So the British needed to find some way of getting the Chinese to buy something of theirs.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.550
One logistical problem with this was that there technically weren’t diplomatic relations

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.190
between the Qing emperor and the British empire, so there was no basis on which to trade.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.810
The Qing emperor was used to a tribute system, where people would come to him bringing

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.540
tribute, bringing gifts, and acknowledging the fact that the emperor was the superior player.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.270
This wasn’t a relationship of equals.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.190
The British had tried to take part in this system, and in 1793 they had sent a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.580
diplomat called Lord George Macartney to try to build relations with the Qing emperor.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.500
Unfortunately he failed miserably, and the emperor

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.190
wrote a letter back to the King of England saying:

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.010
“Our celestial empire possesses all things in prolific

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.550
abundance and lacks no product within its borders.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.760
There is, therefore, no need to import the manufactures

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.460
of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce."

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.270
So, there you go, quite a put-down, right?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.930
The Chinese didn’t want to buy anything that the British were selling,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.980
everything they needed existed in abundance inside China, so it

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.260
looked like the British were going to need to try something else.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.550
And you can probably guess what that something else was, given the title of this episode.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.940
Opium.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.790
The drug that can be extracted from poppies.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.550
In the early 1800s, the British East India company

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.090
started exporting opium from Bengal, in India, to China.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.360
This wasn’t the first time that opium had been brought to China, but

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.700
the quantities in which it was imported were like nothing before.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.880
Sure enough, the trade imbalance swung the other way, and instead of it being

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.030
Britain that was sending silver to China, it was Chinese silver that was flowing

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.990
back to Britain in order to pay for all of the opium that its people were smoking.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.000
The Chinese knew the problems that opium could cause, and it had been banned in China since 1729.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.490
However, although China did have one of the world’s oldest and largest bureaucratic

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.790
systems, it often didn’t work very well, especially the further away you got from Beijing.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.790
There’s a Chinese saying that goes Tiān gāo, huángdì yuǎn, which is

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.860
typically translated as "Heaven is high and the emperor is far away".

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:07.380
The only open port to foreigners was Canton, modern day Guangzhou, right to the south of China,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.250
in the Pearl River Delta, close to Hong Kong, and thousands of kilometres away from Beijing.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:21.060
The British would smuggle the opium into Canton, and even though opium was technically

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:27.310
illegal, the profits to be made were too hard to ignore for local merchants and bureaucrats.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.630
The south of China was flooded with opium, and it’s estimated that around ten

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.260
million people were using the drug, of whom around 2 million were addicts.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:47.490
The sheer numbers certainly suggest that the demand was there: from the year 1810 to

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:55.290
1839 the amount of opium imported to China jumped from 10,000 chests, which is about

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:02.340
600 tonnes to 40,000, so almost two and a half thousand tonnes of opium every year.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:09.050
The emperor wasn’t initially sure what should be done to combat this, and you can probably

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.630
recognise the thought process that countries and governments are still going through today.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:20.750
Should he punish the dealers, the people selling the drugs or the users, the people using the drugs?

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.180
What was the most effective way to get rid of this drug that was causing huge problems

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.500
in large parts of Chinese society, turning bureaucrats and soldiers into drug addicts?

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.770
In the end, he decided to punish the dealers.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.700
He sent a capable and ambitious government official,

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.000
a man named Lin Zexu to Canton, to the south of China.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.910
Lin Zexu was not good news for the British opium dealers.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.170
He ordered the British opium merchants to hand over to him

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.691
their supplies of opium,  so that he could destroy them.

00:07:58.697 --> 00:08:05.287
After some tense weeks of negotiations, and assurances from a top British diplomat that

00:08:05.287 --> 00:08:10.987
the British merchants would be compensated for their opium by the British government, the

00:08:10.997 --> 00:08:16.687
merchants handed it over to Lin, and it was then destroyed, it was burnt by the Chinese.

00:08:17.587 --> 00:08:20.637
This was a big problem for the British government.

00:08:21.197 --> 00:08:25.737
The official who had promised the traders that they would be compensated didn’t

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:30.637
really have the authority to do it, and now the government was on the hook

00:08:30.837 --> 00:08:35.557
for today’s equivalent of tens of millions of pounds, for drugs, remember.

00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.537
Plus, it was a huge insult to Britain.

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:43.267
It wasn’t used to being pushed around and told what to do.

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:46.527
Normally it was Britain that pushed other people around.

00:08:47.747 --> 00:08:51.127
So Britain responded in its tried and tested way.

00:08:51.617 --> 00:08:52.227
Force.

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:59.677
In early 1840 it sent a force up the Pearl River, towards Canton, towards Guangzhou.

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:05.217
The Chinese forces were no match for the British, who had faster

00:09:05.247 --> 00:09:09.827
boats with more powerful weapons, and they were swiftly defeated.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.677
But the British didn’t stop at Canton.

00:09:14.317 --> 00:09:18.357
Subsequent campaigns went further north, using the Chinese canal

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:23.217
network, and they even captured Nanjing, the southern capital of China.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:30.687
By 1842 the campaign was over, and Britain decided it was payback time, it wanted

00:09:30.717 --> 00:09:36.437
compensation for the lost opium, it wanted compensation for the cost of the war,

00:09:36.717 --> 00:09:42.497
and while it was at it, it wanted to get as much out of China as it possibly could.

00:09:43.627 --> 00:09:50.257
And China wasn’t really in any position to argue with the British demands, and a treaty was formed.

00:09:51.277 --> 00:09:57.757
This gave Britain the deep-water port at Hong Kong, a big compensation payout, five

00:09:57.767 --> 00:10:04.067
new ports that it could use to trade, something called extraterritoriality, so that

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:10.107
British expats in these ports would be under British, not Chinese law, and finally,

00:10:10.137 --> 00:10:15.757
a ‘most favoured nation’ clause, which meant that if China did any further deals

00:10:15.817 --> 00:10:21.137
with any other countries, these rights would automatically apply to Britain as well.

00:10:22.077 --> 00:10:24.007
And what did China get in return?

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:25.227
Nothing.

00:10:26.027 --> 00:10:31.257
The only thing that they didn’t concede to Britain was that opium still wasn’t legalised.

00:10:32.257 --> 00:10:36.747
This was the first of what has come to be known as the ‘unequal treaties’.

00:10:37.177 --> 00:10:38.377
You can see where the name comes from.

00:10:39.657 --> 00:10:44.117
Britain got a foothold into China, and continued to flood the country

00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:48.307
with increasing amounts of opium, even though it was still illegal.

00:10:49.457 --> 00:10:54.647
But given the British presence in the ports, and the fact that they had seen what the

00:10:54.657 --> 00:10:59.927
British were capable of, there wasn’t a huge amount that the Chinese could do to stop them.

00:11:01.007 --> 00:11:03.447
It wasn’t to be the end of the fighting through.

00:11:04.267 --> 00:11:12.637
Just 15 years later, in October 1856, the Chinese arrested the crew of a British ship, and

00:11:12.727 --> 00:11:19.117
Britain saw this as an excuse to put more pressure on China to open up to British trade.

00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:25.387
British forces attacked Canton, but this time they were joined by the French,

00:11:25.677 --> 00:11:30.887
who had used the execution of a French Christian missionary as an excuse to join

00:11:30.887 --> 00:11:36.597
the campaign and see what concessions they could also extract from the Chinese.

00:11:37.677 --> 00:11:42.187
The French and the British fought a series of battles against the Chinese for

00:11:42.187 --> 00:11:47.887
the next 4 years, culminating in the burning of the emperor’s summer palace

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:53.547
just outside Beijing, which was ordered by a British diplomat called Lord Elgin.

00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:58.897
Now, on the subject of British diplomats called Elgin, if you recognise the

00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:03.897
name and are thinking about the Elgin marbles, the marble statues from the

00:12:03.907 --> 00:12:08.657
Parthenon, these were actually bought by his father, another Lord Elgin.

00:12:09.277 --> 00:12:13.287
So one is responsible for taking the marbles away from Greece, the

00:12:13.287 --> 00:12:16.647
other is responsible for the burning of a beautiful summer palace.

00:12:17.177 --> 00:12:19.507
This family’s record isn’t looking too great, is it?

00:12:20.397 --> 00:12:21.997
OK then, I digress.

00:12:22.897 --> 00:12:29.867
On the 18th of October 1860, the Treaty of Beijing was signed and the second Opium War was over.

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:37.297
This handed over even more rights to the British and the French, including giving the British

00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:43.477
Kowloon, the part opposite Hong Kong island, as well as official legalisation of the opium trade

00:12:43.697 --> 00:12:48.807
and the right for Christian missionaries to have the same rights as ordinary Chinese citizens.

00:12:49.757 --> 00:12:55.777
So, that’s what happened, but where it really gets interesting is what this actually means.

00:12:56.847 --> 00:13:02.717
Firstly, the story of the Opium Wars is something that isn’t well known at all in the UK.

00:13:03.147 --> 00:13:06.677
It’s not taught in history classes, it’s not something that’s

00:13:06.677 --> 00:13:10.337
in popular culture, people just don’t really know about it.

00:13:11.147 --> 00:13:13.607
In China, everyone knows about it.

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:18.627
Children are taught about it in school, it’s often referenced by

00:13:18.627 --> 00:13:22.677
government officials, and it has most certainly not been forgotten.

00:13:23.827 --> 00:13:30.117
You might think that this is strange - normally the victors in any battle or war are

00:13:30.117 --> 00:13:36.087
the ones more likely to continue to talk about it, not the party that came off worse.

00:13:37.217 --> 00:13:44.977
For China, the point is to never forget this humiliation, never forget how a once great country

00:13:44.977 --> 00:13:51.037
was forced to give in to these unequal demands, and forced to do something against its will.

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:56.087
This was the first time that China had been conquered, it

00:13:56.087 --> 00:14:00.697
was the end of ancient China, and it was hugely embarrassing.

00:14:01.627 --> 00:14:05.587
All Chinese should know about this so that it can never happen again.

00:14:06.687 --> 00:14:12.102
There’s a saying that Chinese students still learn today about the Opium Wars, and that’s Luòhòu

00:14:12.247 --> 00:14:19.527
jiù yào āidǎ - literally it means something like “if you fall behind, you will be beaten”.

00:14:20.087 --> 00:14:25.128
In the case of the opium Wars, China did fall behind, and it was beaten.

00:14:26.038 --> 00:14:32.008
The British were superior militarily, and that was in a large part

00:14:32.148 --> 00:14:36.218
because the country had got rich through empire, and through trade.

00:14:37.448 --> 00:14:42.028
China was closed off, closed to outsiders, and hadn’t

00:14:42.028 --> 00:14:45.218
modernised in the same way as European powers had.

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:50.408
It’s estimated that the Chinese military was about 200 years

00:14:50.448 --> 00:14:54.778
behind the British, which explains why it was defeated so quickly.

00:14:55.718 --> 00:14:57.378
That must never happen again.

00:14:58.378 --> 00:15:03.518
The impact that these unequal treaties had on China was huge, and

00:15:03.518 --> 00:15:08.418
the first Opium War was the start of what China called its century of

00:15:08.418 --> 00:15:13.568
humiliation, before the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.

00:15:14.498 --> 00:15:19.918
Arguably the fact that China was so weakened after these treaties led it to be

00:15:19.922 --> 00:15:25.822
such a fertile ground for the ideas of two foreigners, a German and a Russian,

00:15:26.122 --> 00:15:31.472
Engels and Lenin, and ultimately the fact that China became a communist power.

00:15:32.722 --> 00:15:40.042
It certainly wasn’t destined to be, as up to 1912 it had had a monarchy since prehistoric times.

00:15:41.222 --> 00:15:45.772
In a strange twist of fate, while it may have been the Westerners who were

00:15:45.772 --> 00:15:50.972
the terrible drug producers, flooding the streets of China with cheap opium

00:15:51.212 --> 00:15:57.302
back in the 19th century, in 2020 at least, the tables have somewhat turned.

00:15:58.462 --> 00:16:04.452
The opioid epidemic is causing havoc on the streets of the United States, and the majority

00:16:04.452 --> 00:16:10.772
of the fentanyl, the synthetic opioid, that arrives in the US, it comes from China.

00:16:11.712 --> 00:16:17.132
Although it would be easy to draw parallels with The Opium Wars, and it’s certainly an

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:23.192
easy headline, it’s not a full, state-sponsored war in order to push drugs on a population.

00:16:24.642 --> 00:16:30.912
And this, for me, is one of the strangest things about the Opium War, that it was a full,

00:16:31.102 --> 00:16:36.882
state-sponsored drug war, really, fought to protect the rights of British drug dealers.

00:16:37.872 --> 00:16:42.262
There is some debate about whether the war was fought really just for

00:16:42.262 --> 00:16:47.202
opium, or rather it was for trade in general, but whatever the reason

00:16:47.282 --> 00:16:53.125
actually was, opium, a drug, was the ingredient that sparked it all off.

00:16:53.622 --> 00:16:58.352
And when you now think that there is a war on drugs, a war on the drug

00:16:58.352 --> 00:17:03.832
producers, it’s strange to think that not too long ago one of the most powerful

00:17:03.852 --> 00:17:08.802
countries in the world went to war when another country took its drugs away.

00:17:11.242 --> 00:17:15.472
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on The Opium Wars.

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:19.382
If you’re Chinese, you probably know all about this already, but

00:17:19.422 --> 00:17:22.792
if you’re not Chinese, well I hope you’ve learned something new.

00:17:23.862 --> 00:17:27.392
As always, I’d love to know what you thought of the episode.

00:17:27.682 --> 00:17:33.042
The place to go for that now is our lovely new community, which is community.leonardoenglish.com.

00:17:33.532 --> 00:17:38.702
There’s a section on that called ‘Podcasts’, so head on in and ask any questions you might have.

00:17:39.072 --> 00:17:39.802
I’ll be there.

00:17:41.372 --> 00:17:45.902

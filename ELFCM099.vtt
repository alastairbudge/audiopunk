Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:16.046
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:20.406
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:27.546
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about money laundering, the

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:33.516
process that criminals go through to take illegal money and make it look like it’s legal.

00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:38.733
Just in case we need a disclaimer here, I should of course say that neither

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:43.033
I nor Leonardo English endorses any of the activity that we’re going to

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:47.963
describe here because, well, it's illegal and deeply damaging to society.

00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:53.843
But just because it’s criminal, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to understand

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:59.323
it, and indeed the dirty world of money laundering is pretty fascinating.

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:03.333
So without further ado, let’s get started.

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:09.833
I guess you’ve heard of money laundering, you’ve seen it in movies, you’ve read

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:15.383
about cases of big banks getting hit with huge fines, but you might not know

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:20.433
how it really works, and how vital it is to how the criminal underworld works.

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:26.253
Indeed, without money laundering, the incentives to commit crime would be greatly

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:32.613
reduced, and the fact that money can relatively easily be washed through the financial

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:38.883
system and actually used by criminals is a large incentive for people to commit crime.

00:01:39.713 --> 00:01:43.323
If you couldn’t actually use the money you had made through

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:46.263
crime, would you want to commit the crime in the first place?

00:01:46.863 --> 00:01:47.273
Probably not.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:54.523
For anyone, not just modern-day criminals, hiding the origins of money is nothing new.

00:01:55.713 --> 00:01:58.673
Pirates would try to hide the origins of their treasure.

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:04.323
Chinese merchants thousands of years ago would hide money through different

00:02:04.353 --> 00:02:08.853
companies in order to avoid the government seeing it, in order to avoid tax.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:14.793
But the term ‘money laundering’, and the concept is

00:02:14.983 --> 00:02:19.483
normally thought to have originated in the US in the 1920s.

00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:27.023
Al Capone, the famous gangster, used a series of laundromats, shops with washing machines,

00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:33.463
to launder the proceeds of his criminal activities, to make his money seem legal.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.463
Back then, the idea was quite simple.

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:44.533
Al Capone’s gang would make its real money through criminal means: illegal distribution of

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:50.663
alcohol, gambling, prostitution, extortion, all sorts of things that were illegal at the time.

00:02:51.543 --> 00:02:54.293
These activities generated a lot of cash.

00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:55.213
They made a lot of money.

00:02:56.183 --> 00:03:00.443
Al Capone couldn’t just go to the bank with this cash, because even

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:04.203
back then, a bank might ask where all this money had come from.

00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:13.113
So, Capone owned a series of laundromats, which would report much higher sales than they really had.

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:19.533
Essentially if they did $500 in ‘real’ sales that day, they would add

00:03:19.543 --> 00:03:24.103
another $500 to their accounts, so it looked like they had done $1000.

00:03:25.303 --> 00:03:30.323
Every day dirty money would be recorded by the laundromat as a sale, and

00:03:30.353 --> 00:03:34.433
by doing this every day, at the end of the month that laundromat would

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:39.333
record a bumper profit, and it could be paid out to Capone and his gang.

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:45.971
If the authorities asked him to show where his money came from, he could say that he was the owner

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:51.851
of a profitable chain of laundromats, and as the legal owner he was allowed to take the profits.

00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:58.691
Indeed, when Capone was finally caught, he wasn’t sent to prison for any of

00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:04.361
his hundreds of gangster crimes - financing murder, extortion and prostitution.

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:07.321
He was sent to prison for tax evasion.

00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:13.341
So the term ‘laundering’ is thought to have come from Al Capone, the

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:17.881
first celebrity gangster to have taken dirty money and made it clean.

00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:24.867
This was almost 100 years ago now, and while how money laundering works has evolved

00:04:25.027 --> 00:04:29.547
and become more sophisticated, the general principle remains pretty similar.

00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:35.087
Criminal activity generates money, criminals make money from crime, and

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:39.707
they need a way to take that money and be able to use it to buy stuff.

00:04:40.687 --> 00:04:43.977
Now, for small amounts, this isn’t such a problem.

00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:51.577
Paying for something with $20, $50, or $100 in cash isn’t going to arouse

00:04:51.807 --> 00:04:57.837
much suspicion, people aren’t going to get suspicious if you pay $100 in cash.

00:04:58.517 --> 00:05:04.517
But when criminals start making more and more money, many fall into the trap of wanting to live

00:05:04.527 --> 00:05:10.677
an ever more luxurious lifestyle, and needing larger amounts of money to make bigger purchases.

00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:16.827
That car, that boat, that house, you need to be able to say where you

00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:21.187
got the money to pay for it, and that’s where money laundering comes in.

00:05:21.847 --> 00:05:27.757
It’s the process of taking dirty, criminal money and turning it into beautiful, clean,

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:33.097
fresh currency that looks as if it has been earned through completely legal means.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:40.567
There are three steps to this: placement, layering, and integration.

00:05:41.663 --> 00:05:45.153
Placement is putting this money into the financial system.

00:05:46.253 --> 00:05:49.903
Now, before this step the criminal money probably

00:05:49.903 --> 00:05:53.453
doesn’t exist anywhere in the legal financial system.

00:05:54.473 --> 00:06:00.393
If it’s cash, from drugs, prostitution, weapons sales, or whatever criminal

00:06:00.393 --> 00:06:05.333
activity it might be, this money exists outside the financial system.

00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:09.263
Maybe it’s in suitcases in your wardrobe, maybe it’s

00:06:09.393 --> 00:06:13.123
hidden in barrels in the ground, it’s outside the system.

00:06:13.543 --> 00:06:15.963
You need to get it into the financial system.

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:19.063
This can be done in different ways.

00:06:19.173 --> 00:06:25.643
Maybe it’s like Al Capone, and it’s a case of putting it into a business like a laundromat.

00:06:26.773 --> 00:06:30.093
The preferred types of businesses for money launderers

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:33.523
are ones that use cash, and service-based ones.

00:06:34.283 --> 00:06:40.193
Strip clubs, laundromats of course, hairdressers, and any business where it’s easy

00:06:40.193 --> 00:06:45.583
to just add some more money to it every day without too many questions being asked.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.400
And almost the ultimate business to use for this ‘placement’ stage is one where

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.890
you can immediately swap your money for something that is as good as money.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.450
A casino.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.370
Casinos are a money launderer’s best friend.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:08.690
You can go in there with a bag of dirty cash, exchange it for chips, go out and do a bit

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:14.800
of gambling if you like, then exchange the chips back for legal cash a few hours later.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.580
You’ll even get a piece of paper from the casino saying that this money is ‘gambling winnings’

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:27.540
and Bob’s your uncle, you can suddenly explain to the government where you got all that money.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.610
You can even put it into a bank, and if anyone asks any

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.110
questions, you have the proof that you won it in a casino.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.560
There’s a video from a Canadian casino of a Chinese customer coming in with

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:48.090
a hockey bag full of Canadian dollars and exchanging it all for casino chips.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.470
He comes in and passes this bag to the cashier, who puts it through the money

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:00.010
counting machine, and it takes a whole ten minutes to count all the cash.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.690
It’s pretty mad to watch.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.780
So, that’s the first stage, get the illegal money into the money system in the first place.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.290
It’s the most dangerous part of the process, because it’s the part

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:17.510
where it’s hardest to explain where the money originally came from.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.480
“A friend gave it to me” doesn’t quite work when

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.890
you’re talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.840
Our second stage is what’s called ‘Layering’.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.690
This stage has become much more important in recent years, as

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.660
anti-money laundering authorities have got smarter and smarter.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:44.500
What happens during this ‘layering’ phase is that the money is moved around and around,

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.990
as anonymously as possible to try and hide where it came from in the first place.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.250
This can be achieved in all sorts of ways, but as a general

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.090
rule, the more anonymous the money trail is, the better.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:07.480
This means that money is often moved through countries with pretty loose regulations, often small

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:14.650
islands - places like the Caymans, Panama, but also countries in the EU like Malta or Cyprus.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:21.380
The money is moved through shell companies, companies that only exist on paper

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:27.300
and whose owners are hidden, and it’s moved from company to company all across

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.540
the world so that it’s almost impossible to trace where it actually came from.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:38.150
If you’ve listened to the episode on 1MDB and the missing Malaysian

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:43.550
billions, the money from this huge fraud was laundered in exactly this way.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.960
But it’s not just small banks in tax havens that enable this.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:54.230
In recent years there have been dozens of scandals about some of the biggest

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:59.770
banks in the world enabling money laundering, either actively or passively.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:08.960
From UBS to HSBC, Barclays to Goldman Sachs, huge American, Swiss, and British banks in

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.310
countries that you might not necessarily associate with money laundering have all been

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:20.070
accused of helping criminals and in most cases, have paid large fines for doing so.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.080
So that is ‘layering’, the second step in the process, moving the money

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.850
around so much that it’s hard for anyone to see where it actually came from.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.120
Our final step is the bit that the money launderer has been

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.540
waiting for, the payday, and it’s called ‘Integration’.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:47.300
Now that the money is ‘clean’, that it is so far removed from its dirty origins, it can

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:53.590
be returned to its owner, and put back into the financial system in the form of assets.

00:10:54.519 --> 00:11:01.440
Whether that’s a house, a business, or some other financial investment, now that the criminal is

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:07.930
able to buy that asset with ‘clean’ money there is not much that the government can do about it.

00:11:08.893 --> 00:11:12.823
Pablo Escobar was famously just the owner of a taxi company,

00:11:13.123 --> 00:11:16.503
but one that generated hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:11:17.413 --> 00:11:23.163
Walter White, if you have seen the series Breaking Bad, ran a very profitable car wash.

00:11:23.773 --> 00:11:27.443
And if the money laundering has been done correctly, then

00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:31.193
it’s very hard for the police to actually prove anything.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.020
But if there is one thing that seems to be a recurrent

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.580
theme with criminals, is that they get greedy.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.920
If they got away with transferring an extra $500 a day into a

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.060
business, then why not try to transfer $1000, then $2000, and so on.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:56.330
If they got away with claiming that a small hairdresser made $500,000

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.720
in profit one year, why not try to claim it made $800,000 the next year.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.210
And eventually the money laundering police do cotton on, they suspect that there’s something

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:13.350
fishy going on, they start to look more closely at every single transaction, suddenly

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.310
the suspected criminal is being watched like a hawk, and then they end up in prison.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.180
The reality is though that most money laundering is never caught.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:29.020
It’s thought that money laundering accounts for up to 5% of global

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:35.790
GDP, so that’s between $800 billion and $2 trillion dollars.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:42.140
Because we don’t actually know how much it is, or where it comes from, it’s difficult

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.940
to figure out exactly what activities make up this money, but it’s thought that most

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:54.980
of it comes from drug cartels, terrorist syndicates, and the ultra-rich, the 0.01%.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:13:00.230
And while money laundering is often considered a ‘white collar’ crime, a

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.050
non-violent crime that doesn’t really hurt anyone because all it’s doing is

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:10.040
moving money around from place to place and in some cases avoiding tax, money

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.680
laundering is really the grease that enables the criminal wheels to turn.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.920
Without a way of being able to actually get the money at the end of it, the incentive for

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:28.350
criminal activity would be greatly reduced, and so one must assume, if you can clamp down on

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:35.610
the parties that enable money laundering, then this can have as great if not greater impact as

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.690
cracking down on the people on the other side of the criminal activity, whether it’s the ones

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:46.840
trafficking drugs onto the streets of Europe or buying AK47s to engage in terrorist activities.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.740
Of course, the authorities throughout the world are, to varying degrees,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.660
trying to do everything they can to crack down on money laundering,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:14:00.380
but as things like the Panama Papers have shown, it is really hard.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:07.770
The global financial system is structured so that it’s very easy, no matter how dirty the

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:13.720
origins of the money, to put it into the financial system and quickly move it all over the

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.730
world so that it becomes invisible and can be taken out clean and fresh somewhere else.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.140
When cryptocurrencies first became ‘mainstream’, or at least semi-understood and

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:32.280
you started hearing about them on the news, one of the common complaints waged

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:37.340
at them was that they were making life easier for criminals to move money around.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.220
A criminal could turn their dirty drug money into bitcoin, buy a gun on

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.650
the dark web with that bitcoin, and this was all completely anonymous.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.160
This was the fear at least.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.920
It’s partly true, in that a bitcoin wallet doesn’t have your name and

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:01.170
house address on it, but the impact of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.930
the world of money laundering has been minimal, it’s been absolutely tiny.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:13.850
Indeed, using cryptocurrency to launder money is a pretty dumb idea because bitcoin

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:19.980
transactions leave a permanent record that is impossible to get rid of, so you can

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:25.320
always see where a bitcoin came from, even if you can’t see the name of the individuals.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:31.620
So, for the purposes of money laundering, where the entire aim is to hide where

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.670
the money came from, bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not a great idea at all.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.460
As the old saying goes, cash is king.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.990
Cash is beautifully anonymous.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.780
It has no history, it won’t tell you where it came from, it won’t tell

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.350
you whose hands it passed through, for what goods and services, and when.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.940
And cash still makes up the vast majority of criminal payments.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:03.850
If cash is king, money laundering is its twin brother that takes a $20 bill exchanged on the

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:09.510
street between a drug addict and a dealer, deposits in a friendly bank somewhere in the United

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:15.390
States, then it flows to Panama, then to the Cayman Islands, then to Malta, back to the Cayman

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:20.720
Islands, probably a few more times around the globe, getting cleaner and more anonymous with

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:27.650
every stop, until it finally spins out of the global financial laundromat to be deposited at

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.440
well-known global bank, and spent in the fashionable nightclubs of New York, London, or Paris.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.480
Clean as a whistle.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:42.450
Ok then, that is it for the murky world of money laundering.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.390
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.900
something new about this deep, dark underworld of white collar crime.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:56.880
There are evidently loads of different ways that criminals launder money, and we’ve only touched

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:02.340
on a few of them, but I hope it’s given you an idea of some of the ways in which it works.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.780

I Imagine you don't have that much personal experience

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:17.808
with money laundering but nevertheless, I can't

00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:21.310
wait to hear what you

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:21.980

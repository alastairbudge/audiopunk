Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.359
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:21.749
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:30.059
I'm Alastair Budge and today is part three of our three-part series on Mormonism and Scientology.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:37.639
In part one we learned about the history of Mormonism, from its unusual founding story,

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:44.089
how Mormons ended up at Salt Lake City to how a Mormon almost became a US president.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:51.759
Then in part two it was on to Scientology, from its probably even more

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:57.469
bizarre founding story, its eccentric founder, L.Ron Hubbard, how it managed

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.399
to get a grip on Hollywood and of course, the controversies around it.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.839
If you haven’t listened to those two yet, I would recommend listening to them first, as

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:14.899
a knowledge of both Mormonism and Scientology will be helpful for getting the most out of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.099
today’s episode, where we are going to compare and contrast the two, and then leave with

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:27.649
some thoughts on what questions both these belief systems raise about religion in general.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.749
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.349
Now, you might be thinking that a comparison between Mormonism and Scientology is artificial,

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:45.969
that it is like comparing a dog to a watermelon, and that there is no value in it.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:51.312
It certainly isn’t a comparison that either group endorses.

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:58.515
To a Mormon, a belief in Scientology is wholly incompatible with their belief system.

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:04.185
And to a Scientologist, Mormonism is equally weird and strange.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:10.465
The system of worship is different, the belief in a God is different, the way in which

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:16.305
the organisation is structured is different, they are certainly different belief systems.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:21.235
But, as we will learn about in today’s episode, they have

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:24.375
more in common than either group might like to admit.

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:30.585
Let’s start with the founding story of the religion, because for both

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:36.425
Scientology and Mormonism, they are inseparable from the men who created it.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:41.115
For starters, the lives of both founders, Joseph Smith Junior and

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:45.415
L.Ron Hubbard have been greatly romanticised by their followers.

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:51.235
Smith’s story is, as you will remember, of a young boy who is visited

00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:57.275
by God and Jesus, told where to find these mysterious golden plates, and

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:01.605
translates an ancient Egyptian language to create The Book of Mormon.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:09.395
And for L.Ron Hubbard, his is the story of a war hero who creates a new self-help

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:14.775
system that he turns into a religion and becomes the foundation of Scientology.

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:18.485
That's the official policy line, of course.

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:26.965
But to a critic of Mormonism or Scientology, Smith’s story is of a charlatan, a fraudster

00:03:27.195 --> 00:03:33.065
who exploited the divisions of 19th Century America to draw people into his fraud.

00:03:34.045 --> 00:03:35.605
And for critics of L.

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:41.855
Ron Hubbard, he too is a fraudster, an out-of-luck science fiction writer who believes

00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:48.245
the key to wealth and success is by starting a religion, and he manages to rewrite

00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:54.425
history to position himself as a hero, when in fact he is nothing of the sort.

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:59.645
This leads us on to our second point of comparison, that

00:03:59.645 --> 00:04:03.955
both Mormonism and Scientology have been labelled a cult.

00:04:04.965 --> 00:04:11.375
Now, if you look up the definition of the world “cult” in a dictionary it will tell you that it

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:18.315
is something like “a system of religious devotion directed towards a particular figure or object”.

00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:24.645
The implicit suggestion when using the word “cult” is that the belief isn’t a

00:04:24.645 --> 00:04:30.205
genuine religion, that its followers believe in something that cannot be true

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:37.435
because it is so unorthodox and strange, and that they have been somehow tricked

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:42.865
into believing in it, because of the power of one extremely charismatic individual.

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:49.345
We’ll revisit this point later on, but it is an important thing to note

00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:54.455
that both Mormonism and Scientology have, ever since their founding,

00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:59.375
been considered to be unorthodox and non-traditional belief systems.

00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:02.915
This is especially true for Scientology.

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:08.045
Mormonism has become far more mainstream, more accepted.

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:13.815
Mitt Romney, the US Presidential candidate, was a famous practising mormon.

00:05:14.385 --> 00:05:21.135
The US ambassador to China and then Russia, a man called Jon Huntsman, was also a Mormon.

00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:27.055
But is the reason that Mormonism is now more accepted and mainstream

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:32.605
because it is is a more attractive, more sensible, more believable religion?

00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:36.865
Or is it just because it’s had more time to develop?

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:44.425
Mormonism 100 years ago, when the religion was at a similar stage of development to Scientology

00:05:44.425 --> 00:05:51.980
today, was considered to be as weird and cult-like as Scientology is in 2021, if not more.

00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:56.675
Scientology has not even existed for 70 years.

00:05:57.475 --> 00:06:04.895
Mormonism, 70 years into its existence had only just renounced polygamy, or plural marriage,

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:10.965
and was still considered to be a cult-like religion by the majority of the US population.

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:16.605
Indeed, the early days of Mormonism saw great violence against

00:06:16.605 --> 00:06:21.625
Mormons, with followers of the religion being attacked, and of course

00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:26.535
its leader, Joseph Smith Junior, being killed by an anti-Mormon mob.

00:06:27.825 --> 00:06:33.705
Scientology came over a hundred years later, in perhaps a slightly more civilised world,

00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:40.455
so there were fewer mobs attacking its followers, but it too was labelled a dangerous cult.

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:46.785
The current scepticism and opposition towards both Mormonism and Scientology

00:06:46.905 --> 00:06:51.945
is thought to be part of the reason that both religions are so secretive,

00:06:52.105 --> 00:06:56.935
that the inner workings of the church are unknown to non-believers.

00:06:57.805 --> 00:07:03.635
As we heard about in part one, you cannot go into a Mormon temple if you are a non-Mormon.

00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:09.745
And as for Scientology, it is even more secretive, with the inner

00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:14.245
workings of Scientology only available to those who have continued

00:07:14.405 --> 00:07:19.435
to progress to higher levels, and paid handsomely for the process.

00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:26.435
This leads us on to our next similarity, or at least our next point of comparison that

00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:32.705
people have made, and that is to do with the vast wealth that both The Mormon Church

00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:38.005
and The Church of Scientology have amassed over their relatively short lifespans.

00:07:39.005 --> 00:07:46.805
As a Mormon, you are encouraged, or perhaps I should say required, to pay 10% of your income

00:07:46.905 --> 00:07:54.055
to the church, which has led the church to have a reported $100 billion pile of assets.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:08:01.495
And even though there are far fewer Scientologists than Mormons, progressing through the levels

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:08.115
of Scientology can be very expensive, costing followers hundreds of thousands of dollars.

00:08:09.185 --> 00:08:13.475
This has meant that the Church of Scientology certainly isn’t short

00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:19.605
of cash either - it has an estimated $2 billion worth of assets,

00:08:19.795 --> 00:08:24.855
including large houses, boats, and other property all over the world.

00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:30.195
Its leader, David Miscavige, also reportedly travels everywhere on

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:35.035
a private jet and only wears custom-made leather shoes from London.

00:08:36.115 --> 00:08:41.345
Yet another similarity is about what a tight grip both religions hold on their

00:08:41.345 --> 00:08:46.615
followers, and how hard it is to actually leave the church once you are in.

00:08:47.465 --> 00:08:53.855
There are countless internet groups and forums of ex-Mormons and ex-Scientologists,

00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:59.125
where experiences are shared with others who have gone through a similar thing.

00:08:59.895 --> 00:09:01.165
Let’s start with Mormonism.

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:07.175
Mormons place a lot of importance on the family unit, and there are

00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:12.715
countless stories of heartbreak when one family member decides to leave.

00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:19.145
Naturally, this isn’t unique to Mormonism, and there are just as many stories

00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:24.925
of devout Catholics, Protestants, Muslims or Jews who have experienced

00:09:24.935 --> 00:09:30.045
similar family breakups when a child or sibling decides to leave the religion.

00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:35.575
When it comes to Scientology though, leaving is even harder.

00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:39.955
If someone looks like they are going to leave the church of Scientology,

00:09:40.215 --> 00:09:45.045
they are labelled a Suppressive Person, and the church will reportedly

00:09:45.155 --> 00:09:49.615
force other Scientologists to break off all contact with them.

00:09:50.845 --> 00:09:55.555
Mothers, fathers, sons and daughters, there are tales of families being

00:09:55.655 --> 00:10:00.748
torn apart because one person wants to stop being a Scientologist.

00:10:01.595 --> 00:10:08.495
As we heard about in the last episode, the Church of Scientology keeps detailed records on all of

00:10:08.495 --> 00:10:14.455
the personal confessions of its members during their auditing sessions, during their therapy-type

00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:22.535
sessions, and it is believed to use this material as blackmail to stop people leaving the church.

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:27.115
So, once you’re in, it’s not so easy to get out.

00:10:28.105 --> 00:10:32.265
Now, while it is possible to debate some of the similarities that we have

00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:36.775
mentioned, there is one similarity between the two that is undeniable.

00:10:37.925 --> 00:10:43.075
They are two of the most successful modern religions, if by modern

00:10:43.225 --> 00:10:48.005
we define this as being created in the past 200 years, and if by

00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:52.475
successful we define it as global influence and number of followers.

00:10:53.054 --> 00:10:55.944
No other actual religion comes close.

00:10:56.384 --> 00:11:03.404
There are, of course, other branches of religions, such as Pentecostalism and evangelical

00:11:03.624 --> 00:11:10.476
Anglicanism, but these are both branches of Christianity, they aren’t unique religions.

00:11:11.186 --> 00:11:12.476
Why is this then?

00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:17.026
What factors have allowed Mormonism and Scientology to flourish?

00:11:17.816 --> 00:11:22.646
We’ve discussed some of the factors, but there is one important one we

00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:28.826
haven’t yet covered in detail, and that is to do with where they were founded.

00:11:29.979 --> 00:11:33.089
They were both founded in The United States of America.

00:11:33.769 --> 00:11:40.229
For Mormonism, one of the reasons it is thought to have been adopted so enthusiastically

00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:46.089
by its early supporters is that it placed the Americas at the heart of its religion.

00:11:47.099 --> 00:11:52.569
To remind you, The Book of Mormon, the religious text at the heart of the religion,

00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:58.869
says that the United States is the Promised Land, that the Garden of Eden was located

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:06.329
in Missouri, and that early Jewish settlers had moved to the Americas in 600 BC.

00:12:07.089 --> 00:12:11.449
Naturally, in a country with such a strong sense that it is the

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:16.479
best country in the world, this message found a receptive audience.

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:23.219
And when it comes to Scientology, there is certainly something uniquely American

00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:29.159
about the story of a science fiction writer who becomes an amateur, self-taught,

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:35.799
psychotherapist, and later the head of an incredibly profitable church, with a religion

00:12:35.969 --> 00:12:42.049
based on aliens dropping people into volcanoes and blowing them up with atomic bombs.

00:12:43.149 --> 00:12:50.109
By uniquely American I certainly don’t mean gullible, or likely to believe improbable stories.

00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:56.319
But rather The United States of America as a country was only 50 years old when

00:12:56.319 --> 00:13:02.329
Mormonism was founded, and 175 years old when Scientology arrived on the scene.

00:13:03.229 --> 00:13:08.469
It was, and you could certainly argue still is, a land of opportunity,

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:13.189
where people are free to believe whatever they want to believe, however

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:17.549
unorthodox and unusual that might have sounded to people at the time.

00:13:18.179 --> 00:13:24.179
It was a country where a man could say he had found some gold plates, or a man could

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:29.329
say that he had developed a new psychiatric treatment and turn it into a religion.

00:13:29.989 --> 00:13:35.829
In more developed, older, countries when people comparable to Joseph Smith Junior or

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:40.129
L.Ron Hubbard had tried to start their own religions, they were quickly shut down.

00:13:42.013 --> 00:13:48.569
In 19th century China, just as Mormonism was getting started, a man called Hong Xiuquan

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:55.119
had claimed to be the Heavenly King and that he was the younger brother of Jesus Christ.

00:13:55.779 --> 00:14:00.509
Although he did manage to amass around 30,000 followers, he

00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:04.069
was captured by the authorities and killed while in custody.

00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:10.229
If you’re interested in learning more about this, the name for it is the Taiping Rebellion.

00:14:11.209 --> 00:14:16.039
Meanwhile in Europe of the 19th century, proclaiming that you had

00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:21.589
divine visions, or you were Jesus reincarnated was likely to mean being

00:14:21.599 --> 00:14:27.349
locked up in a mental asylum, being thrown in prison, or being executed.

00:14:28.339 --> 00:14:31.239
So, what does this tell us?

00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:36.019
What can we learn from the comparative success of these two new religions?

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:38.149
What can we take from all of this?

00:14:38.499 --> 00:14:44.929
And how does it make us think about our own religions, if indeed you are a religious person?

00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:52.469
The first thing to note is that, when you step back for a minute and think about the details of

00:14:52.469 --> 00:14:59.199
what any religion believes, it is hard to objectively say that one is more probable than the other.

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:05.239
You might hear about the story of Joseph Smith Junior and the golden plates, and learn about the

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:10.779
inconsistencies in The Book of Mormon and think, well how could anyone actually believe that?

00:15:11.699 --> 00:15:18.149
Or perhaps you might hear the founding story of Scientology, and of the galactic lord

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:24.149
Xenu who blows up humans with atomic bombs, and think, well that’s obviously not true.

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:31.789
But is this because the actual details of what Scientologists or Mormons believe are

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:37.959
so hard to fathom, so hard to believe, or is it because we know the founding story,

00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:44.319
because it is so comparatively recent, and therefore we are more cynical about it?

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:53.389
If the Bible, the Quran, or the Torah had been written 50 years ago and we knew the author, or the

00:15:53.389 --> 00:16:00.239
person who uncovered it, might we feel slightly differently about the actual content of these books?

00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:05.369
What an understanding of Mormonism and Scientology do help

00:16:05.409 --> 00:16:09.309
us with, I think, is an understanding of human nature.

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:16.489
As humans, we want to belong, we want to be part of something bigger than ourselves,

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:21.579
and we want to be part of something that we believe will make our lives better.

00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:27.859
For many people, exactly what that thing is isn’t the most important factor,

00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:32.239
the most important thing is to be part of something bigger than yourself.

00:16:33.169 --> 00:16:41.369
And even if you believe something that might, to the outside world, seem mad and defy all logic,

00:16:41.699 --> 00:16:48.069
even if someone sits you down and says, look, does it really seem probable that there were

00:16:48.089 --> 00:16:54.999
golden plates dug up from the earth, or that an intergalactic warlord thew humans into a volcano

00:16:55.179 --> 00:17:01.149
and blew them up with nuclear weapons, this doesn’t matter because you want to believe it.

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:07.599
Indeed, one could draw parallels with the number of people who believe in certain conspiracy

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:12.929
theories even when there is so much evidence that suggests that they are not true.

00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:19.119
For many of us, believing in something and feeling a sense of attachment

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:23.499
to that is almost more important than what that thing actually is.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:29.289
And coming back to Mormonism and Scientology, even though the religion - like

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:35.324
any religion - isn’t without its criticisms, there is a lot about the

00:17:36.244 --> 00:17:38.624
religion that does appear to help its followers lead happier lives.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.840
If you meet a Mormon on the street they almost always appear to be incredibly friendly people.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:50.910
Perhaps eerily friendly, especially to an antisocial Brit such

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.310
as myself, but they do tend to come across as nice and friendly.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:03.980
The emphasis on the family unit, and emphasis on helping others, is certainly a positive aspect,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:10.890
and the growth in the number of Mormons, and the relatively low level of people who leave

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:16.730
the church, suggests that it does provide meaning for millions of people around the world.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.670
And when it comes to Scientology, for certain people

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.090
it does appear to have helped them with their lives.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:32.130
For some Hollywood actors they credit it with helping them get off drugs, or helping

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:38.470
them be better friends or parents, and helping them live better, more fulfilled lives.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.310
And this, of course, isn’t unique to Mormonism or Scientology.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:48.470
Whether you are a practising Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, Jew, or whatever

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:52.890
other religion, perhaps your faith has helped you find meaning in your life.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:59.170
And if you are not a religious person, it is easy to look at the belief systems of other

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:04.720
religions, including Mormonism and Scientology, and think “what a load of rubbish”,

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.750
but they have clearly brought happiness and meaning to many of their followers.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:15.040
There are evidently some people for whom their religious upbringing, or religious

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:21.460
experiences, have caused great harm, but is this any greater for Mormonism

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:26.200
and Scientology than it is for any of the other, more established religions?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.870
I’m not so sure.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:35.870
So, to conclude this little exploration, what can we learn from Mormonism and Scientology?

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.700
Firstly, if you are a charismatic leader with an interesting

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.200
story, people will follow you, especially if you are in the USA.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:50.430
Secondly, these followers can be incredibly profitable,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.850
and your religion might turn into a mega business.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:01.990
Thirdly, you will not be short of critics, of those who say that your religion is a load of rubbish.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.380
But you shouldn’t worry too much about that, because the more

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.270
you are criticised, the more strongly people will believe in you.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.300
And finally, if more established religions are any example, it might take

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:22.030
time, thousands of years even for your religion to become more widely accepted.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.940
So, who knows what religions, if any, people will be following in thousands of years from now.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.790
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Mormonism vs.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.230
Scientology, and with that comes the end of this little

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:46.310
mini-series on these two new but increasingly influential religions

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.670
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this series in general.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.660
Are you a Mormon or a Scientologist, or do you have any

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.410
Mormon or Scientologist friends, family members or colleagues?

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:05.620
What do you think we can learn, if anything, from these two new religions?

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.340
I would love to know.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.790

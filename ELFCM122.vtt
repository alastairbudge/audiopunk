Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.839
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.339
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.129
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.969
about Bitcoin, the most famous cryptocurrency in the world.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.979
We’re going to explain what it is, how exactly it works, why some people

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.869
think it is the future of money and others think it is a giant bubble.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.459
I’m really excited about today’s one, and I hope you will enjoy it.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.719
Before we get right into that though, let me quickly remind you that you can get all of

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.179
the bonus episodes, plus the subtitles, that transcript and the key vocabulary for this

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.149
episode and all of our other ones over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:08.915
This is also where you can check out becoming a member of Leonardo English

00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:13.895
and join a community of curious minds from all over the world, doing meetups,

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.935
exchanging ideas, and generally improving their English in a more interesting way.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:23.675
So if that is of interest, and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:28.025
wouldn't be, then the place to go to is Leonardoenglish.com

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:31.452
OK then, Bitcoin.

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:35.702
I guess I should probably start this episode by saying

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:38.632
that this is not some kind of financial promotion.

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:42.932
All we are going to try to do is understand a little bit more

00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:47.592
about this type of money that has come to dominate the newscycle.

00:01:49.052 --> 00:01:52.982
Before we jump right into the question of what Bitcoin is,

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:58.192
it’s helpful to start by talking a little bit about money.

00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:00.712
So, what is money?

00:02:01.382 --> 00:02:08.482
Money is a store of value, and this money can be exchanged for stuff.

00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:14.772
The company you work for pays you money because you do valuable work for them,

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:20.182
you pay someone else money because they might do something that you consider

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:25.962
valuable like serve you a coffee or sell you a newspaper or make podcasts for you.

00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:30.142
That’s the basic idea of how money works.

00:02:31.432 --> 00:02:36.162
Throughout history, different things were used to represent money.

00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:40.502
Different societies used different ways of representing

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:45.212
it, from shells, to silver, and of course, gold.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:51.372
But using physical objects, especially metal like gold,

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:55.802
wasn’t a very good way of storing or exchanging value.

00:02:56.652 --> 00:03:01.292
It’s heavy, it’s not easy to transport, and it's just

00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:05.582
not very practical to be used as a medium of exchange.

00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:09.312
So, the paper banknote was invented.

00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:16.682
The idea here was that you could store your gold in a bank, and the bank would

00:03:16.722 --> 00:03:22.782
give a note that you could pass to other people in exchange for goods or services.

00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:30.922
Technically, you could go to the bank and get the gold, but if you just wanted to do things

00:03:30.962 --> 00:03:36.912
like buy food, there was no need to, because you knew that you could give that note to

00:03:36.912 --> 00:03:42.542
someone else in exchange for more stuff, you didn't need to go and get the gold from the bank.

00:03:43.492 --> 00:03:47.762
The whole system worked because people knew that the gold did

00:03:47.762 --> 00:03:50.662
exist in the bank, they could go and get it if they wanted.

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:59.452
But from 1971, paper money was no longer linked to gold, and instead,

00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:05.162
the government effectively guaranteed the value of your paper money.

00:04:05.932 --> 00:04:10.532
There was nothing physical behind the paper money, you just had

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:14.472
to trust that the paper money would keep its value in the future.

00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:18.292
The world had essentially transitioned to a system

00:04:18.522 --> 00:04:21.142
where money was controlled by the central government.

00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:28.682
Your paper money doesn’t have any intrinsic value, its only value is because you know

00:04:28.682 --> 00:04:33.802
that everyone else agrees that it’s valuable, and the whole system works like that.

00:04:35.302 --> 00:04:41.292
The advantage of this system for a government is that, because there is nothing behind the

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:48.492
paper money, it’s easy to create more of it, to add more money to the economy and pay for stuff.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:55.842
Although printing money sounds nice in principle, the more money that exists

00:04:56.092 --> 00:05:02.582
in a financial system, the less value each unit of money actually has.

00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:09.842
When prices rise due to inflation, this isn’t because prices naturally

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:15.152
rise, it's because there is more money in the system, so each bit of

00:05:15.162 --> 00:05:19.092
money that we have in the system is worth less and less every year.

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:25.982
And there are plenty of instances throughout history of governments printing too much

00:05:25.982 --> 00:05:31.792
money too quickly, there being more and more money in the financial system so that

00:05:31.832 --> 00:05:37.752
each unit of money is worth less, and the situation quickly spirals out of control.

00:05:39.002 --> 00:05:43.512
The obvious examples one would point at would be things like Germany

00:05:43.632 --> 00:05:49.382
in the 1920s, Zimbabwe in the 2000s, or Venezuela in more recent years.

00:05:50.232 --> 00:05:57.432
But even in the UK in 1975 inflation was at 25%, meaning

00:05:57.642 --> 00:06:02.112
that your money would be worth 25% less in 12 months time.

00:06:03.255 --> 00:06:08.589
But this episode isn’t just about money, the point is that governments control the

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:13.429
supply of money, and people have to trust the government to do the right thing.

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.589
And governments don’t always have a great track record at doing this.

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.729
But it’s not just the government that you have to trust.

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:24.999
You also have to trust the banks.

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:30.979
The implicit deal that you make, when you put money in a bank, is that the

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:35.699
bank will keep it safe, and it will allow you to make payments with it.

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:41.749
And again, banks don’t have a fantastic track record at keeping your money safe.

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:47.529
So banks control your money on a daily basis, while the

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.249
government controls the total amount of money in the system.

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:58.309
If you use Euros, dollars, or any other what’s called a ‘fiat’ currency,

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:03.709
a currency that isn’t backed by anything like gold, you rely on this

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:08.209
combination of the government and banks to keep everything ticking over.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:14.799
But from financial crashes to fraud to mismanagement, neither

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:20.259
governments nor banks have that great a history at doing the right thing.

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:27.149
So, this is the backstory, a little very quick intro to the complicated

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:32.289
world of financial systems that all rely on one thing: trust.

00:07:33.489 --> 00:07:40.129
Just over 10 years ago a new idea emerged about how money could work that

00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:45.909
proposed a radically different way of thinking about the issue of trust.

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:54.449
In 2009, someone with the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper,

00:07:54.549 --> 00:08:01.189
a document, introducing this new idea, a new type of money that didn’t require any

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:07.219
banks or governments, that could be sent by anyone in the world to anyone else in

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:13.619
the world, that aimed to solve a lot of the problems that exist with modern money.

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:17.479
The name of the invention was Bitcoin.

00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:21.329
Bitcoin works on a few principles.

00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:24.039
Firstly, there is no physical bitcoin.

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:29.159
It’s a cryptocurrency, so it only exists as computer code.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:36.549
It's what’s called ‘open source’, so anyone can see the computer code that controls it.

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:43.539
Nobody ‘owns’ the bitcoin network, anyone who owns a bitcoin owns part of

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:48.019
it, but there isn’t a central system, it’s what’s called decentralised.

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:56.089
If you own bitcoin, you store it in a bitcoin wallet, which is a piece of software

00:08:56.109 --> 00:09:02.569
on your computer or mobile phone and contains a unique set of numbers and letters.

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:07.989
That’s your bitcoin wallet’s address, and in there is your bitcoin.

00:09:09.369 --> 00:09:14.919
When it comes to making a payment in bitcoin, a crucial difference here versus

00:09:15.249 --> 00:09:20.219
normal money is that you don’t need any kind of bank to make the transfer.

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:27.299
With a normal transfer or payment in Euros or dollars, your money goes through all

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:32.899
sorts of different providers and banks before it actually reaches the other person.

00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:38.579
With Bitcoin, it goes straight from your bitcoin wallet to their

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:44.549
bitcoin wallet, and the information about this transaction is added to

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:49.469
a public record of every bitcoin transaction that has ever been made.

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:51.729
This is called the blockchain.

00:09:51.729 --> 00:10:00.339
This chain is basically like a huge record of who has paid what, to whom, when.

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:08.689
Unlike with a bank, it isn’t kept locked up in some large building, it exists on

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:14.389
thousands of different computers all over the world, and is public, anyone can see it.

00:10:15.619 --> 00:10:20.349
Whenever a new bitcoin transaction is made, one of the computers in the

00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:26.139
network will verify that transaction and then add it to the public record.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:32.329
When it’s added to the record, other computers will check that the record

00:10:32.359 --> 00:10:37.559
is still the same, that no changes have been made, and then it is added.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:43.909
You can’t see who actually owns each bitcoin, but you can

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:48.019
see the bitcoin address of who sent it and who received it.

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:54.399
The advantage of everything being public and unable to be changed

00:10:54.419 --> 00:10:58.799
is that you can’t ever have a situation where a payment is made

00:10:58.849 --> 00:11:03.269
twice, or money is taken from your account without your permission.

00:11:04.609 --> 00:11:08.739
Similarly, you can’t wake up and find that a bank has taken your

00:11:08.739 --> 00:11:13.399
money, because the bank doesn’t control the account, you do.

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:21.019
So, although many people might feel very strange about having money in a computer, money

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:28.009
that they can’t feel or touch, and with no bank that they can go to, no nice person they can

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:33.309
phone up and certainly no statements coming through their letterbox every month, bitcoin’s

00:11:33.929 --> 00:11:42.099
advocates propose it as a much safer, more secure way to store money, to store value.

00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:49.879
The final, perhaps most important reason that Bitcoin has so many fans is

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:55.129
because there are only a fixed number of bitcoins that can ever be produced.

00:11:56.259 --> 00:12:01.339
Specifically, there are only 21 million bitcoins that can ever exist.

00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:08.539
If you remember the start of the episode when I mentioned inflation and governments

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:14.969
printing money, the reason that having a fixed number of bitcoins is important is

00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:21.339
because bitcoin can’t be affected by inflation in the same way was as fiat currency.

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:29.139
Inflation only exists when new money is added to the supply, and because

00:12:29.179 --> 00:12:34.819
the supply of bitcoins that will ever exist is fixed, this can’t happen.

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:41.559
But then you’re probably thinking, hang on, I’ve seen stuff in the news about

00:12:41.779 --> 00:12:47.359
the bitcoin price shooting up or coming crashing down, what’s that all about?

00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:55.139
Indeed, the price of bitcoin, in US Dollars or Euros, is very volatile.

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:57.579
It goes up and down a lot.

00:12:58.949 --> 00:13:03.489
There’s almost no point me saying what the price is at the moment because

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:08.639
no doubt by the time you listen to this it’ll be very different, and it

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:12.759
doesn't really matter what the price is for the purposes of this explanation.

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:18.695
The price of Bitcoin is driven, like anything else, by supply and

00:13:18.695 --> 00:13:23.195
demand; if there are lots of people who want to buy Bitcoin, the

00:13:23.255 --> 00:13:27.935
price goes up and when more people want to sell, the price goes down.

00:13:28.637 --> 00:13:33.712
Because the total value of all the Bitcoin in the world is very small

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:39.022
compared to other currencies, when there is a change in demand for buying or

00:13:39.022 --> 00:13:44.182
selling, this can have a big impact on the price, it can move significantly.

00:13:45.322 --> 00:13:50.272
And because the price changes frequently, there are a lot more people

00:13:50.332 --> 00:13:55.912
speculating on Bitcoin, which has the effect of making it even more volatile.

00:13:56.629 --> 00:14:01.549
And you will, no doubt have seen that the price rises and falls a lot.

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:12.099
Indeed in 2020, it went up by 269%, but after shooting up by more than 20 times

00:14:12.099 --> 00:14:20.289
in 2017, it came crashing down to less than f20% of its value shortly after.

00:14:21.407 --> 00:14:25.467
And this is one of the big criticisms of bitcoin.

00:14:26.457 --> 00:14:30.547
It’s been called a bubble, a scam, a fraud, and

00:14:30.797 --> 00:14:34.717
something that can never be used as a true form of money.

00:14:35.537 --> 00:14:42.897
To actually make transactions with, to buy and sell things with, the fact that its price in US

00:14:42.897 --> 00:14:50.197
dollars or Euros changes so quickly makes it very hard to use as a way of buying and selling stuff.

00:14:51.377 --> 00:14:55.897
To give you a working example, if you are a pizza restaurant that

00:14:56.047 --> 00:15:01.077
accepts payment in bitcoin, I might call up and ask for two pizzas.

00:15:01.577 --> 00:15:04.777
The price would be set in bitcoin, which would be

00:15:04.777 --> 00:15:08.147
based on how much these pizzas would cost in euros.

00:15:08.627 --> 00:15:13.727
Let’s say the value of these pizzas was €20 in normal, fiat

00:15:13.727 --> 00:15:18.317
money, but I had placed the order for a fixed price in bitcoin.

00:15:19.767 --> 00:15:25.767
What if suddenly the bitcoin price changed, if the bitcoin price went up 10 times?

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:30.427
I would still need to give you the same amount of bitcoin, but

00:15:30.677 --> 00:15:35.707
instead of it costing me the equivalent of €20 to buy those pizzas

00:15:36.127 --> 00:15:41.397
it would cost me €200, so I would probably feel a little bit silly.

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:49.047
This isn’t just a theoretical situation, and the reason I used the example of two

00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:55.267
pizzas was because the first things that were ever bought with bitcoin were, two pizzas.

00:15:56.167 --> 00:16:02.707
A man on an internet forum offered someone 10,000 bitcoin to deliver him two pizzas.

00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:10.777
These 10,000 bitcoins were at the time worth around $42, but would be

00:16:10.777 --> 00:16:15.897
worth, at the time of recording this podcast, almost $200,000 dollars.

00:16:16.887 --> 00:16:22.447
Evidently, the fact that the bitcoin price moves up and down so much means

00:16:22.637 --> 00:16:28.507
that it’s not yet practical to be used to buy and sell anything at any date

00:16:28.537 --> 00:16:34.597
in the future - it’s only ever sort of practical to make purchases right now.

00:16:35.747 --> 00:16:40.127
So that’s why you might see places like Starbucks accepting

00:16:40.137 --> 00:16:45.087
bitcoin, but it’s not so common to see houses for sale in bitcoin.

00:16:45.638 --> 00:16:50.378
While some governments are embracing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, saying

00:16:50.588 --> 00:16:54.948
that they will be the future of money, others are trying to clamp down on them.

00:16:55.728 --> 00:17:00.888
Being in control of the money supply is a very important thing for any government,

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:06.078
which means you can put money into the economy in the short term, for example

00:17:06.298 --> 00:17:09.778
if there’s a devastating pandemic and you need to stimulate the economy.

00:17:10.748 --> 00:17:16.138
If everyone in a country uses a currency that isn’t controlled by that country’s

00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:21.528
government, then the government can’t print money, it can’t easily raise money

00:17:21.528 --> 00:17:26.688
to pay for things, and that has got a lot of countries’ governments very scared.

00:17:27.918 --> 00:17:31.108
And the country that is perhaps the most scared of Bitcoin?

00:17:32.228 --> 00:17:33.248
The United States.

00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:37.958
The US is particularly afraid of what Bitcoin could become

00:17:38.188 --> 00:17:42.268
because the US has the world’s reserve currency, the dollar.

00:17:43.418 --> 00:17:48.548
The Federal Reserve controls the supply of the US dollar, and it just adds and

00:17:48.588 --> 00:17:53.468
adds to it every month, so there is more money for the US government to spend.

00:17:54.128 --> 00:17:59.848
It seems like magic, and it is a super useful tool for governments to be able to use.

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:07.958
But if everyone used Bitcoin, this magical tool in a government’s toolbox just vanishes.

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:15.188
There are all sorts of other reasons that some people love bitcoin, and other people hate

00:18:15.198 --> 00:18:21.178
it, and unfortunately we don’t have time to go into detail on each and every one today.

00:18:21.978 --> 00:18:27.088
But, to recap, for the die-hard proponents of bitcoin, the people who

00:18:27.348 --> 00:18:31.708
vehemently believe it will be the money of the future, the key reasons are:

00:18:32.638 --> 00:18:36.378
Firstly, that it means you are in control of your money,

00:18:36.568 --> 00:18:40.548
not a government or a bank, it can’t just be taken away.

00:18:41.618 --> 00:18:48.208
Secondly, that it is truly borderless, that you can send it to anyone, anytime, without

00:18:48.218 --> 00:18:54.408
having to worry about currency exchanges or limits on where and when you can transfer money.

00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:59.808
And finally that it can’t be devalued in the same way

00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:03.598
that fiat currency can, that it will hold its value.

00:19:04.848 --> 00:19:10.718
And for those that think it’s a huge scam and should be stopped, the main reasons are:

00:19:11.328 --> 00:19:15.208
Firstly, that it has a troubled relationship with criminality.

00:19:16.258 --> 00:19:22.498
Because bitcoin is anonymous, and because it is easy to send to anywhere in

00:19:22.498 --> 00:19:28.078
the world at the click of a button it has been associated with transactions

00:19:28.098 --> 00:19:34.108
involving drugs, weapons, terrorism and all sorts of very nasty things.

00:19:35.568 --> 00:19:40.698
Secondly, because the price is so volatile the argument goes

00:19:40.838 --> 00:19:44.788
that it cannot ever be used as a true medium of exchange.

00:19:45.608 --> 00:19:51.488
For a currency to be useful as a way of buying and selling stuff that currency’s

00:19:51.798 --> 00:19:57.968
value has to be relatively stable, and bitcoin’s value is far from it.

00:19:59.278 --> 00:20:03.398
And thirdly, the ability to control the money supply is a

00:20:03.398 --> 00:20:06.768
hugely valuable thing for a government to be able to do.

00:20:07.738 --> 00:20:11.718
With bitcoin, it can’t do it and that’s scary.

00:20:13.058 --> 00:20:16.758
There is one thing that I’m sure both sides can agree on though.

00:20:17.528 --> 00:20:21.438
That the first two pizzas to ever be bought in bitcoin were

00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:25.488
probably the most expensive pizzas in the history of pizza delivery.

00:20:26.538 --> 00:20:27.808
And the worst thing about that?

00:20:28.488 --> 00:20:31.728
I’ve seen a picture of them and they don’t even look very nice.

00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:39.008
Ok then, that is it for the weird and wonderful world of bitcoin.

00:20:40.018 --> 00:20:44.188
It is very complicated, and we have only scratched the surface.

00:20:44.798 --> 00:20:49.558
But I hope that this has helped explain a bit about it, and some

00:20:49.598 --> 00:20:53.448
of the main reasons that some people love it and others hate it.

00:20:54.698 --> 00:20:59.978
At least now, when you see someone waxing lyrical on the news, when you see someone

00:21:00.268 --> 00:21:05.008
telling you why it’s the future, or you see someone else telling you that it is a

00:21:05.088 --> 00:21:10.158
massive fraud, then you’ll have a bit more of an idea about what they’re talking about.

00:21:10.938 --> 00:21:15.378

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:16.839
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.339
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.129
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.969
about Bitcoin, the most famous cryptocurrency in the world.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.979
We’re going to explain what it is, how exactly it works, why some people

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.869
think it is the future of money and others think it is a giant bubble.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.459
I’m really excited about today’s one, and I hope you will enjoy it.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.359
Before we get right into that though, I just wanted to tell

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.299
you about something else I’m really, really, excited about.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.579
Leonardo English has teamed up with an absolutely awesome English teacher

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.609
called Amy, from Vancouver, and she has kindly agreed to give a one

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.009
hour private lesson to anyone who becomes a Learner member for the year.

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:21.039
If you’re thinking that 2021 will be the year that you really improve your English, and you are

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.709
ready to do it with podcasts, transcripts, subtitles and key vocabulary, then you are in luck.

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:35.577
Until January 31st if you join as an annual Learner member you will get a one hour, private lesson

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:43.007
with Amy, where she will assess your level, help you define your goals, and set you up for success.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:48.597
Just one word of warning though - because Amy is in super high

00:01:48.627 --> 00:01:52.657
demand, we have to limit this to the first 50 people to join.

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:59.227
This episode is scheduled to come out on January the 8th, so I hope there

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:03.357
will still be some slots left, but I guess they will fill up pretty fast.

00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:08.167
So, if that is of interest, and I can’t see a reason why it

00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:12.587
wouldn’t be, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:16.307
OK then, Bitcoin.

00:02:17.257 --> 00:02:20.557
I guess I should probably start this episode by saying

00:02:20.797 --> 00:02:23.487
that this is not some kind of financial promotion.

00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:27.787
All we are going to try to do is understand a little bit more

00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:32.447
about this type of money that has come to dominate the newscycle.

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:37.837
Before we jump right into the question of what Bitcoin is,

00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:43.047
it’s helpful to start by talking a little bit about money.

00:02:43.737 --> 00:02:45.567
So, what is money?

00:02:46.237 --> 00:02:53.337
Money is a store of value, and this money can be exchanged for stuff.

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:59.627
The company you work for pays you money because you do valuable work for them,

00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:05.037
you pay someone else money because they might do something that you consider

00:03:05.037 --> 00:03:10.817
valuable like serve you a coffee or sell you a newspaper or make podcasts for you.

00:03:11.687 --> 00:03:14.997
That’s the basic idea of how money works.

00:03:16.287 --> 00:03:21.017
Throughout history, different things were used to represent money.

00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:25.357
Different societies used different ways of representing

00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:30.067
it, from shells, to silver, and of course, gold.

00:03:31.387 --> 00:03:36.227
But using physical objects, especially metal like gold,

00:03:36.857 --> 00:03:40.657
wasn’t a very good way of storing or exchanging value.

00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:46.147
It’s heavy, it’s not easy to transport, and it's just

00:03:46.147 --> 00:03:50.437
not very practical to be used as a medium of exchange.

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:54.167
So, the paper banknote was invented.

00:03:55.487 --> 00:04:01.537
The idea here was that you could store your gold in a bank, and the bank would

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:07.637
give a note that you could pass to other people in exchange for goods or services.

00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:15.777
Technically, you could go to the bank and get the gold, but if you just wanted to do things

00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:21.767
like buy food, there was no need to, because you knew that you could give that note to

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:27.397
someone else in exchange for more stuff, you didn't need to go and get the gold from the bank.

00:04:28.347 --> 00:04:32.617
The whole system worked because people knew that the gold did

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:35.517
exist in the bank, they could go and get it if they wanted.

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:44.307
But from 1971, paper money was no longer linked to gold, and instead,

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:50.017
the government effectively guaranteed the value of your paper money.

00:04:50.787 --> 00:04:55.387
There was nothing physical behind the paper money, you just had

00:04:55.397 --> 00:04:59.327
to trust that the paper money would keep its value in the future.

00:05:00.327 --> 00:05:03.147
The world had essentially transitioned to a system

00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:05.997
where money was controlled by the central government.

00:05:06.727 --> 00:05:13.537
Your paper money doesn’t have any intrinsic value, its only value is because you know

00:05:13.537 --> 00:05:18.657
that everyone else agrees that it’s valuable, and the whole system works like that.

00:05:20.157 --> 00:05:26.147
The advantage of this system for a government is that, because there is nothing behind the

00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:33.347
paper money, it’s easy to create more of it, to add more money to the economy and pay for stuff.

00:05:34.627 --> 00:05:40.697
Although printing money sounds nice in principle, the more money that exists

00:05:40.947 --> 00:05:47.437
in a financial system, the less value each unit of money actually has.

00:05:48.597 --> 00:05:54.697
When prices rise due to inflation, this isn’t because prices naturally

00:05:54.697 --> 00:06:00.007
rise, it's because there is more money in the system, so each bit of

00:06:00.017 --> 00:06:03.947
money that we have in the system is worth less and less every year.

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:10.837
And there are plenty of instances throughout history of governments printing too much

00:06:10.837 --> 00:06:16.647
money too quickly, there being more and more money in the financial system so that

00:06:16.687 --> 00:06:22.607
each unit of money is worth less, and the situation quickly spirals out of control.

00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:28.367
The obvious examples one would point at would be things like Germany

00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:34.237
in the 1920s, Zimbabwe in the 2000s, or Venezuela in more recent years.

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:42.287
But even in the UK in 1975 inflation was at 25%, meaning

00:06:42.497 --> 00:06:46.967
that your money would be worth 25% less in 12 months time.

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:53.443
But this episode isn’t just about money, the point is that governments control the

00:06:53.443 --> 00:06:58.283
supply of money, and people have to trust the government to do the right thing.

00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:03.443
And governments don’t always have a great track record at doing this.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:07.583
But it’s not just the government that you have to trust.

00:07:07.883 --> 00:07:09.853
You also have to trust the banks.

00:07:10.573 --> 00:07:15.833
The implicit deal that you make, when you put money in a bank, is that the

00:07:15.843 --> 00:07:20.553
bank will keep it safe, and it will allow you to make payments with it.

00:07:21.203 --> 00:07:26.603
And again, banks don’t have a fantastic track record at keeping your money safe.

00:07:27.603 --> 00:07:32.383
So banks control your money on a daily basis, while the

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:36.103
government controls the total amount of money in the system.

00:07:36.953 --> 00:07:43.163
If you use Euros, dollars, or any other what’s called a ‘fiat’ currency,

00:07:43.373 --> 00:07:48.563
a currency that isn’t backed by anything like gold, you rely on this

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:53.063
combination of the government and banks to keep everything ticking over.

00:07:54.283 --> 00:07:59.653
But from financial crashes to fraud to mismanagement, neither

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:05.113
governments nor banks have that great a history at doing the right thing.

00:08:06.323 --> 00:08:12.003
So, this is the backstory, a little very quick intro to the complicated

00:08:12.013 --> 00:08:17.143
world of financial systems that all rely on one thing: trust.

00:08:18.343 --> 00:08:24.983
Just over 10 years ago a new idea emerged about how money could work that

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:30.763
proposed a radically different way of thinking about the issue of trust.

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:39.303
In 2009, someone with the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper,

00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:46.043
a document, introducing this new idea, a new type of money that didn’t require any

00:08:46.053 --> 00:08:52.073
banks or governments, that could be sent by anyone in the world to anyone else in

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:58.473
the world, that aimed to solve a lot of the problems that exist with modern money.

00:08:59.803 --> 00:09:02.333
The name of the invention was Bitcoin.

00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:06.183
Bitcoin works on a few principles.

00:09:06.723 --> 00:09:08.893
Firstly, there is no physical bitcoin.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:14.013
It’s a cryptocurrency, so it only exists as computer code.

00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:21.403
It's what’s called ‘open source’, so anyone can see the computer code that controls it.

00:09:22.073 --> 00:09:28.393
Nobody ‘owns’ the bitcoin network, anyone who owns a bitcoin owns part of

00:09:28.393 --> 00:09:32.873
it, but there isn’t a central system, it’s what’s called decentralised.

00:09:33.363 --> 00:09:40.943
If you own bitcoin, you store it in a bitcoin wallet, which is a piece of software

00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:47.423
on your computer or mobile phone and contains a unique set of numbers and letters.

00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:52.843
That’s your bitcoin wallet’s address, and in there is your bitcoin.

00:09:54.223 --> 00:09:59.773
When it comes to making a payment in bitcoin, a crucial difference here versus

00:10:00.103 --> 00:10:05.073
normal money is that you don’t need any kind of bank to make the transfer.

00:10:06.233 --> 00:10:12.153
With a normal transfer or payment in Euros or dollars, your money goes through all

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:17.753
sorts of different providers and banks before it actually reaches the other person.

00:10:18.883 --> 00:10:23.433
With Bitcoin, it goes straight from your bitcoin wallet to their

00:10:24.213 --> 00:10:29.403
bitcoin wallet, and the information about this transaction is added to

00:10:29.403 --> 00:10:34.323
a public record of every bitcoin transaction that has ever been made.

00:10:35.113 --> 00:10:36.583
This is called the blockchain.

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:45.193
This chain is basically like a huge record of who has paid what, to whom, when.

00:10:46.683 --> 00:10:53.543
Unlike with a bank, it isn’t kept locked up in some large building, it exists on

00:10:53.563 --> 00:10:59.243
thousands of different computers all over the world, and is public, anyone can see it.

00:11:00.473 --> 00:11:05.203
Whenever a new bitcoin transaction is made, one of the computers in the

00:11:05.203 --> 00:11:10.993
network will verify that transaction and then add it to the public record.

00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:17.183
When it’s added to the record, other computers will check that the record

00:11:17.213 --> 00:11:22.413
is still the same, that no changes have been made, and then it is added.

00:11:23.653 --> 00:11:28.763
You can’t see who actually owns each bitcoin, but you can

00:11:28.763 --> 00:11:32.873
see the bitcoin address of who sent it and who received it.

00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:39.253
The advantage of everything being public and unable to be changed

00:11:39.273 --> 00:11:43.653
is that you can’t ever have a situation where a payment is made

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:48.123
twice, or money is taken from your account without your permission.

00:11:49.463 --> 00:11:53.593
Similarly, you can’t wake up and find that a bank has taken your

00:11:53.593 --> 00:11:58.253
money, because the bank doesn’t control the account, you do.

00:11:59.493 --> 00:12:05.873
So, although many people might feel very strange about having money in a computer, money

00:12:06.123 --> 00:12:12.863
that they can’t feel or touch, and with no bank that they can go to, no nice person they can

00:12:12.863 --> 00:12:18.163
phone up and certainly no statements coming through their letterbox every month, bitcoin’s

00:12:18.783 --> 00:12:26.953
advocates propose it as a much safer, more secure way to store money, to store value.

00:12:28.463 --> 00:12:34.733
The final, perhaps most important reason that Bitcoin has so many fans is

00:12:34.773 --> 00:12:39.983
because there are only a fixed number of bitcoins that can ever be produced.

00:12:41.113 --> 00:12:46.193
Specifically, there are only 21 million bitcoins that can ever exist.

00:12:47.673 --> 00:12:53.393
If you remember the start of the episode when I mentioned inflation and governments

00:12:53.493 --> 00:12:59.823
printing money, the reason that having a fixed number of bitcoins is important is

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:06.193
because bitcoin can’t be affected by inflation in the same way was as fiat currency.

00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:13.993
Inflation only exists when new money is added to the supply, and because

00:13:14.033 --> 00:13:19.673
the supply of bitcoins that will ever exist is fixed, this can’t happen.

00:13:21.063 --> 00:13:26.413
But then you’re probably thinking, hang on, I’ve seen stuff in the news about

00:13:26.633 --> 00:13:32.213
the bitcoin price shooting up or coming crashing down, what’s that all about?

00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:39.993
Indeed, the price of bitcoin, in US Dollars or Euros, is very volatile.

00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:42.433
It goes up and down a lot.

00:13:43.803 --> 00:13:48.343
There’s almost no point me saying what the price is at the moment because

00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:53.493
no doubt by the time you listen to this it’ll be very different, and it

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:57.613
doesn't really matter what the price is for the purposes of this explanation.

00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:03.549
The price of Bitcoin is driven, like anything else, by supply and

00:14:03.549 --> 00:14:08.049
demand; if there are lots of people who want to buy Bitcoin, the

00:14:08.109 --> 00:14:12.789
price goes up and when more people want to sell, the price goes down.

00:14:13.491 --> 00:14:18.567
Because the total value of all the Bitcoin in the world is very small

00:14:18.567 --> 00:14:23.877
compared to other currencies, when there is a change in demand for buying or

00:14:23.877 --> 00:14:29.037
selling, this can have a big impact on the price, it can move significantly.

00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:35.127
And because the price changes frequently, there are a lot more people

00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:40.767
speculating on Bitcoin, which has the effect of making it even more volatile.

00:14:41.484 --> 00:14:46.404
And you will, no doubt have seen that the price rises and falls a lot.

00:14:47.154 --> 00:14:56.953
Indeed in 2020, it went up by 269%, but after shooting up by more than 20 times

00:14:56.953 --> 00:15:05.143
in 2017, it came crashing down to less than f20% of its value shortly after.

00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:10.321
And this is one of the big criticisms of bitcoin.

00:15:11.311 --> 00:15:15.401
It’s been called a bubble, a scam, a fraud, and

00:15:15.651 --> 00:15:19.571
something that can never be used as a true form of money.

00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:27.751
To actually make transactions with, to buy and sell things with, the fact that its price in US

00:15:27.751 --> 00:15:35.051
dollars or Euros changes so quickly makes it very hard to use as a way of buying and selling stuff.

00:15:36.231 --> 00:15:40.751
To give you a working example, if you are a pizza restaurant that

00:15:40.901 --> 00:15:45.931
accepts payment in bitcoin, I might call up and ask for two pizzas.

00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:49.631
The price would be set in bitcoin, which would be

00:15:49.631 --> 00:15:53.001
based on how much these pizzas would cost in euros.

00:15:53.481 --> 00:15:58.581
Let’s say the value of these pizzas was €20 in normal, fiat

00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:03.171
money, but I had placed the order for a fixed price in bitcoin.

00:16:04.621 --> 00:16:10.621
What if suddenly the bitcoin price changed, if the bitcoin price went up 10 times?

00:16:11.581 --> 00:16:15.281
I would still need to give you the same amount of bitcoin, but

00:16:15.531 --> 00:16:20.561
instead of it costing me the equivalent of €20 to buy those pizzas

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:26.251
it would cost me €200, so I would probably feel a little bit silly.

00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:33.901
This isn’t just a theoretical situation, and the reason I used the example of two

00:16:33.901 --> 00:16:40.121
pizzas was because the first things that were ever bought with bitcoin were, two pizzas.

00:16:41.021 --> 00:16:47.561
A man on an internet forum offered someone 10,000 bitcoin to deliver him two pizzas.

00:16:48.691 --> 00:16:55.631
These 10,000 bitcoins were at the time worth around $42, but would be

00:16:55.631 --> 00:17:00.751
worth, at the time of recording this podcast, almost $200,000 dollars.

00:17:01.741 --> 00:17:07.301
Evidently, the fact that the bitcoin price moves up and down so much means

00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:13.361
that it’s not yet practical to be used to buy and sell anything at any date

00:17:13.391 --> 00:17:19.451
in the future - it’s only ever sort of practical to make purchases right now.

00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:24.981
So that’s why you might see places like Starbucks accepting

00:17:24.991 --> 00:17:29.941
bitcoin, but it’s not so common to see houses for sale in bitcoin.

00:17:30.492 --> 00:17:35.232
While some governments are embracing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, saying

00:17:35.442 --> 00:17:39.802
that they will be the future of money, others are trying to clamp down on them.

00:17:40.582 --> 00:17:45.742
Being in control of the money supply is a very important thing for any government,

00:17:46.162 --> 00:17:50.932
which means you can put money into the economy in the short term, for example

00:17:51.152 --> 00:17:54.632
if there’s a devastating pandemic and you need to stimulate the economy.

00:17:55.602 --> 00:18:00.992
If everyone in a country uses a currency that isn’t controlled by that country’s

00:18:01.002 --> 00:18:06.382
government, then the government can’t print money, it can’t easily raise money

00:18:06.382 --> 00:18:11.542
to pay for things, and that has got a lot of countries’ governments very scared.

00:18:12.772 --> 00:18:15.962
And the country that is perhaps the most scared of Bitcoin?

00:18:17.082 --> 00:18:18.102
The United States.

00:18:18.852 --> 00:18:22.812
The US is particularly afraid of what Bitcoin could become

00:18:23.042 --> 00:18:27.122
because the US has the world’s reserve currency, the dollar.

00:18:28.272 --> 00:18:33.402
The Federal Reserve controls the supply of the US dollar, and it just adds and

00:18:33.442 --> 00:18:38.322
adds to it every month, so there is more money for the US government to spend.

00:18:38.982 --> 00:18:44.702
It seems like magic, and it is a super useful tool for governments to be able to use.

00:18:45.392 --> 00:18:52.812
But if everyone used Bitcoin, this magical tool in a government’s toolbox just vanishes.

00:18:54.242 --> 00:19:00.042
There are all sorts of other reasons that some people love bitcoin, and other people hate

00:19:00.052 --> 00:19:06.032
it, and unfortunately we don’t have time to go into detail on each and every one today.

00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:11.942
But, to recap, for the die-hard proponents of bitcoin, the people who

00:19:12.202 --> 00:19:16.562
vehemently believe it will be the money of the future, the key reasons are:

00:19:17.492 --> 00:19:21.232
Firstly, that it means you are in control of your money,

00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:25.402
not a government or a bank, it can’t just be taken away.

00:19:26.472 --> 00:19:33.062
Secondly, that it is truly borderless, that you can send it to anyone, anytime, without

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:39.262
having to worry about currency exchanges or limits on where and when you can transfer money.

00:19:40.422 --> 00:19:44.662
And finally that it can’t be devalued in the same way

00:19:44.692 --> 00:19:48.452
that fiat currency can, that it will hold its value.

00:19:49.702 --> 00:19:55.572
And for those that think it’s a huge scam and should be stopped, the main reasons are:

00:19:56.182 --> 00:20:00.062
Firstly, that it has a troubled relationship with criminality.

00:20:01.112 --> 00:20:07.352
Because bitcoin is anonymous, and because it is easy to send to anywhere in

00:20:07.352 --> 00:20:12.932
the world at the click of a button it has been associated with transactions

00:20:12.952 --> 00:20:18.962
involving drugs, weapons, terrorism and all sorts of very nasty things.

00:20:20.422 --> 00:20:25.552
Secondly, because the price is so volatile the argument goes

00:20:25.692 --> 00:20:29.642
that it cannot ever be used as a true medium of exchange.

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:36.342
For a currency to be useful as a way of buying and selling stuff that currency’s

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:42.822
value has to be relatively stable, and bitcoin’s value is far from it.

00:20:44.132 --> 00:20:48.252
And thirdly, the ability to control the money supply is a

00:20:48.252 --> 00:20:51.622
hugely valuable thing for a government to be able to do.

00:20:52.592 --> 00:20:56.572
With bitcoin, it can’t do it and that’s scary.

00:20:57.912 --> 00:21:01.612
There is one thing that I’m sure both sides can agree on though.

00:21:02.382 --> 00:21:06.292
That the first two pizzas to ever be bought in bitcoin were

00:21:06.312 --> 00:21:10.342
probably the most expensive pizzas in the history of pizza delivery.

00:21:11.392 --> 00:21:12.662
And the worst thing about that?

00:21:13.342 --> 00:21:16.582
I’ve seen a picture of them and they don’t even look very nice.

00:21:19.302 --> 00:21:23.862
Ok then, that is it for the weird and wonderful world of bitcoin.

00:21:24.872 --> 00:21:29.042
It is very complicated, and we have only scratched the surface.

00:21:29.652 --> 00:21:34.412
But I hope that this has helped explain a bit about it, and some

00:21:34.452 --> 00:21:38.302
of the main reasons that some people love it and others hate it.

00:21:39.552 --> 00:21:44.832
At least now, when you see someone waxing lyrical on the news, when you see someone

00:21:45.122 --> 00:21:49.862
telling you why it’s the future, or you see someone else telling you that it is a

00:21:49.942 --> 00:21:55.012
massive fraud, then you’ll have a bit more of an idea about what they’re talking about.

00:21:55.792 --> 00:22:00.792
As a final reminder, if you are looking for a more interesting way to improve your

00:22:00.812 --> 00:22:06.762
English in 2021, then I’d recommend checking out becoming a member of Leonardo English.

00:22:07.032 --> 00:22:11.232
Not only does this mean you’ll get immediate access to all of our bonus

00:22:11.252 --> 00:22:16.072
episodes, and all of the fantastic learning materials that come with them, but

00:22:16.412 --> 00:22:21.532
I’ve managed to persuade the amazing Amy to give a one hour English strategy

00:22:21.532 --> 00:22:26.462
lesson to anyone who becomes an annual Learner member before the end of January.

00:22:27.072 --> 00:22:30.572
As I said at the start, Amy is in super high demand, so

00:22:30.732 --> 00:22:33.752
we have to limit this to the first 50 people to join.

00:22:34.612 --> 00:22:39.452
I guess these will go quite quickly, so if this is of interest, and it certainly

00:22:39.622 --> 00:22:44.422
would be if I were you, then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:22:45.682 --> 00:22:50.582

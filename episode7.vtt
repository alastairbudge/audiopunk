Alastair Budge: Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo

00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:08.506
English.

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:09.874
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:17.884
It's an exciting day to day because this is actually part one of our three-part mini series on who

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.794
owns the sea, the sky and space.

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:26.784
Before we get right into it though, I just wanted to remind you that you can grab a copy of the

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:31.404
transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast over on the website, which is

00:00:31.404 --> 00:00:33.654
www.leonardoenglish.com.

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:36.804
I'll put the links in the show notes as well.

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:45.909
Okay, so today we are going to be talking about the sea and who owns it and why that is important.

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:47.644
It's actually pretty interesting.

00:00:48.548 --> 00:00:54.524
Then in part two, we'll go onto who owns the sky, and in part three it's a space, the final

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:55.094
frontier.

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:59.714
So listen to all three parts and you'll know who owns almost everything.

00:01:00.378 --> 00:01:06.355
Well, the obvious thing we've missed out from the sea and space is the land.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.009
So let's start by quickly explaining that one.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:15.054
Who owns the land is actually quite a simple question, at least from the point of view of which

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:20.050
country owns which pieces of land There are 195 countries in the world.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.140
Well, 193 countries in the UN and two what's called observer countries, so that's the Holy See,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.400
which is the governing body of the Catholic church in the Vatican City.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.760
And the other is the state of Palestine.

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:40.425
So the ownership of the world's land, at least from a sovereign, from a country's point of view, is

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:42.615
divided between 195 countries.

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:49.155
There's one exception to this, which is Antarctica, which actually doesn't belong to anyone.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:51.435
More of that on another day though.

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:57.279
So who owns the land is quite a simple question from a sovereign point of view, it's the countries.

00:01:57.765 --> 00:01:59.934
But let's return to the question of the seas.

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:02.214
It's not quite so straightforward.

00:02:03.796 --> 00:02:10.499
As those of you who were paying attention in geography class will remember, the oceans cover 71% of

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:16.889
the earth's surface, so making sure that ownership is clear and enshrined in law is, well, it's a

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:18.329
pretty important thing to get right.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:25.529
The oceans are packed full of things that every country would love to have, from the obvious fact

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:31.439
that they are a source of food, to the fact that they contain trillions of dollars of oil, gas, and

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.179
other valuable natural resources.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:40.736
Plus from a geopolitical strategic point of view, control of a piece of the sea can come in pretty

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:41.156
handy.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:48.312
Understandably, it's a pretty complicated subject and it actually took almost 15 years of

00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:51.642
negotiations at the UN to agree on how this would work.

00:02:52.362 --> 00:02:59.022
So I hope you'll forgive me for glossing over parts of it, but in the next 10 minutes or so, we can

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:03.252
get a pretty good idea of how ownership of the sea actually works.

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:10.140
Historically, the oceans and seas were divided into two broad categories.

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:17.205
Firstly, what we would call coastal waters, which are the bits of water around the coast of the

00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:17.655
country.

00:03:18.391 --> 00:03:25.261
Then there were the high seas, which are every bit of sea further out than three miles from the

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:26.221
border of a country.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.879
Why three miles, you're wondering?

00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:35.494
Well, this was actually developed from something called the cannon shot rule in the early 18th

00:03:35.494 --> 00:03:36.004
century.

00:03:36.712 --> 00:03:43.329
So if a cannonball being fired from land could hit your ship, you were too close and you had gone

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.669
into the territorial waters of another country.

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:53.047
Given the fact that you were actually within range of a cannon, this was a pretty good incentive to

00:03:53.047 --> 00:03:55.387
not go into the waters of another country.

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:04.075
Outside of these three miles, this was considered to be international waters, so free to ships from

00:04:04.135 --> 00:04:08.005
any country, but not technically belonging to one country.

00:04:08.632 --> 00:04:14.676
This was before the discovery of deep sea oil or natural gas, and so the only concern was really

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:17.556
from a fishing, trade and military point of view.

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:25.596
Although this agreement worked in principle, there were some anomalies and to quote Pirates of the

00:04:25.596 --> 00:04:29.376
Caribbean, they were more like guidelines than rules.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.245
Several countries decided that they wanted to control more than three miles out from their

00:04:35.245 --> 00:04:38.440
coastline, and so they just declared that they did.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.280
So who owned the sea was a bit of a mess.

00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:46.703
Countries said that they own parts of it and there was no real consensus.

00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:52.938
There was also the obvious difficulty with a body of water, which is that it's not quite so easy to

00:04:53.388 --> 00:04:58.964
demarcate, to, to show, where a country's ownership starts and ends.

00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:05.627
Deciding how ownership of the sea should work was, to state the obvious, not an easy task.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.508
And evidently whatever the decision was about how ownership should work would favour some countries

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:15.458
and put others at a disadvantage.

00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:18.917
The sea is finite, so it's zero-sum.

00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:23.757
If one part of the sea is owned by one country, it means it can't be owned by another.

00:05:24.447 --> 00:05:25.917
But it had to be done, right?

00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:33.980
You couldn't have over two thirds of the world's surface area just sort of ignored from an ownership

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.520
point of view.

00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:41.052
So the gargantuan task of figuring this out fell to the UN, to the United Nations.

00:05:42.048 --> 00:05:48.478
They spent 15 years negotiating this, and the result was the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which

00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:49.918
was signed in 1982.

00:05:50.643 --> 00:05:54.079
This, dear listeners, is what tells us who owns the sea.

00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:58.543
It has now been signed by 167 states.

00:05:58.783 --> 00:06:04.543
You might think that this means almost everyone in the world has signed it and you'd sort of be

00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:09.094
right, but there's one big one missing the United States of America.

00:06:09.784 --> 00:06:16.078
Republicans in the Senate have refused to sign this bill, as they say, it undermines US sovereignty

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:23.066
and would open up the US to all sorts of environmental regulations that would put a big dent in

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:24.086
corporate profits.

00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:32.810
In short, it would force big oil companies to behave in a better way and behaving, well, it costs

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.070
money and hurts profits.

00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:41.916
As I mentioned, it took almost 15 years to negotiate this convention in the UN, so that must have

00:06:41.936 --> 00:06:44.066
been millions of man hours.

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:50.238
The UN isn't famous for keeping things simple, but I'll try and keep it as much to the point as we

00:06:50.238 --> 00:06:50.718
can here.

00:06:52.098 --> 00:07:01.420
Although the UN treaty splits the sea into six categories of territorial water, then one category of

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.814
international water, we can boil this down to three, really.

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:12.671
Firstly up to 12 nautical miles from the coastline, unless this impinges on the rights of another

00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:17.021
country, the country that borders the sea, in effect, owns it.

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:19.421
It can broadly do what it wants.

00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:25.817
Ships from other countries have the right to pass through, but they can only do what's defined as

00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:27.677
innocent passage.

00:07:28.217 --> 00:07:35.042
To translate this into plain English, it means that they can go through it, but they can't do things

00:07:35.042 --> 00:07:38.372
like fish or pollute or spy.

00:07:39.847 --> 00:07:46.037
Secondly, up to 200 nautical miles from the coast, this is called the exclusive economic zone.

00:07:46.878 --> 00:07:55.632
Within this area, a country owns the rights to resources of the sea, which includes fishing and oil

00:07:55.632 --> 00:07:57.012
and gas exploration.

00:07:57.682 --> 00:08:03.356
And again, so long as this doesn't impinge on the rights of another country, as long as it doesn't

00:08:03.746 --> 00:08:07.946
go so far as to to hit the territorial waters of another country.

00:08:09.142 --> 00:08:12.998
There's a third category though, and this is where it becomes pretty interesting.

00:08:13.615 --> 00:08:19.706
Before the UN convention, some countries, including the United States had defined their land

00:08:19.706 --> 00:08:26.225
territory as finishing at the continental shelf, while others defined it as finishing where the sea

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:26.765
started.

00:08:28.593 --> 00:08:35.311
The continental shelf is basically the piece of the continent which is submerged under the sea, but

00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:36.991
still part of the landmass.

00:08:38.093 --> 00:08:45.113
The convention decided that waters started at the coast, not at the end of the continental shelf,

00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:50.693
which meant that countries that had previously defined it as coming from the end of the continental

00:08:50.693 --> 00:08:57.173
shelf ended up with far less territory, so far less ownership of the sea than they previously

00:08:57.173 --> 00:08:57.923
claimed to have.

00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:01.045
Obviously they were not happy with that.

00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:07.144
To compromise, the UN created a third category, and that's for countries with wide continental

00:09:07.144 --> 00:09:07.564
shelves.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:15.626
The treaty stated that a continental shelf can extend up to 350 nautical miles from the coast, and

00:09:15.626 --> 00:09:22.166
so countries with large continental shelves got another 150 nautical miles of ocean territory

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:26.366
compared to those with continental shelves of less than 200 miles.

00:09:27.044 --> 00:09:34.945
So to recap, there are three broad categories of sea that is owned to a certain extent by a country.

00:09:35.494 --> 00:09:41.433
Firstly 12 nautical miles from the coast, the waters belonging to the country where the coast is

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:44.583
located, they have exclusive rights to everything.

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:51.223
Secondly, up to 200 nautical miles from the coast, the country has the rights to the waters'

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:54.703
resources oil, gas, fish, and so on.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:04.043
Thirdly, for countries with a wide continental shelf, these economic rights extend to up to 350

00:10:04.043 --> 00:10:05.663
nautical miles from the coast.

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:12.758
It's worth briefly talking about the impact of this continental shelf amendment, going from 200

00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:19.470
nautical miles to 350 nautical miles is pretty significant, you know, it's a 75% increase.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:27.254
The edge of the continental shelf also isn't always an exact science and since 1982 when the

00:10:27.254 --> 00:10:34.304
convention was ratified, various coastal nations have been scrambling to find geological evidence

00:10:34.516 --> 00:10:38.476
that their continental shelves extend to 350 nautical miles or more.

00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:44.972
This is particularly prevalent with countries around the North Pole where there is strong evidence

00:10:44.972 --> 00:10:49.807
to suggest that the seas and ice caps are full of oil and natural gas.

00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:56.287
Studies suggest that around 25% of the remaining oil and gas in the world is in the North Pole.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:03.974
If these countries can prove that their continental shelves extend out past 350 miles, then they can

00:11:03.974 --> 00:11:08.924
claim sovereignty over these waters and thus benefit from the drilling rights the territory.

00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:16.888
So I guess you may be wondering what happens when you go out further than 350 nautical miles, and

00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:22.281
when you get out past the territorial waters that are owned by countries, who owns this bit of the

00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:22.521
sea?

00:11:23.172 --> 00:11:27.638
Well, in short, nobody and everybody.

00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:33.208
They're called the high seas, international waters or in Latin 'Mare Liberum'.

00:11:33.972 --> 00:11:39.743
They form over two thirds of the ocean, so that's about 50% of the surface area of the world.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.997
Anyone can go here.

00:11:42.402 --> 00:11:48.582
Anyone is free to fish, lay pipelines or cables and conduct scientific research.

00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:51.569
You can do almost whatever you want.

00:11:51.929 --> 00:11:56.789
However, a ship has to abide by the laws of the country under which is flying.

00:11:57.704 --> 00:12:03.793
Unless you're engaged in criminal acts, so piracy being the classic criminal act committed at sea,

00:12:04.093 --> 00:12:09.607
you need only obey the laws of the country where the ship is registered, no matter where that is in

00:12:09.607 --> 00:12:10.147
the world.

00:12:10.657 --> 00:12:17.107
To give you an example, if a ship is flying the Maltese flag, the flag of Malta, and it is all the

00:12:17.107 --> 00:12:24.098
way down 500 miles off the coast of Japan, but still in international waters, then it has to abide

00:12:24.098 --> 00:12:30.458
by Maltese law, not Japanese, despite Japan being the country that the ship is closest to.

00:12:31.034 --> 00:12:36.457
And no, you can't just get round this law by not having the flag of any country.

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:42.882
If you do this, you are violating all maritime law and it also means that other ships could legally

00:12:42.882 --> 00:12:48.809
board you, to come onto your ship and claim jurisdiction over the ship so in general, it's not a

00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:49.259
good idea.

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:53.703
Okay, so that's a brief explanation of how the seas are divided.

00:12:54.003 --> 00:12:57.183
Let's have a little look at how this has affected geopolitics.

00:12:57.947 --> 00:13:04.397
One unintended impact of this Convention on the Law of the Sea is that it has led to some countries

00:13:04.887 --> 00:13:10.767
trying to claim sovereignty over islands and rocks that they had never previously expressed any real

00:13:10.767 --> 00:13:11.367
interest in.

00:13:12.304 --> 00:13:18.203
It's meant that various small pieces of uninhabited rock in the middle of nowhere have suddenly

00:13:18.203 --> 00:13:20.603
become of great strategic value.

00:13:21.948 --> 00:13:27.994
Nowhere is this more true than the islands in the East and South China seas, where there are several

00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:34.195
small islands with nothing of interest actually on them that have become political battlegrounds for

00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:35.965
countries in East Asia.

00:13:36.845 --> 00:13:43.051
You may have heard of islands called Diaoyu in Chinese or Senkaku in Japanese.

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:48.991
That's one dispute, and then there are the Spratley, Paracel and Scarborough Shoal islands in the

00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:55.445
South China Sea, which are claimed by a mixture of Brunei, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the

00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:57.035
Philippines and Vietnam.

00:13:58.111 --> 00:14:04.966
As you may now realise, the reason that sovereignty over these islands is so prized is that if a

00:14:04.966 --> 00:14:11.078
country can claim ownership over a piece of land, well then they gain ownership and the economic

00:14:11.078 --> 00:14:15.728
rights to the waters up to 350 nautical miles off the coast.

00:14:17.108 --> 00:14:22.208
In the case of these islands, there is no continental shelf to be claimed, but nevertheless, they

00:14:22.208 --> 00:14:28.148
can claim economic rights to the oceans for up to 200 nautical miles, including oil, gas, and

00:14:28.148 --> 00:14:34.172
fishing, and they get a foothold in, in the case of the South China Sea at least, one of the world's

00:14:34.202 --> 00:14:35.972
major shipping lanes.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:43.464
As you may know, these disputes are still unresolved, but it's not unlikely that they'll flare up

00:14:43.464 --> 00:14:44.214
again soon.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.959
If they do, you'll have a good idea why if you didn't already.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:54.971
I don't generally like to single out individuals in these kinds of huge global initiatives, but I

00:14:54.971 --> 00:15:01.399
think in this case, when talking about the laws of the sea, it's worth praising one particular

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:04.759
individual and for reasons that will become clear in a minute.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.103
He was half Maltese, half Swedish, and his name was Arvid Pardo.

00:15:11.383 --> 00:15:17.422
He lived a pretty extraordinary life, which we don't have the time to go into in great detail now,

00:15:17.741 --> 00:15:20.932
but here's a summary that I think gives you the measure of the man.

00:15:21.648 --> 00:15:27.186
He was orphaned at age nine, he joined the anti-fascist movement in Italy at the breakout of the

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:28.026
second world war.

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:31.956
Then he was captured and sentenced to death by the Gestapo.

00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:33.641
He was freed by the Russians.

00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:38.374
Then he arrived penniless in London and worked washing dishes in a restaurant.

00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:40.594
But that's not why I mentioned him.

00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:46.940
He was the architect of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and he worked

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.030
tirelessly to get this law passed.

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:57.964
After making an impassioned speech at the United Nations in 1967 he fought for 15 years to push this

00:15:57.964 --> 00:16:06.214
convention through the diplomatic treacle of the UN, and after 15 years of no doubt, incredibly

00:16:06.214 --> 00:16:11.316
frustrating negotiations in 1982 he finally saw his dream realised.

00:16:13.152 --> 00:16:19.725
To quote the late Kofi Annan, he did more than anyone of his generation to enlighten the world about

00:16:19.725 --> 00:16:22.785
what he called the common heritage of mankind".

00:16:24.331 --> 00:16:29.606
I'm of course, partial to him as he's half Maltese and Malta is the little rock in the Mediterranean

00:16:29.606 --> 00:16:30.806
where this podcast is made.

00:16:31.516 --> 00:16:37.336
I'd like to think that his Maltese heritage was something that made Pardo particularly aware of the

00:16:37.336 --> 00:16:43.486
need for an understanding and appreciation of the waters that form over two thirds of the surface of

00:16:43.486 --> 00:16:43.846
the planet.

00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:46.076
Okay.

00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:55.006
So that's who owns the sea and why it matters In part two of this three-part mini series we'll be

00:16:55.036 --> 00:17:01.366
looking up and talking about who owns the sky, before we move onto part three, look up even further

00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:02.686
and talk about space.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.037

00:17:11.489 --> 00:17:11.879
review.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:17.339
Every review warms my heart, and it's just great to see that the podcast is helping people.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:22.690
I just checked the other day and saw that we've had listeners from as far away as Peru, Mongolia,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.960
Cote d'Ivoire, and it's just great to see that it's having an impact.

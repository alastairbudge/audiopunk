Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:17.185   
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:22.421
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:27.393
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The American

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:32.453
Revolutionary War, or as it’s more often called, The American Revolution.

00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:39.623
This is the second part of this three part series on The Age of Revolution.

00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:44.423
In part one we talked about The Industrial Revolution, and in the

00:00:44.423 --> 00:00:48.723
next part, part three, we will talk about The French Revolution.

00:00:49.393 --> 00:00:54.533
And before that there was actually a related episode on The Enlightenment,

00:00:54.873 --> 00:00:58.863
without which perhaps none of these revolutions would have happened.

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:04.133
So, you can of course listen to all of these episodes individually, but

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:09.433
they are probably even more interesting as a trio, or even as a quartet.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:14.863
You might think it’s a bit strange to have someone from Britain talking

00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:18.783
about The American Revolution, because, well, it’s not something

00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:23.473
that people in Britain tend to talk about a lot, as the British lost.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:30.593
But it is a fascinating story, and for better or for worse, the American Revolution, and the

00:01:30.743 --> 00:01:37.983
subsequent creation of The United States of America, has had a global impact that is hard to match.

00:01:38.953 --> 00:01:43.893
It is a long and complicated story, so we will focus on the most interesting

00:01:43.893 --> 00:01:50.403
parts, and tell it through the formula of causes, course, and consequences.

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:55.273
So, why did it happen, what actually happened, and what

00:01:55.523 --> 00:01:59.603
has this meant for America, for Britain, and for the world.

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.793
OK then, let’s get stuck into it.

00:02:05.373 --> 00:02:10.493
Before we dive right into the causes of The American Revolution, let’s just

00:02:10.493 --> 00:02:15.293
remind ourselves of what was actually going on in the mid 18th century.

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:17.413
Firstly, America.

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:23.103
Now, America as a term, and as a concept, didn’t really exist.

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:28.433
The continent we now know as North America had been colonised by the

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:33.943
British, French and Spanish, starting with Christopher Columbus in 1492.

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:39.573
While the Spanish conquered most of what is now Mexico and the south of North

00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:46.438
America, the eastern and northern parts were colonised by French and British settlers.

00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:51.840
The French and the British got into some territorial disputes, there was the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.790
9 year French and Indian war, the British won, and the French handed control

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.090
of everything to the east of the river Mississippi over to the British.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.900
Meanwhile, in Europe, the French and the British had been fighting something

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.080
called the Seven Years War, which was a struggle for global domination, and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.178
sucked in countries such as Spain, Prussia, Russia, Portugal and Sweden.

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:28.078
The result was, technically at least, a British victory, but it left Britain with huge debts.

00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:31.738
Wars, as we all know, are expensive.

00:03:32.738 --> 00:03:36.608
In order to try to raise money to pay these debts,

00:03:36.908 --> 00:03:40.398
Britain looked to its colonies in America for money.

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:47.358
To clarify exactly which colonies we are talking about here, we’re talking about 13

00:03:47.398 --> 00:03:53.958
colonies on the eastern coast of what we now call The United States of America, so

00:03:53.958 --> 00:04:00.688
that's: Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania,

00:04:01.008 --> 00:04:07.698
Delaware, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.

00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:12.958
Now, who were the people actually living in these states?

00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:14.718
Were they Americans?

00:04:15.448 --> 00:04:17.578
Well, yes and no.

00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:20.348
Yes, because they lived in America.

00:04:20.618 --> 00:04:26.078
But no, because the vast majority of them were relatively recent

00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:31.128
immigrants from Europe, and they were still technically British citizens.

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:38.058
85% of the immigrant population came from Great Britain, which included Ireland at the

00:04:38.058 --> 00:04:44.998
time, but there were also lots of people from countries like the Netherlands and Germany.

00:04:45.978 --> 00:04:52.038
Although the 13 colonies were mainly made up of immigrants from Europe, there were

00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:59.438
other significant populations – about 250,000 slaves, transported barbarically from

00:04:59.478 --> 00:05:05.568
Africa, who worked on the cotton, rice, and tobacco plantations of the southern states.

00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:11.618
And there were the tribes of the Native Americans whose unhappy story

00:05:11.648 --> 00:05:16.958
of gradual submission to the colonists is a sad story for another time.

00:05:17.838 --> 00:05:23.198
Other European nations will feature too in our story – German mercenaries on the

00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:28.298
British side and, as is so often the case with anything involving the British

00:05:28.318 --> 00:05:33.498
military adventures abroad, this won’t be the last time we’ll hear from the French.

00:05:34.528 --> 00:05:40.058
So, that’s the context, what then were some of the immediate causes

00:05:40.088 --> 00:05:44.138
that brought about the start of the American Revolutionary war?

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.448
As ever, it is a combination of underlying, background factors and immediate sparks

00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:59.108
which lit the blaze and caused the outbreak of hostilities, caused the fighting to start.

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:07.038
The most significant underlying cause was the deteriorating relationship between Britain and

00:06:07.038 --> 00:06:13.908
its fast-growing, increasingly prosperous, increasingly rich, and independent-minded colonies.

00:06:14.878 --> 00:06:18.658
Let’s use the image or metaphor of a family.

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:24.568
One could say that this is a bit like the natural development of any fast-growing,

00:06:24.818 --> 00:06:29.568
independent-minded teenager who seeks independence from their parents.

00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:35.318
In the end they need their own space and to be able to run their own lives.

00:06:36.018 --> 00:06:41.058
However, there was nothing inevitable about the initial rebellion.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:47.908
In 1763 Britain was broke, it had large debts, after financing

00:06:47.908 --> 00:06:52.228
the war in North America as well as the Seven Years War in Europe.

00:06:52.928 --> 00:06:58.218
The British colonies in North America were prosperous, they were doing well economically,

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:04.708
and King George III of Britain decided to raise taxes on the 13 colonies, which

00:07:04.808 --> 00:07:10.278
had relied heavily on the military support of Britain in the French and Indian War.

00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:18.168
The raising of taxes wasn’t in itself the problem, but rather the way in which it was done.

00:07:19.128 --> 00:07:24.118
There was a well established principle in British law that you should not be

00:07:24.118 --> 00:07:30.968
taxed unless you are democratically represented in government, but these 13

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:35.978
British colonies in America had no representation in the British parliament.

00:07:36.508 --> 00:07:39.688
They simply had to do whatever was decided in

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:43.288
Westminster, in the Houses of Parliament back in London.

00:07:44.268 --> 00:07:49.878
Starting in 1765, the British imposed taxes on the British

00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:54.118
colonies in America, and these were deeply unpopular.

00:07:55.228 --> 00:08:02.968
The first large tax, called The Stamp Act, required British colonists to pay taxes on

00:08:02.968 --> 00:08:09.198
stamps on a whole range of things, from official documents through to playing cards.

00:08:09.988 --> 00:08:17.388
Before long, there was a popular movement against this tax, with the slogan “no taxation without

00:08:17.388 --> 00:08:23.438
representation”, meaning you couldn’t be taxed if you weren’t represented democratically.

00:08:24.235 --> 00:08:29.478
There was an increasing anti-British feeling, with people boycotting

00:08:29.488 --> 00:08:34.538
British goods, not buying British goods, and some small-scale protests.

00:08:35.768 --> 00:08:43.098
It wasn’t for another five years though, not until 1770, that things really came to a head.

00:08:44.008 --> 00:08:50.328
The Boston Massacre was when British soldiers shot and killed five protestors,

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:56.838
and then three years later, in 1773, again in Boston, there was the Boston

00:08:56.868 --> 00:09:03.198
Tea Party, when volunteer American soldiers dressed as native Americans, went

00:09:03.288 --> 00:09:09.858
onto British ships in the Boston harbour and threw the precious tea overboard.

00:09:10.788 --> 00:09:17.678
Britain sent soldiers to Boston to control the situation, but tensions continued to grow.

00:09:18.168 --> 00:09:23.078
The American colonists started to arm themselves, they started to

00:09:23.078 --> 00:09:27.898
form small armies, in anticipation of the conflict that was to come.

00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:36.578
Then, in a place called Lexington, in Massachusetts on 19 April 1775, the

00:09:36.578 --> 00:09:41.798
real fighting broke out, with the so-called “shot heard around the world”.

00:09:42.638 --> 00:09:47.068
It was a full-blown battle between British soldiers and the

00:09:47.258 --> 00:09:52.458
Massachusetts militia, and resulted in the death of over a hundred men.

00:09:53.208 --> 00:09:56.978
Britain was now at war with its American colonies.

00:09:57.978 --> 00:10:03.198
Now, I said earlier that there was nothing inevitable about the revolution.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:09.388
This was because the natural tendency of so many of the colonists was to have

00:10:09.388 --> 00:10:15.098
considerable loyalty towards the mother nation, which had after all protected

00:10:15.098 --> 00:10:20.768
them and, through victory in the recent war, it had won them the opportunity

00:10:20.768 --> 00:10:26.928
to expand West into lands that were previously under the control of the French.

00:10:27.978 --> 00:10:31.268
A number of the founding fathers of The United States had

00:10:31.268 --> 00:10:35.598
spent time in England as a way of completing their education.

00:10:35.788 --> 00:10:38.978
They had very strong family links with Britain.

00:10:39.978 --> 00:10:45.718
Most importantly, perhaps, the people who led the revolution, such as Thomas Jefferson,

00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:52.358
Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Madison and George Washington, they were prosperous, successful

00:10:52.358 --> 00:10:58.568
men who had many reasons to want to keep the status quo - or things being as they were.

00:10:59.718 --> 00:11:03.258
In so many ways they were unusual revolutionaries.

00:11:03.848 --> 00:11:09.718
Through rebelling and being traitors to their mother country they risked everything.

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:17.066
So it is not surprising that there were powerful ideals that united them and drove

00:11:17.086 --> 00:11:24.206
them on, not only to rebel, but also to design the system of government or constitution

00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:30.026
of the new United States that was based on a very distinctive set of beliefs.

00:11:31.136 --> 00:11:36.266
Here it is perhaps helpful to revisit some of the ideas of the

00:11:36.266 --> 00:11:39.966
European Enlightenment from the episode on The Enlightenment.

00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:46.236
Key figures in the American revolution, such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson,

00:11:46.566 --> 00:11:52.376
were profoundly influenced by Enlightenment thinking and also by the writings and

00:11:52.386 --> 00:11:57.416
actions of the thought leaders of the English Revolution [or the English Civil

00:11:57.436 --> 00:12:03.286
War], such as John Milton, who worked closely with the English republican leader,

00:12:03.426 --> 00:12:09.326
Oliver Cromwell and who is best known for his famous epic poem, Paradise Lost.

00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:16.606
Of even more importance and immediate impact was a pamphlet, a short

00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:23.866
document, of a mere 47 pages that was published in 1775 by an Englishman

00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:29.131
called Thomas Paine, who had only just recently emigrated to Pennsylvania.

00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:34.181
This anecdote is a fascinating insight into how a

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:38.313
small book can have a dramatic impact on world history.

00:12:39.463 --> 00:12:45.423
Paine’s pamphlet, which is called Common Sense, was written in the simplest of

00:12:45.463 --> 00:12:51.443
English with the desire that it should reach a very broad audience and that it could

00:12:51.453 --> 00:12:58.063
also be listened to by everyone when it was published in Pennsylvania early in 1775.

00:12:59.103 --> 00:13:00.423
It was a sensation.

00:13:00.813 --> 00:13:05.603
It is estimated that almost half of the 2.5 million people

00:13:05.613 --> 00:13:10.343
living in the colonies would have either read or listened to it.

00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:17.193
This means that it still holds the record for being read or heard by a higher

00:13:17.223 --> 00:13:21.863
proportion of the population of the United States than any other publication.

00:13:22.754 --> 00:13:28.279
In this work, Paine demolishes the arguments in favour of trying

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:32.049
to remain under British sovereignty or under British control.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.779
Perhaps his greatest achievement is to paint a vivid picture of what an

00:13:38.839 --> 00:13:44.559
independent, republican United States could be like, ruled by themselves

00:13:44.599 --> 00:13:50.349
and through elected representatives, elected annually, elected every year.

00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:56.259
This sensational and brave piece of work was instrumental in

00:13:56.629 --> 00:14:01.479
galvanising – or setting in motion – a process of rebellion.

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:07.649
Have a look, even if you just read the first few paragraphs, it really is quite

00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:13.179
inspiring, and is written in an English I'm sure you will be able to understand.

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:16.659
It also has such a modern feel to it.

00:14:17.179 --> 00:14:23.189
For example, when the author gets particularly excited or wants to stress

00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:29.389
something, he “shouts'' in capital letters, so, he tells us, do do not mistake

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:35.869
King George III [“the sullen-tempered Pharaoh of England”] as someone noble and

00:14:35.869 --> 00:14:42.679
powerful, “ an ASS FOR A LION” (An ass for a lion is all in capital letters).

00:14:43.659 --> 00:14:48.679
You can appreciate how so many of the words used in such a pamphlet,

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:53.019
which would have become a common reference point as the revolution

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:58.419
gathered pace would have had a powerful sound bite quality to them.

00:14:59.112 --> 00:15:03.712
For example, it is, he argues, “very absurd“ to think

00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:08.022
“a continent to be perpetually governed by an island.”

00:15:08.872 --> 00:15:14.932
Even reading it now, it is easy to get fired up, and I’m from the country that lost this war.

00:15:15.962 --> 00:15:20.972
And perhaps an even more inspiring document was one that was to come a few

00:15:20.972 --> 00:15:27.432
months later, on the fourth of July of 1776, The Declaration of Independence.

00:15:28.432 --> 00:15:34.992
This stated, amongst other more important things such as that the United States was an independent

00:15:35.012 --> 00:15:41.792
country, it stated that “all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:48.762
certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

00:15:49.572 --> 00:15:50.902
Quite inspiring, right?

00:15:51.542 --> 00:15:58.942
But it is an important and sobering reminder of this bold statement‘s limitations that the

00:15:58.982 --> 00:16:06.932
Declaration had no reference to the slave trade; in fact, the version originally drafted by Thomas

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:14.742
Jefferson had a clause which condemned the slave trade; sadly this was removed in order to secure

00:16:14.742 --> 00:16:21.412
the agreement of the southern colonies, where the economy relied so much on this inhuman practice.

00:16:22.242 --> 00:16:27.882
Now, moving onto what actually happened during the American Revolutionary War.

00:16:28.942 --> 00:16:34.432
So, by 1776 Britain was at war with its American colonies.

00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:41.082
It was a slightly strange situation, because the divisions between who was fighting

00:16:41.082 --> 00:16:46.052
for Britain, and who was fighting for America weren’t completely clear - there

00:16:46.052 --> 00:16:51.122
were Englishmen, like Thomas Paine, who had only been living in America for two

00:16:51.122 --> 00:16:56.342
years before becoming a fierce believer in revolution, and backer of independence.

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:59.562
And there were plenty of what we could consider

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:03.142
Americans, who fought on the side of the British army.

00:17:03.962 --> 00:17:08.612
Not everyone on the American side was looking for independence from Britain,

00:17:08.882 --> 00:17:14.212
and indeed before independence was declared, the colonies had simply proposed

00:17:14.222 --> 00:17:19.092
to put down their arms in exchange for the British reducing the taxes.

00:17:19.642 --> 00:17:22.942
But King George III, the King of Britain, refused.

00:17:23.652 --> 00:17:27.252
In terms of the people involved, the standing armies of

00:17:27.302 --> 00:17:31.532
both sides were relatively small, fewer than 50,000 men.

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:39.032
At its peak, the British had 22,000 British soldiers as well as 25,000 what’s

00:17:39.032 --> 00:17:44.282
called loyalists, so Americans who were loyal to Britain and fought for the British.

00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:49.802
There were also another 30,000 or so German mercenaries,

00:17:49.942 --> 00:17:52.702
soldiers who were paid to fight for the British.

00:17:53.462 --> 00:17:55.722
And let’s not forget the slaves.

00:17:55.912 --> 00:18:00.652
The British, out of self-interest I should add, offered freedom

00:18:00.652 --> 00:18:04.902
to slaves who worked on their opponents’ plantations, meaning that

00:18:04.912 --> 00:18:10.912
somewhere between 25-50,000 black slaves served with the British army.

00:18:11.952 --> 00:18:17.802
All in all, the soldiers fighting for the British numbered almost 150,000.

00:18:18.642 --> 00:18:25.162
Meanwhile, the colonists' army was smaller, no more than 48,000 men at any one time.

00:18:26.312 --> 00:18:30.822
It was, at the start at least, not a professional army, they weren’t

00:18:30.882 --> 00:18:35.542
professional soldiers, and for the first years of the war they suffered

00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:40.852
several heavy defeats against the better trained and better armed British army.

00:18:41.812 --> 00:18:48.192
The leader of the American army, a man called George Washington who was later to become the

00:18:48.192 --> 00:18:54.432
first president of The United States of course, he realised this, and he enlisted the help

00:18:54.502 --> 00:19:00.902
of Prussian soldiers to train his army, to turn his amateur soldiers into professionals.

00:19:01.712 --> 00:19:07.612
The Prussians arrived in the winter of 1777 and turned the American army

00:19:07.692 --> 00:19:12.482
from a group of untrained amateurs into a force to be reckoned with.

00:19:13.312 --> 00:19:19.512
Now, we have skipped over a lot of the details of the battles and fighting, but it

00:19:19.512 --> 00:19:25.952
can be summarised as relatively small battles not involving vast numbers of soldiers.

00:19:26.042 --> 00:19:29.862
The British had some early success, as did the Americans.

00:19:30.882 --> 00:19:38.222
By 1778 though, despite the improvements that the American army had made, the British looked like

00:19:38.222 --> 00:19:44.542
they had the upper hand, and that they were on the cusp of victory, they were about to win the war.

00:19:45.392 --> 00:19:50.312
In order to prevent its archrival Britain from this great victory,

00:19:50.702 --> 00:19:55.382
France decided to enter the war, joining forces with the Americans,

00:19:55.652 --> 00:20:00.722
providing considerable money, troops and a fleet of over 100 ships.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.504
Now, one can see why the French decided to enter the war - to stop Britain.

00:20:07.104 --> 00:20:11.234
Yet when we think of what was to happen in France just 10 years

00:20:11.234 --> 00:20:16.124
later, it does seem like a slightly foolish decision for the French

00:20:16.154 --> 00:20:20.794
king to support a movement to seek independence from a central ruler.

00:20:21.544 --> 00:20:28.604
No doubt Louis XVI was so convinced of his own power and god-given right to rule that the

00:20:28.604 --> 00:20:34.444
idea that his own people might try a similar thing in France didn’t even cross his mind.

00:20:35.474 --> 00:20:40.444
We should also not forget the Spanish, who joined the French in 1779,

00:20:40.684 --> 00:20:45.314
who hoped to regain territory that they had lost in America, and

00:20:45.564 --> 00:20:49.824
to regain the territories of Menorca and Gibraltar back in Europe.

00:20:50.909 --> 00:20:55.024
Were it not for the entry of France, and to a lesser extent,

00:20:55.044 --> 00:20:58.784
Spain, there is little doubt Britain would have won the war.

00:20:59.484 --> 00:21:03.754
And who knows how the world might have been different if that had happened.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:09.644
But France and Spain did join the war, and there was no way back for the British.

00:21:10.654 --> 00:21:18.634
On September 3, 1783, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which ended the war and acknowledged

00:21:18.764 --> 00:21:24.294
the existence of the United States of America as a free and independent country.

00:21:25.424 --> 00:21:32.114
Although the entirety of this story, with its idealism, bloodshed, vivid and various

00:21:32.144 --> 00:21:38.544
characters, is gripping – enthralling and exciting – perhaps the most intriguing

00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:44.084
part of the whole story lies in the consequences of the American revolution.

00:21:45.074 --> 00:21:49.144
I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that these

00:21:49.184 --> 00:21:53.364
consequences have affected virtually every country in the world.

00:21:54.324 --> 00:22:00.184
Firstly, and perhaps obviously, the American Revolution resulted in the foundation

00:22:00.214 --> 00:22:04.944
of the United States of America, with its emphasis on its ground-breaking

00:22:05.334 --> 00:22:10.234
founding ideals and in particular on its distinctive civil liberties.

00:22:11.174 --> 00:22:15.934
Secondly, at the heart of its foundation was a written constitution

00:22:16.354 --> 00:22:21.204
which had at its core the revolutionary principle that the government

00:22:21.234 --> 00:22:25.144
derives its “just powers from the consent of the governed”.

00:22:26.104 --> 00:22:30.774
This, the world‘s first written constitution, has provided

00:22:30.954 --> 00:22:33.934
the model for so many other countries’ constitutions.

00:22:34.694 --> 00:22:41.114
Similarly the process of throwing off colonial rule and abandoning the old model

00:22:41.114 --> 00:22:46.484
of rule by a monarch and a hereditary aristocracy - meaning people who simply

00:22:46.484 --> 00:22:51.444
were born into the ruling class - this was an inspiration to other countries.

00:22:52.654 --> 00:22:58.514
Comparable revolutions followed in places as diverse as Latin America, France of

00:22:58.514 --> 00:23:04.754
course, and especially in the 19th and early 20th centuries, across old Europe.

00:23:05.569 --> 00:23:10.624
Unsurprisingly, when you listen to part three of this mini-series, the one on

00:23:10.624 --> 00:23:15.297
the French Revolution, you will find many echoes of the American one in it.

00:23:16.285 --> 00:23:21.617
Finally, there is one other consequence which is perhaps a little more controversial.

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:29.597
It has to do with the idea of the new America as a symbol of human aspiration and idealism.

00:23:30.657 --> 00:23:36.647
Remember that the country was originally settled by people fleeing religious persecution

00:23:36.647 --> 00:23:42.397
in Europe and seeking greater control over their own lives and freedom from interference.

00:23:42.907 --> 00:23:49.357
This thread in American culture has, I think, continued with the country‘s tradition of immigration.

00:23:50.237 --> 00:23:53.817
Tom Paine calls it “an asylum for mankind”.

00:23:54.334 --> 00:23:59.484
As is famously written in the poem on the Statue of Liberty which would’ve

00:23:59.484 --> 00:24:04.464
greeted many millions of immigrants arriving by ship in New York, “Give

00:24:04.464 --> 00:24:10.374
me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…“

00:24:11.234 --> 00:24:16.054
The combination of all these factors has made the United States of America

00:24:16.284 --> 00:24:21.114
a source of continued fascination and interest for the rest of the world.

00:24:21.884 --> 00:24:28.074
This has been particularly evident during the final three months of the Trump presidency when

00:24:28.304 --> 00:24:34.924
so many of those founding ideals and the strength of the American constitution have been put

00:24:34.964 --> 00:24:41.584
under such severe pressure and have generated both scrutiny and anxiety around the world.

00:24:42.694 --> 00:24:48.684
For many people, it can seem strange that Americans have such a fascination, and

00:24:49.074 --> 00:24:54.534
almost cult-like obsession with the founding fathers of the country, with the

00:24:54.694 --> 00:25:00.134
idea that everything in the constitution is almost holy and must be preserved.

00:25:01.264 --> 00:25:05.884
But with a knowledge of the unlikely story of the American Revolution,

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:10.304
it becomes much easier to understand some of the reasons why.

00:25:13.164 --> 00:25:17.754
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The American Revolution.

00:25:18.114 --> 00:25:21.114
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new,

00:25:21.264 --> 00:25:25.824
and that you feel like you now have a slightly better understanding of

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:30.184
the history of a country that has an influence on every single one of us.

00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:34.584
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:25:34.854 --> 00:25:38.824
We actually have quite a few members who live in America, so I would

00:25:38.824 --> 00:25:42.604
be particularly interested to know what you thought of this episode.

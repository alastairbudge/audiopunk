Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.549
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:21.060
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.850
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three, our final part,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.180
of our three-part mini-series on British children’s authors.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.910
In case you missed them, in part one, we looked at the unusual

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.680
life of Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.980
In part two, which was one of our member-only ones, we looked at the divisive but hugely

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.779
successful Enid Blyton, the author best known for stories like The Famous Five and Noddy.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.740
And today, in part three, we’ll finish this mini-series by exploring the amazing life of Roald Dahl.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.199
You might know him as the author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.320
Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach, but you might not know

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.399
that he was a war hero, a spy, and even a friend of the President.

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:17.379
OK then, the magical life of Roald Dahl.

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:23.889
“I had climbed into my new Gladiator [aeroplane] at an RAF airfield.

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.879
This was going to be my very first venture into combat territory.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.181
The flight  in itself was a fairly daunting one for

00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:36.231
someone who had virtually no experience of the aircraft.

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:40.921
It is not a particularly tricky business if you have had plenty of

00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:45.831
practice, but if you are new to the game […] it is a dicey, experience.

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:51.551
I flew straight for the point where the 80 Squadron airfield should have been.

00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:53.031
It wasn’t there.

00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:58.011
Below me there was nothing but empty desert, and rather

00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:02.671
rugged desert at that, full of large stones and boulders.

00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:09.261
At this point, dusk began to fall and I realised that I was in trouble.

00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:14.561
My fuel was running low and there was no way I could get back.

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.941
The only course open to me now was to make a forced landing in

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:22.951
the desert and make it quickly, before it was too dark to see.

00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:30.781
I chose a piece of ground that seemed to me to be as boulder-free as any and I made an approach.

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.941
I prayed for a bit of luck.

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:34.301
I didn’t get it.

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:40.271
My undercarriage hit a boulder and collapsed completely and the [plane] buried

00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:45.321
its nose in the sand at what must have been about seventy-five miles an hour.

00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:50.121
I was unconscious for some moments, but I must have recovered my senses very

00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:57.041
quickly because I can remember hearing a mighty whoosh as the petrol tank exploded.

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:02.061
I could see nothing at all, and I felt no pain.

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:08.001
All I wanted was to go gently off to sleep and to hell with the flames.

00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:12.411
I heard my machine-gun ammunition exploding in the flames

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.641
and the bullets were pinging about all over the place.

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:22.611
I began very very slowly to drag myself away from the awful hotness.

00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:27.291
In the end the temperature all around me became bearable.

00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:31.501
When that happened I collapsed and went to sleep.”

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:36.261
This is Roald Dahl’s account of his terrible crash when he

00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:39.641
was a 24-year-old fighter pilot in the Second World War.

00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:46.481
Aside from almost killing Dahl and leaving him with a long four-month recovery in

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:53.501
hospital, this experience was a fundamental step that led to his amazing literary career.

00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.541
So how exactly did this happen?

00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:03.591
How did Dahl, a boy born in Wales to Norwegian parents, end up in the African desert?

00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:09.071
And how did he go from crashing a fighter plane during the war to becoming

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.871
one of the most successful and beloved British children’s authors of all time?

00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:19.951
He was born in 1916, and his childhood was filled with

00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:24.621
a mixture of mischief, of being naughty, and of tragedy.

00:04:25.821 --> 00:04:29.188
Both his father and sister died when he was very

00:04:29.188 --> 00:04:32.728
young, and he was bullied and beaten badly at school.

00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:39.568
But he was a great prankster, someone who enjoyed playing practical jokes.

00:04:40.248 --> 00:04:43.838
Most famously, as he recounted in his childhood memoirs,

00:04:44.058 --> 00:04:49.318
Boy, he found a dead mouse and hid it inside a jar of sweets.

00:04:50.048 --> 00:04:54.238
And he also claimed to have swapped his half-sister’s fiancé’s

00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:59.308
tobacco for goat poo, another incident which he describes in Boy.

00:05:00.668 --> 00:05:06.528
After finishing school in 1934, the 18-year-old Dahl decided that he

00:05:06.528 --> 00:05:11.358
wanted adventure, he wanted a career which would allow him to travel.

00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:18.014
He wanted to see “wonderful faraway places like Africa and China” as he would put it.

00:05:18.854 --> 00:05:24.994
So, he applied for an apprenticeship at the oil company Shell, and after training

00:05:25.054 --> 00:05:30.744
for 2 years in England, he left on his long voyage to Tanzania in East Africa.

00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:35.754
And here he had many experiences that would no doubt have

00:05:35.854 --> 00:05:39.534
thrilled this adventure-seeking, mischievous, young man.

00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:47.264
For instance, one day Dahl spotted a black mamba, a deadly snake racing towards his

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:52.744
friend and he could only manage to escape just in time by killing it with a rake.

00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:59.524
On another occasion, Dahl witnessed a lion carrying off an old lady in its mouth.

00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:04.144
Miraculously she was saved and survived unharmed.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:12.744
But these exotic adventures would soon stop when in 1939 the Second World War broke out.

00:06:14.004 --> 00:06:18.684
Dahl decided he wanted to join the Air Force and within a year he had

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:23.764
completed his training and was based at the 80 Squadron in North Africa.

00:06:24.774 --> 00:06:29.405
And it was during his mission to deliver a new aircraft to his Squadron that

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:33.735
he suffered the shocking crash you heard about a few minutes ago, a crash

00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:39.705
which fractured his skull, shattered his nose, and temporarily blinded him.

00:06:40.915 --> 00:06:44.695
After a long recovery, and keen to be back in action,

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:48.645
Dahl went back to the Air Force and continued fighting.

00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:55.605
But his time as a pilot was not to last, as he started experiencing terrible headaches

00:06:55.765 --> 00:07:01.685
and would often black out and lose consciousness - likely because of his past injuries.

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:07.615
Soon, he was sent back home to Britain and unable to participate

00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:13.405
in action any longer, he found himself in a new diplomatic role.

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:20.895
By April of 1942 at the age of 26, Dahl found himself across

00:07:20.925 --> 00:07:24.485
the Atlantic at the British Embassy in Washington D.C.

00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:31.425
Although he enjoyed his time in America, he did not enjoy his new job and

00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:36.115
felt like it was unimportant compared to his hands-on action in Africa.

00:07:37.005 --> 00:07:42.535
His time in America would, however, be important for his future literary career.

00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:49.185
It was during his time in Washington that he met the famous British military writer C.S.

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:54.675
Forester, who heard about Dahl’s plane crash and wanted him to write about it.

00:07:56.155 --> 00:08:00.515
Forester believed that Dahl’s story could help gain some American

00:08:00.515 --> 00:08:05.825
support for the British war effort, so Dahl agreed to write his account.

00:08:07.025 --> 00:08:11.801
He reportedly wrote it in only 5 hours, and it was a dramatic

00:08:12.051 --> 00:08:16.751
masterpiece, clearly demonstrating the young Dahl’s writing talents.

00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:25.271
The story was titled ‘Shot Down Over Libya’, despite the fact that he hadn't actually been

00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:32.365
shot down and actually he had run out of fuel, but Forester suggested a dramatic title.

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:36.965
The article was published in The Saturday Evening Post.

00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:42.315
It was Dahl’s first published piece, but it was a wonderful piece of writing.

00:08:43.305 --> 00:08:49.184
Although it would be this article that would jumpstart his literary career, behind the

00:08:49.184 --> 00:08:55.794
scenes Roald Dahl was also taking on another role, one which he is less well-known for.

00:08:57.275 --> 00:09:04.435
To the world, he was a mere embassy employee, but it’s now thought that he had been enlisted

00:09:04.455 --> 00:09:12.135
by the Canadian spymaster William Stephenson and he became an undercover agent, a spy.

00:09:13.262 --> 00:09:19.609
Dahl’s role was to supply Britain with intelligence about its ally, the USA.

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:27.009
Britain needed to maintain American support for the its war effort in Europe, and Dahl’s

00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:32.439
role was to keep track of any anti-British sentiment within the American government.

00:09:33.849 --> 00:09:39.279
As you might imagine, this led to Dahl making some friends in pretty high places,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.695
in other words, he met many people in important and high up positions in society.

00:09:46.025 --> 00:09:50.215
Dahl even worked alongside the fellow spy Ian Fleming,

00:09:50.475 --> 00:09:53.145
who would go on to write the James Bond series.

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:59.685
But perhaps his most surprising friendship was with the American president Franklin D.

00:09:59.685 --> 00:10:00.155
Roosevelt.

00:10:00.938 --> 00:10:04.088
Dahl got to know the family quite well and he even

00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:07.808
sent them a copy of his very first work, The Gremlins.

00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:13.662
This was published in 1943, and was Dahl’s first children’s book.

00:10:14.702 --> 00:10:19.992
The book’s main character is a pilot, a fighter pilot, whose plane is shot down.

00:10:20.682 --> 00:10:24.422
The pilot then joins forces with these magical creatures,

00:10:24.672 --> 00:10:28.850
“gremlins”, to fight against a common enemy, Hitler and the Nazis.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:35.180
Interestingly enough, The Gremlins was originally intended to be a Disney movie.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:41.260
Walt Disney heard about Dahl’s idea, thought the story would make a great film, so he

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:47.650
gave Dahl a team of illustrators to work with to transform his gremlins into an animation.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.280
However, as time went on, there were copyright issues, and

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.558
Disney’s interest in the project began to fade, it waned.

00:10:57.247 --> 00:11:00.530
Instead of becoming a film the project was ultimately

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.820
published as a book, and a very popular one at that.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.540
And this really set off Dahl’s writing career.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.280
Initially, he wrote predominantly adult fiction, not children’s books.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.500
By the early 1960s, however, Roald Dahl’s focus had switched to writing

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.498
children’s books, and he would be best known as a children’s author.

00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:31.211
First came James and the Giant Peach in 1961, and he continued to write

00:11:31.271 --> 00:11:36.781
critically acclaimed children’s books and poetry right up until his death in 1990.

00:11:37.798 --> 00:11:43.988
I’m sure you’ll have read some of these, or perhaps you’ll have seen movie or TV adaptations.

00:11:44.898 --> 00:11:49.258
The fascinating thing is that, when you learn more about Roald Dahl’s

00:11:49.258 --> 00:11:53.768
life, or if you read more about his life in his memoirs, you can

00:11:53.768 --> 00:11:58.778
start to imagine how and why he created the magical worlds he did.

00:11:59.688 --> 00:12:05.862
As you heard, he was born to Norwegian parents and many of his books suggest the influence

00:12:05.862 --> 00:12:11.952
of Norwegian fairy tales, with their magic, witches and other mythical creatures.

00:12:12.862 --> 00:12:17.572
For example, The Big Friendly Giant and James and the Giant Peach both

00:12:17.582 --> 00:12:22.639
feature characters quite like the large trolls in many Norwegian stories.

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:26.479
Parts of Dahl’s The Witches are even set in Norway.

00:12:27.374 --> 00:12:34.811
Dahl was also, clearly, a naughty and mischievous boy, and he tells stories of this in his memoirs.

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:40.911
In his autobiography Boy, Dahl recounts one story from when he was

00:12:40.911 --> 00:12:45.121
just 8 years old, the one I alluded to at the start of the episode.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:51.731
Dahl and some friends had grown tired of what he called the “mean and

00:12:51.751 --> 00:12:56.281
loathsome” Mrs Pratchett, the lady who owned the local sweet shop.

00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:01.601
Dahl described Pratchett as an “old hag” who “never

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:06.071
smiled”, and one day the boys decided to take their revenge.

00:13:06.891 --> 00:13:11.331
So, having lifted a loose floorboard to discover a dead mouse in their

00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:16.455
classroom, the boys decided to sneak it into one of Pratchett’s jars of sweets.

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:21.646
The boys carried out their plan perfectly, celebrating

00:13:21.646 --> 00:13:24.676
the fact that the woman would suffer a great shock.

00:13:25.776 --> 00:13:29.809
However, the boys soon received a shock themselves when they discovered

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:33.739
Pratchett was at their school making sure that they would receive the

00:13:33.739 --> 00:13:38.239
cane, the stick that would be used to punish children for misbehaviour.

00:13:39.289 --> 00:13:42.179
Dahl would later write about this experience, describing

00:13:42.189 --> 00:13:45.769
the cane as “a red-hot poker against my flesh.”

00:13:47.239 --> 00:13:52.939
And Dahl’s negative experiences with adults have clearly left their mark on his work.

00:13:53.559 --> 00:13:59.319
We can see them in Miss Trunchbull from Matilda, and in the Child Catcher, which

00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:05.249
Dahl invented when writing the screenplay for the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

00:14:06.609 --> 00:14:11.629
On a less rosy note, you can also see Dahl’s personal tragedies

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:14.539
throughout his life clearly coming out in his writing.

00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:20.969
As you heard at the start of the episode, when he was just three years old Dahl lost his

00:14:20.979 --> 00:14:27.719
father and sister to illness, and later in life health disasters would hit his family again.

00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:35.179
In 1960, when his young son, Theo, was only 4 months old, the boy

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:40.389
suffered a terrible accident when his pram was hit by a taxi in New York.

00:14:41.469 --> 00:14:45.519
The boy’s skull was shattered and he suffered brain damage

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:49.259
so severe that doctors were unsure he would survive.

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:57.899
Miraculously though, he did survive but he developed something called hydrocephalus, a build-up of

00:14:57.899 --> 00:15:04.129
fluid on the brain which had to be drained frequently through a valve that was fitted to his skull.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.900
However, Theo’s valve was very unreliable and would often block, leading to

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.640
a buildup of fluid and the danger of serious further injury, and even death.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.790
So, Dahl decided to take matters into his own hands.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:28.190
He called upon two friends, Stanley Wade, an engineer, and Kenneth Till, a neurosurgeon.

00:15:29.379 --> 00:15:34.649
Together the group developed a brand-new valve for people suffering like his son.

00:15:35.599 --> 00:15:40.155
It worked, it saved Theo’s life, and this invention would go

00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:43.065
on to save the lives of thousands of children around the world.

00:15:44.795 --> 00:15:49.205
If you remember Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, there are all sorts of amazing

00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:54.435
devices, machines, and unusual contraptions that produce different chocolates.

00:15:55.785 --> 00:16:00.075
Given that this book was written shortly after he was working on developing

00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:03.892
his son’s medical device, it’s been suggested that this was part of

00:16:04.075 --> 00:16:07.835
the inspiration for the details of Willy Wonka’ chocolate factory.

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:14.821
But this almost fatal accident for his son would not be the last family tragedy for Dahl.

00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:20.945
While pregnant with their fifth child, Dahl’s wife suffered a series of strokes.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:27.175
Thankfully their baby survived but his wife, the American actress

00:16:27.245 --> 00:16:31.805
Patricia Neal, was left partially paralysed and struggling to speak.

00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:35.865
Her recovery was a long and slow process.

00:16:36.785 --> 00:16:42.095
Often, she would forget the names of objects and would invent new ones, for

00:16:42.095 --> 00:16:47.865
instance, she called a drink a “sooty swatch” and a cigarette an “oblogon”.

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:55.325
But, ever the person to turn misfortune into something playful, his wife’s new

00:16:55.325 --> 00:17:00.095
language caught Dahl’s attention and he began to play around with words, too.

00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:06.105
This is most evident in his 1982 book The Big Friendly Giant, for which

00:17:06.105 --> 00:17:09.825
he created the language ‘Gobblefunk’ which is spoken by the giant.

00:17:11.015 --> 00:17:15.875
And this inventive language has become one of his most defining features.

00:17:16.655 --> 00:17:22.165
Although he doesn’t always explain his new words, children understand them through

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:27.475
rhymes or onomatopoeia, words that literally sound like what they describe.

00:17:28.675 --> 00:17:34.355
I read Roald Dahl to my young son, and while he clearly doesn’t understand all the words,

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:41.185
especially because some aren’t real words, he absolutely loves the sounds, and hundreds of millions

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:47.055
of other children have felt exactly the same joy in listening to and reading Dahl’s stories.

00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:51.395
He was, simply put, a fantastic storyteller.

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:56.245
Clearly, many characters and parts of his books were inspired

00:17:56.255 --> 00:18:00.355
by people from his childhood or his own lived experiences.

00:18:01.225 --> 00:18:04.915
In James and the Giant Peach, James lives with two aunts

00:18:04.945 --> 00:18:08.885
who resemble the nasty Mrs Pratchett from Dahl’s childhood.

00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:15.885
And the whole story is alive with the type of magic familiar to Dahl through Norwegian fairy tales.

00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:22.285
Another strong theme throughout Dahl’s memoirs is an obsession with sweets.

00:18:23.205 --> 00:18:28.715
Not only is there the incident of the mouse at the sweet shop, but he would also recount how

00:18:28.715 --> 00:18:35.105
the chocolate company Cadbury sent packages to his school for the children to taste test.

00:18:35.925 --> 00:18:39.875
One would certainly imagine that he drew on these memories when writing

00:18:39.975 --> 00:18:43.455
perhaps his most famous creation, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

00:18:44.515 --> 00:18:49.145
Clearly, Roald Dahl had a rare talent for taking these lived

00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:53.985
experiences and turning them into amazing characters and narratives.

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:58.945
His own children would recount how their father would tell them amazing

00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:04.425
bedtime stories, inventing new characters and plot twists every single night.

00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:10.540
He was evidently an amazingly gifted storyteller, but when it came to

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.970
working, to actually writing his books, he took this very seriously.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:22.240
Dahl worked to a strict schedule in a shed in his garden, where he sat in an

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:27.404
armchair with the curtains closed surrounded by pencils, coffee and cigarettes.

00:19:28.374 --> 00:19:33.084
In fact, there’s an amazing video you can find on YouTube where he talks about

00:19:33.114 --> 00:19:38.434
his writing environment, and how the shed hasn’t been cleaned for 5 years.

00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:45.664
No matter the unpretentious office, his output was, as you will know, phenomenal.

00:19:46.204 --> 00:19:50.514
He is one of the best loved children’s authors of all time, and

00:19:50.634 --> 00:19:54.804
his books have sold over 250 million copies around the world.

00:19:55.984 --> 00:20:00.269
If you’ve read any Roald Dahl, which I certainly hope you will do if you

00:20:00.269 --> 00:20:03.959
haven’t done so already, you will probably know why he is so popular.

00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:10.419
He reminds us of the power of stories, the wonder of childhood, the joy of

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:15.859
our imagination, and of the huge happiness that magic and fantasy can bring.

00:20:16.859 --> 00:20:22.609
As he famously once wrote, “a little magic can take you a long way”

00:20:24.339 --> 00:20:30.019
Ok then, that is it for today’s episode on Roald Dahl, and with it comes

00:20:30.019 --> 00:20:33.789
the end of our three-part mini-series on British children’s authors.

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:39.719
As a reminder, in case you missed them, part one was on Lewis Carroll, of Alice in

00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:45.889
Wonderland fame, and part two was on Enid Blyton, who despite perhaps being less loved

00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:51.099
than either Lewis Carroll or Roald Dahl, in fact sold a lot more books than either of them.

00:20:51.949 --> 00:20:54.799
The final thing to say is that I would certainly encourage

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:58.439
you, as an English learner, to pick up some of these books.

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:02.629
Children’s books can be a great learning resource, the language is

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:07.099
simpler, they’re funny and short, so pick one up and give it a go.

00:21:07.989 --> 00:21:13.149
As always I would love to know what you thought of this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.979
Who are your favourite children’s authors?

00:21:16.379 --> 00:21:20.141
Have you read any Lewis Carroll, Enid Blyton or Roald Dahl?

00:21:20.601 --> 00:21:23.561
Are you planning to do so after listening to this mini-series?

00:21:23.861 --> 00:21:27.251
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

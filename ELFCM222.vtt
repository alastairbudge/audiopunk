Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.343 --> 00:00:16.853
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:21.043
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:27.733
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our four-part mini-series on gangsters

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:33.053
and robbers, violent criminals who have managed to capture the public’s attention.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.833
In Part One, we talked about The Real Peaky Blinders and the

00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:42.293
criminals of the late 19th century and early 20th century Birmingham.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:48.223
Then in Part Two we talked about Al Capone, the Italian-American

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:52.353
prohibition era gangster and leader of the Chicago Outfit.

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:58.033
In Part Four we will talk about The Kray Twins, a pair of identical

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:03.363
twins who terrorised London’s East End in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:01:03.943 --> 00:01:09.463
And in today’s episode, part three, we will be talking about the notorious gangster

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:16.213
and bank robber, the man called by the FBI “Public Enemy Number One”, John Dillinger.

00:01:19.027 --> 00:01:21.757
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:31.339
Our story starts with the arrival of a small boy, John Herbert Dillinger, on June 23rd of 1903,

00:01:31.557 --> 00:01:37.835
in Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana, in the north east of the United States of America.

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:41.855
His parents were honest, middle class Americans.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:47.634
His father was a hardworking grocer, but a harsh, strict man

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:51.422
who would often beat the young Dillinger if he misbehaved.

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:56.902
Tragically, Dillinger’s mother died when her son was just 3 years old.

00:01:57.482 --> 00:02:03.263
His father remarried six years later, but the young boy hated his new stepmother.

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:11.193
Dillinger was, by all reports, very clever and charismatic but a bit of a cheeky boy.

00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:17.361
He would play tricks on other people, and this soon turned into forming a small gang.

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.339
The young boys wouldn’t do anything terrible, they would

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.369
play pranks and tricks on people in the neighbourhood.

00:02:25.382 --> 00:02:28.839
Dillinger thought this was a lot more fun than sitting in a classroom,

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.479
and he dropped out of school aged 16, getting a job in a metal workshop.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.419
However, he started to stay out all night, and this worried his father.

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.295
He thought that the big city, and the friends his son was making

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:50.675
in the city, were a bad influence on his teenage son, and that this

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:55.655
small-time mischief would lead young John’s life down a dangerous path.

00:02:56.073 --> 00:03:01.546
So, he moved the family out of Indianapolis, buying a farm in the

00:03:01.566 --> 00:03:06.506
countryside outside a small town called Mooresville, hoping that if the

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:11.326
boy were removed from temptation he would manage to stay out of trouble.

00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:13.586
Well, he was wrong.

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:17.666
Dillinger continued to get into trouble, and before

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:22.006
long this turned from naughty tricks to literal crime.

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:28.426
In 1922, when he was 19 years old, he was arrested for car theft.

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:33.336
In order to avoid going to prison, and to try to get his

00:03:33.336 --> 00:03:37.566
life back on track, his father pushed him towards the navy.

00:03:38.566 --> 00:03:45.218
In 1923 he was assigned to a warship, but within a few months he had run away.

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:51.518
His main duties involved shovelling coal into a large furnace deep in the

00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:56.178
belly of the ship, and Dillinger, well, he had bigger plans than that.

00:03:57.088 --> 00:04:02.738
After being dishonourably discharged from the navy, in effect sacked

00:04:02.738 --> 00:04:06.538
from the navy, he returned to the small town his father had moved to,

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:12.458
Mooresville, where he met a 16-year-old girl, fell in love and married.

00:04:13.158 --> 00:04:17.768
His father must have no doubt been happy because - perhaps this was what

00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:22.888
the then 20-year-old John Dilliger needed to get his life back on track.

00:04:23.718 --> 00:04:28.778
He did, reportedly, try to live an honest life for several months, but

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:34.118
struggled to find a job or anything resembling a normal rhythm to life.

00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:43.038
He joined a baseball team, but it was there that he met a former convict named Ed Singleton, who

00:04:43.038 --> 00:04:49.248
was to prove to have been a worse influence than anyone Dillinger had ever met in Indianapolis.

00:04:50.118 --> 00:04:53.388
They were drinking together one night when Singleton

00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:57.988
told Dillinger about a grocery store run by an old man.

00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:04.469
Singleton told Dillinger that the old man would be going home after a trip to the barbers,

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:10.018
and would have all of the money the shop had made on him, he would be carrying it.

00:05:10.908 --> 00:05:16.318
Given that the man was old and would struggle to defend himself, it would be easy money.

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:21.788
The plan was that Dillinger would go up to the old grocer and rob

00:05:21.808 --> 00:05:25.568
him, while Singleton would be waiting in a car down the street.

00:05:26.428 --> 00:05:28.408
It sounded like a decent plan to Dillinger.

00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:36.508
He got ready for the robbery, taking a pistol and a large machine bolt, essentially a large piece of

00:05:36.508 --> 00:05:43.168
metal machinery, with which he planned to hit the grocer over the head and run off with the money.

00:05:44.148 --> 00:05:49.388
It’s not clear exactly what happened on that day, and there are differing

00:05:49.408 --> 00:05:54.608
statements about the sequence of events, but it’s thought that when Dillinger

00:05:54.658 --> 00:06:00.108
approached the man, he turned round and confronted him, Dillinger fired his

00:06:00.108 --> 00:06:05.198
gun and then ran away, thinking he had shot and killed the elderly grocer.

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:08.588
In fact, he hadn’t, and the man survived.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:12.578
Dillinger ran down the road towards Singleton’s getaway car,

00:06:13.028 --> 00:06:17.128
but Singleton was nowhere to be seen, he had driven away.

00:06:17.838 --> 00:06:21.628
Both Dillinger and Singleton were seen by eye-witnesses,

00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:23.998
and they were quickly arrested by the police.

00:06:24.868 --> 00:06:28.958
After his arrest his father asked the local prosecutor

00:06:29.198 --> 00:06:33.058
what the best approach was to minimise his son’s sentence.

00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:39.108
This local prosecutor advised Dillinger’s father that, given his son didn’t

00:06:39.128 --> 00:06:44.563
have a criminal record, if he pleaded guilty, if he said he was guilty of

00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:50.748
the crimes, then he would be given a lenient, a forgiving, a short sentence.

00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:54.518
Essentially, he would not have to spend a long time in prison.

00:06:55.561 --> 00:06:59.528
Dillinger’s father persuaded his son to plead guilty,

00:07:00.128 --> 00:07:03.238
and as a result he thought he didn’t need a lawyer.

00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:09.558
The prosecutor had either been incredibly stupid or had tricked Dillinger’s father.

00:07:10.418 --> 00:07:16.868
After he entered his guilty plea he was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison.

00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:24.139
The judge had decided to make an example out of the young Dillinger and give him a harsh sentence.

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:29.097
Singleton, on the other hand, pleaded not guilty, he said he

00:07:29.097 --> 00:07:33.267
didn’t do anything, but he retained the services of a lawyer.

00:07:34.137 --> 00:07:38.757
Despite the fact that Singleton already had a criminal record, he was

00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:44.207
given only two to fourteen years, of which he ended up serving only two.

00:07:45.157 --> 00:07:49.737
Aged 21, Dillinger was thrown into Indiana State Prison, and

00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:54.623
would remain incarcerated, would remain locked up for 9 years.

00:07:55.153 --> 00:07:59.613
From the moment he entered prison, he was angry, reportedly saying

00:08:00.133 --> 00:08:05.033
"I will be the meanest bastard you ever saw when I get out of here".

00:08:06.773 --> 00:08:10.083
While in prison, he was popular with his other inmates.

00:08:10.653 --> 00:08:14.523
He was a skilled worker, and would often do the work of his

00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:18.130
fellow inmates, which understandably made him some friends.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:25.440
The friends he made were, for the most part, seasoned criminals, and it was during his time in

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.000
prison that Dilllinger learned the ropes, he got an apprenticeship in the career of bank robbing.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:38.910
Robbing a bank successfully, Dillinger found out, was a lot more complicated than walking

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:44.680
into a bank, pointing a gun at someone, and holding out a bag for them to put money into.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.880
Dillinger and his friends studied bank robbing techniques that had

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.920
been pioneered by an ex-Prussian army officer called Herman Lamm.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:59.980
Lamm’s techniques involved meticulous, very careful planning.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.970
You would study a bank carefully, make maps, make detailed plans, everyone

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.990
involved in the robbery would have a specific task and have to stick to it.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:18.370
It really was a military operation, Dillinger soon became an expert

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.980
in the theory of bank robbing, and he planned to put his theories

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.283
into practice with his new prison friends as soon as they got out.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.637
When he was eventually released on parole, in 1933 after eight and a half

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.330
years locked up, he found America in the middle of the Great Depression.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:45.860
Even if Dillinger had wanted a normal job and normal life, it was very difficult to find work

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:51.740
for anyone, let alone someone who had spent the best part of the last 10 years in prison.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.350
So, as you might imagine, Dillinger returned to a life of crime.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.600
He first robbed a bank in Ohio, but was arrested shortly

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.660
after and put in jail, where he was to await trial.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.780
Just on a linguistic note, “jail” and “prison” are often

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.910
used interchangeably but there is an important difference.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.970
“Jail” is the place where suspected criminals are held before they are sentenced

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.780
or where people convicted of minor crimes are held, and a “prison” is the

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.120
place where more serious criminals are held after they have been sentenced.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.180
So, Dillinger was in jail, awaiting trial.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:42.890
When he had been arrested, police had searched his pockets and found a map that looked

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:48.190
like it was a map of a prison, it looked like it was a plan for a prison escape.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.370
Dillinger claimed he didn’t know anything about it, but then just

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:58.940
four days later his old friends from his previous prison escaped using

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.040
exactly the same plans that had been found in Dillinger’s pocket.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:08.730
A few days later, some men came to the jail where Dillinger was being kept.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.060
They told the sheriff that they were prison officers and they had

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.860
come to return Dillinger to Indiana State Prison, the prison where

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.160
he had been serving his sentence for the robbery of the grocer.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.300
When the sheriff asked to see proof that these men were who they said

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:31.130
they were, one of the men pulled out a gun and shot the sheriff dead.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.470
Of course, they weren’t prison officers, they were Dillinger’s friends

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.810
from prison who had come to save him, now ready to rob some banks together.

00:11:41.607 --> 00:11:47.107
Let’s just pause for a moment to remind ourselves of John Dillinger’s life so far.

00:11:47.627 --> 00:11:53.007
His mother had died before he was four, his father was a violent bully, he

00:11:53.007 --> 00:11:57.995
had fallen in with a bad crowd and then tried his luck at being a sailor.

00:11:58.915 --> 00:12:02.565
When that didn’t work out he tried his first robbery, and was caught.

00:12:02.925 --> 00:12:05.625
This was all before his 21st birthday.

00:12:06.445 --> 00:12:12.345
He then spent almost 9 years in prison where he met some of the most professional

00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:17.324
bank robbers in America, and was released in the middle of the Great Depression.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:21.994
What’s more, his young wife had divorced him while he was in prison.

00:12:23.363 --> 00:12:27.333
Then, he was broken out of jail while he was awaiting his sentence.

00:12:27.923 --> 00:12:34.143
He was now “on the run” from the police, and if he were caught again he might easily spend

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:39.833
another 10 or more years in prison, not getting out before his 40th birthday at best.

00:12:40.693 --> 00:12:46.713
Dillinger and his gang got to work robbing banks, first robbing police arsenals,

00:12:47.073 --> 00:12:52.203
stores of police weapons and armour, where they managed to steal machine guns,

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:57.653
bullets, and bulletproof vests - the bank robber’s starter kit, you might say.

00:12:58.363 --> 00:13:03.963
They moved around the country frequently, but as their fame grew they had to

00:13:03.963 --> 00:13:09.473
be more and more careful - the police knew their identities, their pictures

00:13:09.673 --> 00:13:14.273
had been printed in the newspapers, and they were far from anonymous.

00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:21.847
They found this out the hard way when they were staying in a hotel in Arizona in January of 1934.

00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:27.133
A fire broke out in the hotel they were staying in, and the firemen

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:31.303
who came to put out the fire recognised the men from their photos.

00:13:32.093 --> 00:13:36.193
The police were called, and Dillinger and his men were arrested.

00:13:37.213 --> 00:13:42.323
Now facing long jail sentences, and perhaps even the death sentence for the

00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:47.313
murder of the sheriff, things weren’t looking good for Dillinger and his gang.

00:13:48.123 --> 00:13:54.535
However, Dillinger was not only an intelligent and resourceful man, but he was also very

00:13:54.535 --> 00:14:00.785
talented with his hands - remember he spent time working in a metal workshop as a teenager.

00:14:01.655 --> 00:14:08.765
He managed to get a piece of wood and whittle it down, sculpt it down to the shape of a gun.

00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:14.815
He then painted this fake wooden gun black, and when the time was

00:14:14.815 --> 00:14:20.190
right he jumped on one of the guards and pointed this fake gun at him.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:26.910
The guards believed it was real, then opened up the cell door, and Dillinger

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.780
and his men managed to escape, taking with them the guards’ weapons.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.760
Now, up to this point only local police had been involved.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:44.210
Dillinger’s crimes were state-level crimes, not federal crimes, so the FBI, or

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:49.350
what was then simply called the Bureau of Investigation, hadn’t been involved.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:56.010
Dillinger’s mistake was to steal a car and drive it across the Indiana-Illinois

00:14:56.010 --> 00:15:00.790
border, the border between the state of Indiana and the state of Illinois.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:08.060
And with that simple act he had committed a federal crime, a national crime.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:15.690
He likely didn’t know this, but it’s a federal offense to transport a stolen motor vehicle across

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:21.550
state lines, and this meant that the federal government could now get involved in the chase.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.400
This was bad news for Dillinger.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.140
The last thing you want as a bank robber is the FBI on your tail.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.860
Several of Dillinger’s fellow gang members were caught by the police.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.090
Dillinger, however, was not.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.620
He teamed up with new criminals, and his crime spree continued,

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:47.460
terrorising banks across the American midwest from 1933 to 1934.

00:15:48.238 --> 00:15:52.787
There was a strange public interest in the robberies that his gang were committing.

00:15:53.227 --> 00:15:58.567
They would make front-page news, and there was a lot of interest in the techniques

00:15:58.567 --> 00:16:04.347
that the robbers had actually used, including reportedly posing as a salesperson

00:16:04.357 --> 00:16:08.517
for an alarm company, so they could get access to the vault, through to

00:16:08.747 --> 00:16:14.417
pretending to be a film crew looking for locations for a movie about bank robbers.

00:16:15.657 --> 00:16:20.977
.
Dillinger’s reputation grew, and he became a sort of Robin Hood figure in the public eye.

00:16:21.517 --> 00:16:24.977
Remember, we are right in the middle of the Great Depression here.

00:16:25.317 --> 00:16:32.097
People blamed the banks for the situation, and a man who was robbing from the banks, especially

00:16:32.097 --> 00:16:37.837
one as photogenic and reportedly as charismatic as Dillinger, was someone to be admired.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:45.402
The FBI, I should add, had refuted this image of Dillinger as a Robin Hood

00:16:45.442 --> 00:16:50.822
character, writing that he was a violent criminal whose only motive was getting rich.

00:16:51.592 --> 00:16:55.392
Now, returning to our story, by this time Dillinger

00:16:55.402 --> 00:16:59.067
had a new girlfriend, a lady called  Evelyn Frechette.

00:16:59.707 --> 00:17:04.958
She wasn’t actively involved with the bank robberies, but they travelled everywhere together.

00:17:05.568 --> 00:17:11.738
On multiple occasions police officers almost caught them, turning up at apartments

00:17:11.908 --> 00:17:17.178
they had rented with fake names, but they were either too late or Dillinger and

00:17:17.178 --> 00:17:21.248
Frechette managed to escape in the nick of time, just before being captured.

00:17:22.138 --> 00:17:28.768
By the summer of 1934, after multiple close shaves, multiple close encounters

00:17:28.768 --> 00:17:33.748
with the police, with his face all over the newspapers and being named “Public

00:17:33.798 --> 00:17:39.098
Enemy Number One” by the FBI, Dillinger decided it was time for a change.

00:17:39.648 --> 00:17:44.588
It wasn’t time to stop robbing banks, certainly not, it was time to change himself.

00:17:45.488 --> 00:17:52.998
He had tried to dye his hair a different colour and grow a moustache, but he was still recognisable.

00:17:53.518 --> 00:18:00.728
He underwent amateur plastic surgery to change his appearance, and when he re-emerged he went

00:18:00.728 --> 00:18:06.794
by the name of Jimmy Lawrence, in an attempt to avoid being recognised as John Dillinger.

00:18:07.575 --> 00:18:15.157
On June 30th of 1934, remember this is still only just after a year after he was released from

00:18:15.157 --> 00:18:21.832
prison on parole, he committed his last bank robbery, in which a police officer was shot and killed.

00:18:22.652 --> 00:18:30.522
By this time  Dillinger’s gang had robbed 12 separate banks, stolen $300,000, which

00:18:30.722 --> 00:18:36.752
is today’s equivalent of around $6 million, and killed 10 people in the process.

00:18:37.592 --> 00:18:43.412
Less than a month after his last robbery, police received a call from a lady

00:18:43.502 --> 00:18:48.452
called Anna Sage who said she had information about Dillinger’s whereabouts.

00:18:49.342 --> 00:18:54.212
She was an immigrant from Romania, whose real name was Ana Cumpănaș,

00:18:54.272 --> 00:18:59.082
and had been forced to work as a prostitute for a Chicago mob boss.

00:18:59.802 --> 00:19:04.302
She was now a madam, she ran a brothel, but she had

00:19:04.312 --> 00:19:07.582
got on the wrong side of the US immigration service.

00:19:08.332 --> 00:19:13.742
Long story short, she was going to be kicked out of the country, and she thought that

00:19:13.772 --> 00:19:18.842
if she could help the authorities get Dillinger then she would be allowed to stay.

00:19:19.662 --> 00:19:23.992
It’s not completely clear how Dillinger knew Cumpănaș, or

00:19:24.052 --> 00:19:27.832
Sage, but it’s thought that Dillinger’s girlfriend knew her.

00:19:28.532 --> 00:19:34.862
Anyway, Dillinger trusted Cumpănaș, and it was this trust that was to be his downfall.

00:19:35.452 --> 00:19:38.489
Cumpănaș struck a deal with the FBI.

00:19:38.898 --> 00:19:44.475
She told them that she, Dillinger and Dillinger’s girlfriend would be going to see a movie.

00:19:45.075 --> 00:19:50.050
She would wear an orange dress, so that the police could recognise her.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.880
When they saw her, they would find Dillinger, they would be together.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.640
Sure enough, Cumpănaș, Dillinger and his girlfriend turned up at the movie theatre.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:09.400
As they were leaving, the lead FBI agent, a man named Melvin Purvis looked Dillinger in the eye.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.030
He had finally found the most wanted bank robber in America.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.690
Purvis lit a cigar, which was the prearranged signal to

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.070
show his colleagues that Dillinger had been identified.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:30.463
Dillinger realised something was going on, he pulled out a gun and started to run, but not

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:37.235
before three FBI officers had managed to shoot him three times, killing him almost instantly.

00:20:37.795 --> 00:20:44.375
As he lay outside on the street, blood streaming from his head, onlookers reportedly pushed

00:20:44.385 --> 00:20:51.015
forward and put their handkerchiefs in his blood, that was the extent of how famous Dillinger was.

00:20:51.755 --> 00:20:57.365
And that was it, not much more than 13 months after it really started,

00:20:57.585 --> 00:21:02.855
the bank robbing career and life of America’s most wanted man was over.

00:21:03.585 --> 00:21:10.155
His successful capture by the FBI is thought to have been the one case that really catapulted

00:21:10.155 --> 00:21:16.885
the organisation to nationwide fame, to be an organisation that was deeply feared by criminals.

00:21:17.635 --> 00:21:23.365
Without Dillinger to lead it, the bank robbing gang was no more, and

00:21:23.525 --> 00:21:28.335
according to the FBI’s official website “The events of that sultry July

00:21:28.335 --> 00:21:33.205
night in Chicago marked the beginning of the end of the Gangster Era”.

00:21:33.985 --> 00:21:39.745
When it comes to the legacy of Dillinger himself, if this story was somewhat familiar to you it’s

00:21:39.985 --> 00:21:46.755
probably because you have seen the 2009 film “Public Enemies” with Johnny Depp, where Dillinger

00:21:46.865 --> 00:21:53.275
is portrayed as a charismatic but troubled man, which doesn't seem to be too far from the truth.

00:21:55.225 --> 00:22:00.195
Like all of the other characters we’ll encounter in this series, there’s no doubt that

00:22:00.475 --> 00:22:06.425
Dillinger was a criminal, a danger to society, and probably not a very nice man at all.

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:13.645
But, if one has to compare him to Al Capone, the Peaky Blinders, or even to the Kray

00:22:13.655 --> 00:22:18.975
Twins, who we will meet in the next episode, he seems a little bit less dangerous.

00:22:19.385 --> 00:22:23.325
Yes, he was a bankrobber, yes, he was probably also a

00:22:23.335 --> 00:22:27.495
murderer, but there was a certain element of Robin Hood to him.

00:22:28.025 --> 00:22:32.985
He might not have given money back to the poor, and there might not have been any noble

00:22:32.995 --> 00:22:40.495
aim to his robbery, but the fact that so many people in 1930s America felt cheated by the

00:22:40.495 --> 00:22:46.875
entire financial system meant that to many, Dillinger’s crimes weren’t really crimes at all.

00:22:49.105 --> 00:22:54.951
OK then, that is it for today’s episode on John Dillinger, Part Three

00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:59.611
of our four-part series on 20th century gangsters and criminals.

00:23:00.091 --> 00:23:05.051
As a reminder, in part one we heard about The Peaky Blinders, part

00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:09.971
two was Al Capone, and next up, part four will be on The Kray Twins.

00:23:10.461 --> 00:23:13.231
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:23:13.231 --> 00:23:16.231
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:23:16.621 --> 00:23:22.521
How do you think John Dillinger compares to The Peaky Blinders, Al Capone and The Kray Twins?

00:23:23.121 --> 00:23:25.821
Better, worse, or just different?

00:23:26.101 --> 00:23:27.441
I would love to know.

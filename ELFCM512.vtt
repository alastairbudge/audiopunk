Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.485
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:20.825
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:26.115
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about gold.

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:31.155
And more specifically, the gold standard, the system during

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:35.745
which paper money was directly convertible to physical gold.

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:41.005
If you have never heard of this before, it might seem strange, an unusual

00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:45.875
system, but it was an incredibly important part of economic history.

00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:52.675
So, in this episode, we’ll talk about where it came from, how it worked, its advantages and

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:59.785
disadvantages, why it was eventually abandoned, and why some people are now calling for its return.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:06.405
OK then, let’s not waste another minute, and get talking about the gold standard.

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:15.315
If you watched Donald Duck cartoons as a child, you might remember Donald’s uncle, Scrooge McDuck.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:20.235
He is an extremely rich duck and spends his days

00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:24.425
thinking about his money and ways he can make more of it.

00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:31.400
All of his money is kept in “The Money Bin”, and one of Scrooge McDuck’s

00:01:31.403 --> 00:01:37.645
favourite things to do is to dive into his huge stash of gold coins.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:42.035
It is a symbol of extreme wealth - everyone watching it

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:46.615
immediately recognises that this means he is a rich man.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.865
But, why?

00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:52.197
Why is gold seen as a symbol of wealth?

00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:55.027
And how did it come to be so valuable?

00:01:56.217 --> 00:02:01.757
The simplistic answer is “It looks pretty and is shiny”, and this is of

00:02:01.757 --> 00:02:07.217
course true, but there are some nuances to this, some additional factors.

00:02:08.477 --> 00:02:15.563
Firstly, the value of something tends to be linked to how rare it is and how hard it is to get.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.733
Gold can be found all over the world.

00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:24.353
The problem is that getting gold out of the ground is difficult and expensive.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:30.413
So that’s the first thing: it’s difficult to get, therefore it is relatively rare.

00:02:31.413 --> 00:02:35.553
Secondly, it's incredibly malleable, meaning that you

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:38.743
can bend it and change its shape without breaking it.

00:02:39.313 --> 00:02:44.473
You can melt it down and create something new with it, and the gold will work just as well.

00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:50.983
Thirdly, and helped by the previous reason, you can make beautiful things

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:57.233
with it, shiny jewellery, crowns, and other decorative items that look nice.

00:02:57.963 --> 00:03:02.623
Because it was found all over the world, and humans aren’t so different,

00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:08.003
it was seen as an attractive metal by societies everywhere, from the

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:13.353
Ancient Egyptians to the Aztecs, Ancient Greece to Mali in West Africa.

00:03:14.543 --> 00:03:18.703
And although it is very malleable, it can bend and be

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:23.003
moulded into new shapes, it is an incredibly resistant metal.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.903
It doesn’t corrode, it doesn’t get damaged, it doesn’t rust.

00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:31.923
It is almost as if, if you were going to design an element that had

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:37.493
the perfect properties to be used as a type of money, gold would be it.

00:03:38.873 --> 00:03:45.763
And, as you may know, gold has been used as a form of money since ancient times,

00:03:46.053 --> 00:03:53.673
with the first recorded gold coin coming from Lydia, in modern-day Turkey, in 600 BC.

00:03:54.753 --> 00:04:00.153
Cities and countries started to mint their own gold coins, producing

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:04.438
their own currency for use both domestically and with other states.

00:04:05.938 --> 00:04:12.238
And the good thing about using gold as money was that two different civilisations—whether they

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:18.468
spoke different languages or had different customs—could trade their gold coins with one another.

00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:22.098
The coins might have been different, they had a different person’s

00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:26.159
head on them and they might have been a different shape, but they

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:32.089
both contained a certain amount of gold, so they had intrinsic value.

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:39.069
It was this combination of factors - the rarity, the durability, the malleability

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:45.119
and the beauty - that made it uniquely valuable and suitable as a form of money.

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:49.799
But gold wasn’t always the most practical form of money.

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.539
It was so valuable that even the smallest coins were often equivalent to a week or more’s salary,

00:04:56.769 --> 00:05:02.719
so it couldn’t be used for smaller transactions - paying for a loaf of bread or something like that.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:09.609
So other coins tended to be used, made out of less valuable materials like silver.

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.969
And gold wasn’t great for very large transactions either, because

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.339
it wasn’t exactly convenient to carry around bags of gold coins.

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.499
This led to the creation of a system where people could store their

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:30.439
gold safely with someone else and in return, they would receive a piece

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.259
of paper that said, “This paper represents a certain amount of gold.”

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.089
It was a note from a bank, a banknote, paper money.

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:48.709
The paper itself, the physical material the note was made out of, had no intrinsic value, but it was

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:56.449
the fact that it could be legally exchanged into gold that meant the paper did have implied value.

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.999
And that, in simplified form, was the beginning of paper

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:06.419
money backed by gold, also known as the gold standard.

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.609
So, how exactly did the gold standard work in practice?

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:19.819
Under a gold standard, a country’s currency was directly linked to a specific amount of gold.

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:24.449
The government promised that anyone holding a certain amount of paper

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.539
money could, if they so wanted, exchange it for a fixed amount of gold.

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:38.979
Britain was the first major country to adopt this system, thanks in part to Sir Isaac Newton.

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:44.963
Now, you might know Isaac Newton as the man who sat under a tree and

00:06:44.963 --> 00:06:49.493
an apple fell on his head and he then understood how gravity works.

00:06:50.203 --> 00:06:54.173
He was also the so-called “Master Of The Mint”, meaning

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:56.983
he was in charge of the British monetary system.

00:06:58.093 --> 00:07:05.153
In Britain, silver was originally used for most trading, but as more silver flowed to

00:07:05.203 --> 00:07:12.533
China—whose enormous economy absorbed vast amounts of the stuff— Newton decided to take action.

00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:21.553
He set a fixed exchange rate between silver and gold, and overvalued gold compared to silver.

00:07:22.803 --> 00:07:29.283
This encouraged people to use gold instead of silver, and this helped shift the country

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:37.403
from a bimetallic system to a de facto gold standard, a monetary system based around gold.

00:07:38.893 --> 00:07:47.213
And in 1821, the United Kingdom became the first major country to officially adopt the gold

00:07:47.213 --> 00:07:55.243
standard, setting the value of the British pound at 1 pound equalling 0.25 ounces of gold.

00:07:56.093 --> 00:08:01.893
This gold standard meant that anyone with a 1 pound note could go to

00:08:01.893 --> 00:08:08.413
the Bank of England and swap their £1 note for 0.25 ounces of gold.

00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:13.173
The important thing was that they could, not that they should.

00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:19.463
Obviously, it would have been frustrating for everyone to be constantly going to the bank to

00:08:19.463 --> 00:08:24.613
swap paper money for gold, and then gold back to paper money when they needed to buy something,

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:30.503
but the important thing was that they knew that they could get gold if they needed to.

00:08:32.063 --> 00:08:39.603
And this belief that paper money was backed by something universally valuable built tremendous

00:08:39.643 --> 00:08:45.343
trust in the financial system, and helped facilitate international trade for Britain.

00:08:46.313 --> 00:08:49.873
As the world’s leading economic power at the time, Britain’s

00:08:49.873 --> 00:08:54.353
move to the gold standard in 1821 set a global precedent.

00:08:55.373 --> 00:08:59.163
Other nations, seeing its benefits, soon followed suit.

00:09:00.153 --> 00:09:07.533
First was Canada, in 1853, then Germany and the United States, and by 1873

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:12.253
the gold standard had become the basis for the global monetary system.

00:09:13.702 --> 00:09:18.695
This expansion of the gold standard wasn’t just a matter of policy—it was

00:09:18.705 --> 00:09:24.495
also enabled by the huge amounts of gold entering circulation after the gold

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:29.375
rushes of the mid-19th century, particularly in California and Australia.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:36.415
These discoveries flooded global markets with gold, making international trade easier

00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:41.795
and more reliable and allowing more countries to join the gold standard system.

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:49.305
Currencies were tied to each other, and these currencies in turn were tied to the

00:09:49.305 --> 00:09:54.115
amount of gold that existed in the reserves of the central banks of these countries.

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:58.205
This had a great stabilising act.

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:04.303
Because each country’s currency was tied to gold, the value

00:10:04.323 --> 00:10:08.547
of currencies between countries became more predictable.

00:10:09.937 --> 00:10:14.747
This made international trade much easier, as countries could trade with

00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:19.917
one another confidently, knowing that exchange rates would remain stable.

00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:27.057
Another benefit was that the gold standard prevented governments from printing too much money.

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:33.607
Since the amount of money in circulation was tied to the amount of gold a country

00:10:33.607 --> 00:10:39.717
had in its reserves, governments couldn’t simply print money whenever they wanted.

00:10:40.537 --> 00:10:45.647
This helped to control inflation and maintain the value of the currency.

00:10:46.377 --> 00:10:51.697
One of the reasons that prices for everything increased in 2022 was that

00:10:51.697 --> 00:10:56.327
governments printed vast amounts of money to stimulate the economy during

00:10:56.357 --> 00:11:01.867
COVID-19, meaning that the value of each unit of currency was reduced.

00:11:02.607 --> 00:11:07.997
Under a gold standard system, this can’t happen because a country needs

00:11:07.997 --> 00:11:12.507
to have enough gold in its reserves to maintain its currency, the amount

00:11:12.507 --> 00:11:17.277
of gold needs to be proportionate to the amount of money in circulation.

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:25.327
In other words, if a government prints an extra 10 billion pounds, it needs to add an extra 10

00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:31.917
billion pounds worth of gold to its reserves, because the paper money is tied to physical gold.

00:11:33.137 --> 00:11:38.267
But, while the gold standard was a good thing in terms of reducing

00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:42.437
the probability of inflation, it greatly reduced the ability of a

00:11:42.437 --> 00:11:46.627
country and its government to intervene in the economy if it needed to.

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:50.157
Take, for example, COVID-19.

00:11:51.307 --> 00:11:56.197
Governments around the world injected large amounts of money into the economy, doing

00:11:56.207 --> 00:12:01.937
everything from handing out cash to individuals to giving low-interest loans to businesses.

00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:07.437
This money came from somewhere - it was printed by the central banks.

00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:11.387
This was possible because we don’t have the gold

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:14.167
standard anymore, as we’ll come to talk about in a bit.

00:12:15.347 --> 00:12:20.567
And in fact, it was the need to react to a crisis and the inability

00:12:20.567 --> 00:12:25.341
to do so that caused the first big problem for the gold standard.

00:12:26.477 --> 00:12:31.447
With the outbreak of World War One, countries like the UK, France and Germany

00:12:31.677 --> 00:12:37.187
needed the flexibility to print more money to fund their war efforts, but

00:12:37.437 --> 00:12:41.857
the rigid structure of the gold standard simply didn’t allow for that.

00:12:42.657 --> 00:12:46.067
They needed to increase the money supply without worrying about

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:50.317
having enough gold reserves to back up every note in circulation.

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:57.417
So, they left, or rather, they temporarily abandoned their commitment to the gold standard.

00:12:58.077 --> 00:13:03.437
No longer could a citizen go to a central bank and exchange their banknotes for gold.

00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:11.077
But, as with many “temporary” measures, things didn’t quite go back to normal after the war ended.

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:16.387
Although many countries returned to some form of the gold standard in

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:21.967
the 1920s, the global economy had changed significantly, and it wasn’t

00:13:21.987 --> 00:13:26.007
simply a case of going back to something that had worked 10 years earlier.

00:13:27.367 --> 00:13:30.977
When the Great Depression hit in the early 1930s, it

00:13:30.977 --> 00:13:34.417
made returning to the gold standard even more difficult.

00:13:35.057 --> 00:13:39.559
Economies around the world faced severe hardship, and governments

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:43.829
needed more control over their financial systems to manage the crisis.

00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:49.839
However, the rigid structure of the gold standard tied their hands - they couldn’t print more

00:13:49.839 --> 00:13:56.805
money, and instead had to do things like cut government spending and reduce wages -   Many

00:13:56.805 --> 00:14:02.535
economists argue this is one of the reasons the Great Depression was so devastating.

00:14:03.845 --> 00:14:07.355
Soon, enough, countries started to abandon the gold

00:14:07.355 --> 00:14:11.655
standard, starting with Britain in September 1931.

00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:17.825
No longer could a citizen go to the bank and exchange their pounds for gold.

00:14:18.745 --> 00:14:23.495
However, this didn’t completely free Britain from the influence of gold.

00:14:24.485 --> 00:14:27.675
The British pound became tied to the U.S.

00:14:27.675 --> 00:14:30.375
dollar, which was still backed by gold.

00:14:31.565 --> 00:14:35.565
The dollar had become the central currency of the global monetary

00:14:35.565 --> 00:14:40.281
system, and this arrangement continued even after World War II.

00:14:41.575 --> 00:14:46.834
In 1944, world leaders met at a conference in Bretton Woods, in

00:14:46.974 --> 00:14:50.734
New Hampshire, to design a new international monetary system.

00:14:51.494 --> 00:14:55.854
This conference is probably best known for creating institutions

00:14:55.994 --> 00:15:00.584
like the World Bank and the IMF, which were designed to help manage

00:15:00.604 --> 00:15:05.154
global monetary policy and promote economic stability after the war.

00:15:06.334 --> 00:15:13.474
But another key element of this was the pegging of the world’s largest currencies to the U.S.

00:15:13.474 --> 00:15:21.094
dollar, which was, in turn, pegged to gold at a fixed rate of $35 per ounce.

00:15:22.004 --> 00:15:28.504
So, effectively there was a global gold standard because every key currency - the

00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:32.614
British pound, the French franc, the German Deutsche Mark, and the Japanese

00:15:32.614 --> 00:15:38.554
yen - they were all tied to the US dollar, which was exchangeable for gold.

00:15:39.684 --> 00:15:44.944
This system worked for a while, providing some stability after the war.

00:15:45.684 --> 00:15:48.924
However, by the 1960s, the U.S.

00:15:49.034 --> 00:15:54.174
was printing more and more dollars to fund its involvement in the Vietnam War and its

00:15:54.174 --> 00:16:00.344
domestic programs, without having enough gold to back all the dollars in circulation.

00:16:01.704 --> 00:16:05.644
In 1971, the situation came to a head.

00:16:06.484 --> 00:16:10.024
Countries like France, which held large amounts of U.S.

00:16:10.024 --> 00:16:14.874
dollars, began to demand gold in exchange for their dollars.

00:16:16.064 --> 00:16:21.894
Essentially, they started to lose trust in the value of the paper money, the

00:16:21.894 --> 00:16:27.354
dollars that they held, and they called for their right to exchange it into

00:16:27.354 --> 00:16:31.694
physical gold, which did have intrinsic value, because of all of its physical

00:16:31.694 --> 00:16:36.344
properties that you knew about already and we listed at the start of the episode.

00:16:37.654 --> 00:16:39.654
The problem was the U.S.

00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:46.294
didn’t have enough gold to cover these demands, so when President Richard Nixon saw

00:16:46.294 --> 00:16:53.044
this he made the dramatic decision to suspend the dollar’s convertibility into gold.

00:16:54.014 --> 00:17:00.330
In other words, he said, “Nope, US dollars are no longer backed by gold”.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.970
This was called the Nixon Shock, and it effectively ended the Bretton

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.930
Woods system and the last official link between gold and global currencies.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.050
From 1971 onward, currencies around the world were allowed to “float”.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.860
That meant their value would be determined by the market—by

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.320
supply and demand—rather than by a fixed amount of gold.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.790
And this is the situation we have today.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:40.280
At the time I’m recording this, €1.00 will buy you $1.10.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:47.870
But tomorrow it might buy you $1.09 or $1.11 or more or less,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.900
depending on the perceived value of the Euro and the dollar.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.160
These dollars and Euros are not backed by anything physical.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:02.300
The entire system is based on trust in the government that issues them.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.720
This is called a fiat money system.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:12.530
Fiat money is essentially paper currency that has no intrinsic

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.180
value; its value is based on trust in the issuing body.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.650
And with a fiat money system as opposed to a gold standard system,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.020
governments have much more flexibility in managing their economies.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.760
They can adjust the money supply as needed, without having

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.790
to worry about having enough gold in their reserves.

00:18:35.798 --> 00:18:42.950
But, it also means that there is no limit on how much money can be printed, which has its own

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:49.930
set of risks, such as inflation, as we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other forms of

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:57.760
economic mismanagement as anyone from Turkey or Venezuela or even Zimbabwe will know all too well.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.520
And if you have heard talk of the gold standard in the news over

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.940
the past few years, it might have been in connection with Bitcoin.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:14.300
Proponents of Bitcoin have called it “digital gold”, in that it has many of

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.560
the same properties as gold: it is decentralised [not owned or controlled by

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.490
one country or organisation], there is a finite supply, it is increasingly

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:30.230
expensive to obtain, and as a result, it is not subject to inflation.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:37.910
But, unlike gold, it has no intrinsic value, it is computer code and

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.640
its only value is because other people agree that it is valuable.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:49.620
Now, while most economists today believe that moving away from the gold standard was

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.530
the right decision, there are still some people who argue that we should return to it.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.700
They believe that a gold standard would bring more stability to the

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.940
global economy, would force governments to balance their budgets and

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.790
prevent them from printing too much money which causes inflation.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:14.270
To wrap things up, the gold standard was a fascinating piece of economic history

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:20.650
that was in place in some shape or form for the majority of the past 150 years.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:27.500
The famous economist John Maynard Keynes once called gold ‘a barbarous relic’,

00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:33.860
suggesting that it was both uncivilised and inappropriate for use in a modern society.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.400
Whether you agree with him or not, the move away from the

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.970
gold standard marked a huge shift in how we think about money.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:49.400
Gold has value because we believe it does, and because of what we think we can do with

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:55.960
it—whether that’s wearing something shiny on our neck or storing wealth for future generations.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:01.570
But in the 21st century, value isn’t just about physical

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.770
things; it’s about trust and belief in the financial system.

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:12.500
Money has value because we say it does, or rather, because governments say it does.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:19.150
Bringing it all the way back to the start of the episode, Scrooge McDuck’s greatest pleasure

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:25.850
was unlocking the giant door to his money bin and jumping around in his pile of gold.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:32.760
Scrooge McDuck in 2024 would probably simply pick up his iPhone and

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.570
check his bank balance, counting the many many zeros on the screen.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:46.640
It is a lot less shiny, but the question I’ll leave you with is this: is it any less real?

00:21:48.824 --> 00:21:52.909
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the gold standard.

00:21:53.267 --> 00:21:57.707
I know we went quite deep into economic theory and it was a little different from an

00:21:57.707 --> 00:22:03.567
adventurous tale of a robbery or scandal, but I hope it was an interesting one nevertheless.

00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:09.147

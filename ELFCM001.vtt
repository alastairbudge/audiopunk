Hello and welcome to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.660
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.060
This is the inaugural episode, so it'll be a little different to the rest of them.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.900
In this episode, I'm going to tell you a little bit about the English Learning for Curious Minds

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.440
podcast, about me and about what you can expect from the show.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.100
I'll also give you a few tips on how you can use these podcasts to maximize your English learning.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.515
A lot of these tips will be valid for almost any English podcast you listen to, whatever your level.

00:00:44.953 --> 00:00:50.423
If you like what you hear, well, you can hit subscribe and you'll have the podcast in your pocket so

00:00:50.423 --> 00:00:55.903
you can learn English while learning fascinating things about the world, wherever you are, whatever

00:00:55.903 --> 00:00:56.613
you are doing.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:04.513
You can also find all of the episodes plus transcripts and key vocabulary for everything on the

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:09.303
website, which is www.leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:16.925
So let's get cracking and start with the first question you may be asking yourself, who the hell am

00:01:16.925 --> 00:01:21.955
I and why should you care about anything that I have to say?

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:24.565
Well, excellent question.

00:01:25.346 --> 00:01:26.846
My name is Alastair Budge.

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:32.626
I'm 32 years old and I'm currently recording this podcast from Malta.

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:37.516
If you don't know where that is, it's a small island in the middle of the Mediterranean.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.876
If you can't tell from my accent, I'm English.

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:46.236
I grew up all over the UK actually, but spent most of my life in London.

00:01:47.464 --> 00:01:49.654
Like you, I'm a language learner.

00:01:50.104 --> 00:01:51.894
I speak fluent French and Italian.

00:01:52.094 --> 00:01:56.234
My Italian's actually a little better than my French now, and I have a Master's in Chinese.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.640
Over the years, I've learnt quite a few other languages, including Russian, Japanese, and Latin and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.006
Greek, and I've tried loads of different ways to learn languages, both formal and informal through

00:02:10.006 --> 00:02:14.566
books, films, and of course my favourite method podcasts.

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:17.448
I'm now married to an Italian.

00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:23.528
I live in Malta and have a little baby who can't speak just yet, but I speak English to him and his

00:02:23.528 --> 00:02:28.528
mother speaks Italian to him and in school he'll learn Maltese so we're at least trying to bring up

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:29.848
a trilingual baby.

00:02:30.786 --> 00:02:35.086
In addition to being an avid language learner, I've also been an English teacher.

00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:42.051
So I've experienced language learning both from the teaching side and from the language learner

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:42.421
side.

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.231
So I know what works and more importantly, I know what doesn't work.

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:54.267
What doesn't work, and by this I mean what isn't really going to help you get to any level of

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:57.663
fluency, are grammar books and vocabulary exercises.

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:04.659
You might end up being able to pass a test and scoring high on an IELTS exam, but it's not going to

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.689
do a huge amount to actually help you communicate with native speakers.

00:03:09.737 --> 00:03:16.396
Listening, on the other hand is the number one thing that will help you learn, in my experience.

00:03:16.986 --> 00:03:23.706
And by this I mean listening to native speakers, exposing yourself to how English speakers speak.

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:29.951
This is of course, especially important if you don't have the chance to meet English native speakers

00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.841
that often, let's say you live in a non-English speaking country.

00:03:35.343 --> 00:03:41.123
Now, if you're listening to this podcast, you probably don't need someone to convince you that using

00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:43.523
podcasts to learn a language is a good idea.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:45.613
So I'll save you most of that part.

00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:51.843
But what I will do is tell you a little bit about Leonardo English and the English Learning for

00:03:51.843 --> 00:03:57.833
Curious Minds podcast, why I started it, what I hope you can get out of it, and the sort of things

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.673
that you can expect from the show.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:05.709
Okay, so what is the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast and who is it for?

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.810
I started the podcast quite simply because I wished that something like this had existed for me when

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.420
I started out as a language learner.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:21.717
What always frustrated me was that when, I was learning French and Italian at least, there only

00:04:21.717 --> 00:04:29.257
seemed to be the choice between this boring listening exercise style stuff and content that was

00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:35.277
actually aimed at native speakers, which was often spoken really fast with multiple different

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:39.177
speakers and was quite unforgiving to a language learner.

00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:47.167
I thought, if I was learning a language, what would I want my ideal podcast to have?

00:04:49.287 --> 00:04:53.597
Well for starters, it would be about something that was actually interesting to me.

00:04:54.487 --> 00:04:59.877
I'm not interested in scripted conversations about people going shopping or talking about their

00:05:00.017 --> 00:05:05.737
family members or hobbies, nor am I really interested in small talk conversations.

00:05:07.197 --> 00:05:13.447
I'm the kind of person who really wants to learn interesting things about the way the world works as

00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:18.247
I learn a language, I just get bored with small talk and scripted conversation.

00:05:20.127 --> 00:05:26.367
So that was one must, that the podcast would teach people something over and above language.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:33.465
Secondly, it would have to have some additional materials to help me if I got stuck.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:40.615
Now, this doesn't mean that every word would have to be translated, but it would mean that there was

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:41.935
something to help me.

00:05:42.372 --> 00:05:48.942
A transcript is a must and also some highlighted vocabulary so that I wasn't always having to look

00:05:48.942 --> 00:05:50.042
things up in a dictionary.

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:58.307
I'm the kind of person who quickly loses attention if I have to be constantly looking things up in a

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:04.327
dictionary, and so some way of avoiding this was necessary for this dream podcast.

00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:11.537
So I looked around and nothing really existed like this for English language learners.

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:14.037
So I thought, okay, I'll make it.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:19.377
Now, what can you expect from this podcast?

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:23.017
On one level, it's quite simple.

00:06:23.595 --> 00:06:25.715
Podcasts for the curious mind.

00:06:26.435 --> 00:06:31.645
Listening to the podcast will help you improve your English communication while you learn

00:06:31.805 --> 00:06:33.515
fascinating things about the world.

00:06:35.575 --> 00:06:42.280
And if you don't know what I mean by a curious mind, I just mean someone who's always curious, whose

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.110
mind is constantly whirring away.

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:47.809
They just want to know the way things work.

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:54.089
They want to know how and why, and they're the kind of person who has this innate thirst for

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:57.529
knowledge, who just wants to absorb information.

00:06:58.839 --> 00:07:03.179
If this is you, then this will all be pretty familiar, I guess.

00:07:04.088 --> 00:07:09.798
All of the podcasts we produce are aimed squarely at English learners with curious minds.

00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:17.863
They are all thoroughly researched and we aim to condense fascinating stories or concepts into

00:07:17.863 --> 00:07:21.513
manageable podcasts each between 10 and 20 minutes long.

00:07:22.444 --> 00:07:29.244
But don't expect the vocabulary, grammar, or sentence structure to be dulled down just because

00:07:29.244 --> 00:07:30.674
they're for non-native speakers.

00:07:32.064 --> 00:07:38.364
Yes, the speed of the podcasts and the speed of the speech may be a little slower than if you are

00:07:38.364 --> 00:07:42.774
listening to the news or content aimed directly for native speakers.

00:07:43.489 --> 00:07:50.209
And I'll make sure that I or any of the guests on the podcast speak clearly, but it won't be

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:54.919
artificially slow, as that's just not how you learn effectively.

00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:00.843
We'll use vocabulary in a way that's engaging, authentic, and non-trivial.

00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:06.560
You can follow everything in the key vocabulary or transcript on the website if you have trouble and

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.710
we'll cover exactly how you can use those towards the end of the podcast.

00:08:10.278 --> 00:08:16.070
We want every podcast to teach you something new, for you to finish listening to it and go, wow,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.800
that was cool.

00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:24.297
We're going to be doing episodes on a whole range of subjects from black holes to a sea that

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:30.397
disappeared from talking about the greatest prison escapes of all time, to the fascinating history

00:08:30.397 --> 00:08:31.707
of the English breakfast.

00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:36.717
If it's not interesting, well, we're just not going to make a podcast about it.

00:08:38.842 --> 00:08:44.732
We'll release at least two podcasts a week, one on a Tuesday, one on a Friday, and there will be

00:08:44.762 --> 00:08:47.282
bonus longer episodes once a month.

00:08:48.729 --> 00:08:50.987
The podcasts will all be relatively short.

00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:57.127
Most will be around 10 minutes and everything will be under 20 so they're just the right length that

00:08:57.127 --> 00:09:01.637
you can fit them into your day without having to carve out a huge amount of time.

00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:07.626
Now getting onto the next part, how should you actually use podcasts to learn English?

00:09:08.973 --> 00:09:12.313
Well, there is a mammoth guide on this on the blog.

00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:17.903
I think it's almost 5,000 words long, so if you really want to read up about this, then I'd

00:09:17.903 --> 00:09:19.203
recommend checking out that guide.

00:09:19.233 --> 00:09:25.598
I'll also add it into the show notes, and there's another podcast coming out on how to use podcasts

00:09:25.908 --> 00:09:29.498
to learn English so that will have a whole load of information as well.

00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:34.908
But I just wanted to touch on a few simple ways that you can use podcasts, to learn English.

00:09:36.128 --> 00:09:41.018
I should point out that all of these tips apply to any podcasts you listen to, not just this one.

00:09:42.138 --> 00:09:42.498
Okay.

00:09:42.528 --> 00:09:48.958
Number one tip is, if you can, to listen without distractions so make sure you're listening

00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:50.998
actively, not passively.

00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:52.918
What do I mean by this?

00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:59.033
Well, active listening means sitting down with a notebook, writing down interesting phrases or words

00:09:59.033 --> 00:09:59.843
you don't understand.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:07.096
It can mean doing things like trying to transcribe the podcast or shadowing, so speaking out loud at

00:10:07.096 --> 00:10:08.466
the same time as I am.

00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:13.821
You can find the transcript on the website, so that's Leonardoenglish.com.

00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:17.961
You can also print that out and use it as an aid to help you as you go along.

00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:24.581
The main difference between active and passive listening is active listening is when you're

00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:28.921
listening and you're completely focused on the podcast.

00:10:29.476 --> 00:10:33.226
Passive listening is when you're doing it while you're doing something else.

00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:40.216
So perhaps you're running, driving in the car, doing the dishes, doing whatever it might be, but

00:10:40.246 --> 00:10:46.216
it's quite difficult, especially when you're listening to a podcast in a second language to actively

00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:48.336
concentrate when you're doing something else.

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:55.856
Second tip is to set aside a time every day or week and stick to it.

00:10:57.186 --> 00:11:01.916
It's the easiest thing in the world to say to yourself, okay, cool, I'll start listening to a

00:11:01.916 --> 00:11:07.466
podcast to learn a language, but if you don't set aside time in your day, you're much less likely to

00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:14.156
actually do it, even if it's just 10 minutes after your shower in the morning or 20 minutes during

00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:14.796
your lunch break.

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.791
Set aside the time for it and actually do it.

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:26.534
And the final tip, and this is of course not revolutionary, is to find other people to listen to the

00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:27.424
podcast with.

00:11:28.814 --> 00:11:34.744
If there's a friend or colleague who is a similar level to you, then listen to it together, discuss

00:11:34.744 --> 00:11:38.774
it in English, of course, and use it as a way to practice speaking.

00:11:40.644 --> 00:11:46.994
Podcasts are such an incredible language learning tool, but they're so underused by most English

00:11:46.994 --> 00:11:47.814
language learners.

00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:54.499
They teach you listening, of course, but if you use them properly, they can also help your speaking,

00:11:54.539 --> 00:11:55.589
reading and writing.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:01.210
Plus they live on your phone, you can access them whenever you want, and you get to hear directly

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.200
from native speakers.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.660
So just think about it.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:09.660
People spend thousands of dollars to go and do intensive language immersion courses in places where

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:16.360
native speakers are, but they could get immediate access 24 hours a day to native speakers directly

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.230
in their ears, through their headphones, through a podcast for free.

00:12:20.628 --> 00:12:25.458
As I'm sure you can guess, I'm a bit of a fan of podcasts, but that's just because I know how

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:32.037
powerful they can be and I hope through listening to this podcast and learning with Leonardo English

00:12:32.037 --> 00:12:36.807
and the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast, you'll come round to my way of thinking too.

00:12:38.712 --> 00:12:39.222
Right.

00:12:39.252 --> 00:12:41.622
This episode has just been a taster.

00:12:42.372 --> 00:12:47.462
Yes, you could of course say that this first one hasn't been a fascinating story that has taught you

00:12:48.092 --> 00:12:52.462
about the way the world works, but I hope it has given you an idea of things to come.

00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:55.092
So should you hit subscribe?

00:12:55.222 --> 00:12:56.622
Well, that's up to you.

00:12:57.172 --> 00:12:59.322
All I can say is that we have big plans.

00:12:59.642 --> 00:13:04.592
There's going to be a load of interesting stuff coming up over the next few weeks, and if you want

00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:09.962
something that is far more interesting than phrasal verbs or vocabulary books, then I hope we tick

00:13:09.962 --> 00:13:10.432
this box.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.230
I also want to say that Leonardo English isn't some huge, faceless corporation.

00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:21.834
I want you to be a part of it, and if you've got an idea for an episode, you have some feedback on

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:26.944
the podcast, or there are any questions that you might have, then come and say, hello, we don't

00:13:26.944 --> 00:13:27.244
bite.

00:13:27.705 --> 00:13:33.345
You can say hello on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com, on the Learn English with Podcasts

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:38.625
group on Facebook, so just search, learn English with podcasts on Facebook, or on Instagram at

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:39.395
LeonardoEnglishapp.

00:13:39.995 --> 00:13:43.605
I would love to hear from you, and all feedback is good feedback.

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:45.085
Okay.

00:13:45.275 --> 00:13:47.755
So that's it for episode number one.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:51.095
I hope you've enjoyed it and that it's given you a taste of things to come.

00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.581
You've been listening to the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast by Leonardo English.

00:13:57.101 --> 00:14:00.031
I'm Alastair Budge and I'll catch you in the next episode.

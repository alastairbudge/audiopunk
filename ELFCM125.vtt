Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:16.938
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:20.998
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:26.948
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about debt.

00:00:28.058 --> 00:00:33.458
Debt is a hugely important part of how the world works, from paying for

00:00:33.488 --> 00:00:38.778
things on a credit card to buying a house, from how businesses grow to

00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:43.018
how countries manage to pay for things during devastating pandemics.

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:50.598
It is, of course, a vastly complicated subject, so we are going to focus on one area in particular.

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:56.448
And that is government debt, the debt that countries take on to pay

00:00:56.448 --> 00:01:01.178
for things if they need to spend more money than they receive in taxes.

00:01:02.408 --> 00:01:09.708
As you will know, due to COVID-19 most countries have had to pay vast amounts of money to support

00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:16.238
their citizens during the pandemic, and have taken on large amounts of debt to pay for all of this.

00:01:17.128 --> 00:01:22.298
So, in today’s episode we are going to talk about what this debt actually is,

00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:28.978
where it comes from, how does it actually work, and does the fact that many

00:01:28.978 --> 00:01:34.228
countries continue to spend more money than they receive in taxes actually matter?

00:01:35.248 --> 00:01:39.308
We have a lot ahead of us in today’s episode, so let’s get started.

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:43.718
Before we get right into the question of government debt,

00:01:44.128 --> 00:01:48.088
it’s worth discussing briefly what debt actually is.

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:54.788
Debt is the promise of one party, a person, a country, a company, an

00:01:54.828 --> 00:02:00.668
organisation, to pay something, or do something, at some point in the future.

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:06.618
If you have a credit card and you buy something in a shop, the credit card

00:02:06.648 --> 00:02:11.588
company is in debt to the shop, and you are in debt to the credit card company.

00:02:12.728 --> 00:02:17.288
If you buy a house, you normally buy it with a mortgage from the bank.

00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:23.288
The bank lends you the money to buy the rest of the house, and you are in debt to the

00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:28.228
bank until you finish paying off your debt, until you finish paying off your mortgage.

00:02:29.488 --> 00:02:34.588
In both of these cases, the money is just created, magically, by the

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:40.428
credit card company or the bank, it comes from nowhere, but suddenly

00:02:40.568 --> 00:02:44.658
there is money in the financial system, debt, that you need to pay.

00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:52.708
And whether it’s buying something online and being offered the possibility to pay it later, or in

00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:59.858
separate installments, or to lease a car over several years, to take a loan to pay for university,

00:03:00.328 --> 00:03:07.468
or to buy a piece of furniture, debt is all around us, and almost everyone has some form of debt.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:15.788
But the largest form of debt is the debt that countries take on, which is called sovereign debt.

00:03:16.908 --> 00:03:21.728
Countries, just like people, have income, they have money that comes in,

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:25.928
and they have expenses, they have things they need to spend money on.

00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:31.338
The income comes from taxes, and the expenses go on things

00:03:31.348 --> 00:03:35.378
like education, hospitals, roads, and all that kind of stuff.

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:39.868
And, much like for you and me, a country’s expenses

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:43.718
can’t continue to be higher than its income forever.

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:50.018
It can’t always spend more than it brings in, otherwise it runs out of money.

00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:54.118
Or at least that was what people used to think.

00:03:55.348 --> 00:03:59.468
Historically, countries have, of course, gone through periods

00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:03.018
of spending much more money than they received in taxes.

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:10.728
During periods of war countries would almost always spend more money than they made.

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:15.488
Not only does a country not have as much money coming in

00:04:15.528 --> 00:04:19.838
through taxes, but it also has the costs of fighting the war.

00:04:20.888 --> 00:04:24.988
Countries would manage this by borrowing money, by going

00:04:25.018 --> 00:04:28.568
into debt in order to pay for these extra expenses.

00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:32.818
They would normally do this by borrowing money from

00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:37.048
private investors, by selling things called bonds.

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:44.718
Then, after the war was over, economic growth would start up again, the country would be able

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:51.768
to raise money through taxes, and pay off these debts, usually over an extended period of time.

00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:59.178
So, historically, government debt, the debt that a country owes, was something

00:04:59.358 --> 00:05:04.488
that countries would do in extraordinary circumstances, in unusual times.

00:05:05.608 --> 00:05:11.008
In the UK, government debt peaked during the Napoleonic Wars, and then

00:05:11.288 --> 00:05:16.108
after the first and second world wars, but was being paid back, and was

00:05:16.118 --> 00:05:22.528
being reduced almost every year, until the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008.

00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:25.928
And the UK is not alone.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:31.685
Many countries have been taking on more and more debt over the past 10 to 15

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:38.268
years, and now have large debt to GDP ratios - that’s the ratio of how much

00:05:38.268 --> 00:05:42.848
they owe to how much economic activity is created in the country each year.

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:50.008
After the financial crisis of 2007-2008, after governments had been forced to

00:05:50.198 --> 00:05:55.768
borrow more and more money to rescue their economies and their banks, in much

00:05:55.788 --> 00:06:01.128
of Europe there was the idea that countries needed to embark on periods of

00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:06.218
austerity, that they needed to reduce their costs in order to pay down their debts.

00:06:07.218 --> 00:06:10.678
In the UK there were big cuts to public services.

00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:16.048
Budgets were slashed, they were cut dramatically, people were sacked,

00:06:16.298 --> 00:06:20.873
as the government tried to balance its books, to reduce the debt that

00:06:21.058 --> 00:06:25.908
it had taken on to pay to bail out the banks after the financial crisis.

00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:33.873
And in Europe, as listeners from countries like Italy, Greece, Portugal and Spain will know

00:06:33.963 --> 00:06:39.953
all too well, other countries in the Eurozone, mainly to the north of Europe, pressured

00:06:39.983 --> 00:06:46.833
countries in the South to undergo a period of austerity to get their debts under control.

00:06:47.643 --> 00:06:51.348
And then, in 2020, along came COVID-19.

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:55.953
As we all know, economies were effectively shut down.

00:06:56.453 --> 00:06:59.063
Jobs were lost, businesses went bankrupt.

00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:04.543
To varying degrees, countries provided support to people and businesses.

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:09.563
In many cases, this was done, and is still being done,

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:13.223
by the government paying people and businesses directly.

00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:19.703
In the UK there was something called the furlough scheme, where the government would

00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:27.363
contribute 80% of someone’s salary, up to £2,500 a month, if they were unable to work as usual.

00:07:28.353 --> 00:07:31.663
Businesses were given grants, they were given money

00:07:31.673 --> 00:07:34.953
by the government to stay afloat, to stay in business.

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:40.393
So, where did, and where does all this money come from?

00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:45.893
The government didn’t just have a load of money sitting around in its account

00:07:46.093 --> 00:07:49.643
waiting for the next pandemic, it had to get this money from somewhere.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:52.183
And how did it do it?

00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:56.023
By borrowing it, by going further into debt.

00:07:57.203 --> 00:08:03.563
Indeed, the UK’s public debt is now over 2 trillion pounds, more than its GDP.

00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:07.743
So the UK, or I should perhaps say, the people of

00:08:07.743 --> 00:08:11.513
the UK owe more than the country produces every year.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:19.140
As a percentage of GDP, it's not the highest, it's only just over 100%.

00:08:19.822 --> 00:08:28.512
Italy is around 150%, Greece is around 190%, and Japan is around 220%.

00:08:28.822 --> 00:08:33.362
So, Japan has a debt of 2.2 times its GDP.

00:08:34.862 --> 00:08:40.522
Certainly in the near term these numbers aren’t going to get any lower, as countries

00:08:40.642 --> 00:08:45.812
will continue to spend more than they earn to fight the impact of COVID-19.

00:08:47.092 --> 00:08:51.502
If these countries were individuals, if these countries were people, this

00:08:51.692 --> 00:08:55.722
evidently wouldn’t be a situation that would be able to continue for long.

00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:59.472
The people we owed money to would come knocking on

00:08:59.472 --> 00:09:02.402
our doors and say, ‘hey you, I’m here for my money.’

00:09:03.602 --> 00:09:09.902
But countries are not people, and they have several tools at their disposal that people don’t.

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:15.222
To start with, for countries with their own currencies, with their

00:09:15.222 --> 00:09:20.272
own money, if the debt is denominated in their currency, they could

00:09:20.332 --> 00:09:25.872
theoretically just pay it off by printing more money, by creating more of it.

00:09:26.772 --> 00:09:32.012
It’s the Bank of England that decides when and why to print money, and if

00:09:32.012 --> 00:09:36.182
it wants to print more money to pay off UK government debt, it can do that.

00:09:37.532 --> 00:09:42.082
The UK government could, in theory, tell the Bank of England, that’s

00:09:42.282 --> 00:09:47.182
the British equivalent of the Federal Reserve, to print £2 trillion

00:09:47.682 --> 00:09:52.072
tomorrow, pay off all of the debt and the country would be debt free.

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:58.682
Or it could even go one step further and print £5 trillion, £2 trillion to

00:09:58.922 --> 00:10:04.512
pay off the debt and £3 trillion to spend on hospitals, schools and roads.

00:10:05.502 --> 00:10:11.192
It might sound like a good idea, but there are some very good reasons why it doesn’t happen.

00:10:12.292 --> 00:10:19.092
Firstly, adding large amounts of money to the money supply is a surefire way to increase

00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:24.582
inflation if it isn’t followed by a similarly large increase in economic activity.

00:10:25.572 --> 00:10:30.012
It might work in the short term, but if people can’t trust that their

00:10:30.082 --> 00:10:34.212
money won’t decrease in value, they will lose trust in the system.

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:37.402
Weimar Germany learned this lesson the hard way.

00:10:38.602 --> 00:10:43.242
Secondly, countries can borrow money at such low costs that

00:10:43.552 --> 00:10:46.142
it doesn’t really matter if they owe large amounts of it.

00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:51.652
If you or I want to take on debt, depending on what we want to buy,

00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:56.402
we are offered different interest rates by the bank, based on how

00:10:56.432 --> 00:11:00.432
likely the bank thinks it is that they will get their money back.

00:11:01.522 --> 00:11:06.702
If we buy a house, the interest rate will be lower, we will have to pay less,

00:11:06.972 --> 00:11:10.912
because the bank can come and take your house if you stop paying it back.

00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:15.102
You can’t run away with a house because, well, it’s a house.

00:11:16.132 --> 00:11:22.432
But if you want a loan to buy a new TV or to go on holiday, well you’ll be offered

00:11:22.602 --> 00:11:26.772
a higher rate because the bank can’t easily come and take those things back.

00:11:27.822 --> 00:11:34.092
When it comes to countries, as they don’t tend to go bankrupt, and they can’t run away, they can

00:11:34.202 --> 00:11:41.752
normally get very low interest rates, so the cost of actually going into debt for them is very low.

00:11:43.232 --> 00:11:49.562
Countries can also relatively easily reduce their debts by either increasing their

00:11:49.572 --> 00:11:55.942
revenues, through things like increasing taxes, or cutting their costs, by reducing budgets.

00:11:56.862 --> 00:12:03.292
Naturally, they can’t do this forever, but it’s far easier for a country to say “right,

00:12:03.532 --> 00:12:09.832
citizens, we need another billion pounds a year so we’re raising taxes by 1% percent” than you

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:15.302
or I saying to our boss “Right, I need you to give me a pay rise because I can’t pay my bills”.

00:12:16.342 --> 00:12:22.792
And finally, countries can grow their way out of debt, they can grow economically,

00:12:23.032 --> 00:12:28.442
which leads to more tax revenues, and they can repay their debts, if they so choose.

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:36.132
So, that’s a brief outline of the situation, of how countries take on debt, why they

00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:41.822
do it, how much of it there actually is around, and why they don’t just pay it off.

00:12:42.632 --> 00:12:48.132
But the most interesting question to ask ourselves next is “after the

00:12:48.132 --> 00:12:53.642
huge increase in national debt due to COVID-19, what happens next?”

00:12:54.852 --> 00:13:01.192
The Napoleonic Wars, when Britain was at war with France, was a time that Britain’s national

00:13:01.192 --> 00:13:09.932
debt grew hugely, and indeed as a percentage of GDP it was almost twice as much as it is now.

00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:16.332
When the war ended the government raised taxes slightly, and cut spending,

00:13:16.652 --> 00:13:22.142
but it took almost 100 years for the debt to return to its previous level.

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:23.922
What about now?

00:13:24.822 --> 00:13:30.852
Do we in the UK, or anywhere else in the world for that matter, do we need to do the same thing?

00:13:31.842 --> 00:13:39.592
Who pays, if anyone actually needs to pay, for the cost of government debt taken on during COVID-19?

00:13:40.742 --> 00:13:46.362
Raising taxes is never a politically popular decision, and even if

00:13:46.362 --> 00:13:50.882
that were the only way to repay the debts, there are few politicians

00:13:51.132 --> 00:13:55.152
who would want to stick their necks out and campaign for higher taxes.

00:13:56.222 --> 00:14:01.172
Cutting government spending is, of course, a possibility, but that’s neither

00:14:01.202 --> 00:14:06.442
a politically popular decision nor always the economist’s preferred choice.

00:14:07.262 --> 00:14:11.992
So, if tax receipts don’t go up, and government spending

00:14:12.082 --> 00:14:16.382
doesn’t go down, what happens to this huge pile of debt?

00:14:17.712 --> 00:14:23.412
Governments have to pay interest on it every year, and even though this might be

00:14:23.412 --> 00:14:29.952
small in percentage terms, it’s still large in terms of dollar, pound or Euro amounts.

00:14:31.312 --> 00:14:36.602
There are some arguments to just forgive these debts, to wipe them out, but

00:14:36.972 --> 00:14:41.962
that would never really apply to wealthy countries like the UK or the US.

00:14:42.482 --> 00:14:49.122
And even for countries that don’t have the resources to pay back their debts, just canceling

00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:56.122
the debt would be a big sign to potential future lenders, to people who might lend money

00:14:56.122 --> 00:15:01.212
to the country in the future, that they might not get their money back, which would lead to

00:15:01.222 --> 00:15:05.932
higher borrowing costs down the line, it would make the debt more expensive in the future.

00:15:07.342 --> 00:15:11.032
The other question relates to the people that own the debt.

00:15:11.872 --> 00:15:18.412
If I owe you €100, then you probably would want me to pay you back because, well,

00:15:18.422 --> 00:15:23.382
it’s €100 and if it’s yours you would rather have it than allow me to keep it.

00:15:24.492 --> 00:15:31.612
But if I owe you a billion euros, and of course here I am a country and you are another

00:15:31.612 --> 00:15:37.322
country or a financial institution, then you might not really want me to pay you back.

00:15:38.612 --> 00:15:44.482
You are quite happy with me paying you a bit of interest, and you know that that debt is

00:15:44.492 --> 00:15:49.422
worth something, you are quite happy for me just to have it, for it to be safe with me.

00:15:50.562 --> 00:15:55.832
If I paid it all back to you, you would have to find something else to do with that money.

00:15:57.142 --> 00:16:01.002
Now, you might be thinking ‘well, I’m sure anyone would be happy

00:16:01.002 --> 00:16:05.312
to be repaid their billion dollars’, but it’s not that simple.

00:16:06.272 --> 00:16:10.892
People like buying government debt, they like buying bonds, because it

00:16:10.892 --> 00:16:15.322
is safe, and in most cases they aren’t buying it because they want to

00:16:15.552 --> 00:16:18.780
be paid back immediately, they are buying it as a long term investment.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.983
So, countries are going more and more into debt, to themselves, to their citizens,

00:16:26.983 --> 00:16:31.742
and to each other, and there isn’t much sign that this is ever going to end.

00:16:32.722 --> 00:16:34.562
But, does this matter?

00:16:35.622 --> 00:16:41.989
When you see statistics like "every man, woman and child in the US has a national debt of

00:16:41.989 --> 00:16:48.702
$80,000", or you see that countries are spending billions fighting COVID-19, or when you

00:16:48.702 --> 00:16:54.892
see news headlines around the huge cost of ambitious projects, rebuilding infrastructure

00:16:54.912 --> 00:17:00.482
or investing in green technologies, should this mean that you lose any sleep over it?

00:17:01.122 --> 00:17:02.272
Well, not really.

00:17:03.052 --> 00:17:08.442
For as long as there are people who want to lend countries money, they will continue to borrow it.

00:17:09.732 --> 00:17:14.942
Theresa May, the ex British Prime Minister, when she was asked about why nurses

00:17:15.162 --> 00:17:20.512
couldn’t get a pay rise, once famously said “There is no magic money tree”.

00:17:21.692 --> 00:17:26.792
She meant that the UK government can’t just create money out of nothing, that

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:31.522
there isn’t just an unlimited amount of money that can be used to pay for stuff.

00:17:32.612 --> 00:17:39.482
This was back in 2017, when the UK government debt was considerably lower than it is now.

00:17:40.332 --> 00:17:44.472
Well, it turns out that her successors have discovered

00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:47.882
a magic money tree, and it is called government debt.

00:17:48.992 --> 00:17:54.932
They have certainly shaken it down very well, to the tune of over two hundred billion dollars.

00:17:55.502 --> 00:17:58.912
And only time will tell what the consequences of doing

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:03.052
so will be, and when, if ever, they plan to pay it back.

00:18:05.072 --> 00:18:09.282
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Debt.

00:18:09.762 --> 00:18:13.102

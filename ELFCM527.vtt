Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.370
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.639
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:25.794
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about Banksy.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.240
He’s one of the most famous modern British artists, known for

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.569
creating works that sell for millions—yet no one knows his real name.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.410
So in this episode we are going to talk about the history of this anonymous artist, how he came

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.660
to prominence, his impact on British society and some of his most famous and controversial works.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.956
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about Banksy.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:01:01.240
Sotheby’s is one of the oldest and most prestigious auction houses in the world.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:09.920
It has sold works by Pablo Picasso, Monet, Andy Warhol, Vincent Van Gogh, Edvard Munch, you name it.

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.080
And, as you might imagine, the prices are often eye-watering.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:25.080
Amedeo Modigliani's "Nu Couché" went for a whopping $157 million back in 2018, and

00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:30.230
that is a record that might well be broken by the time you listen to this episode.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.661
Billionaire American financiers, Russian oligarchs, and middle Eastern royalty.

00:01:35.984 --> 00:01:40.274
jet into London to observe the auction and fly away the next

00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:44.044
day with a new piece of art to add to their private collection.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:52.984
And in October of 2018, Sotheby’s was hosting an auction that was meant to be like any other.

00:01:54.134 --> 00:01:59.654
One of the works up for grabs was a painting called “Girl with a balloon”.

00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:07.084
It is a black stencil drawing of a young girl looking up at a red love heart-shaped balloon.

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:13.404
Now, versions of this painting had been painted on walls all over London, you

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:18.205
might well have seen them yourself, and prints had been sold at auction before.

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:24.945
But this painting was an original from back in 2006, not a print.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:31.485
The auctioneer introduced the work, suggested a starting bid, encouraged the audience

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:36.815
to up their bids, said the famous lines of “going once, going twice”, and then

00:02:36.915 --> 00:02:42.644
bang, went the gavel, the special hammer, to indicate that the sale was complete.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:48.772
The final price for the work was £1.04 million,

00:02:48.974 --> 00:02:53.264
something like €1.5 million when adjusting for inflation.

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:56.994
It was a record price for the artist at the time,

00:02:57.405 --> 00:03:00.244
but it was nothing out of the ordinary for Sotheby’s.

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:05.194
But just as the hammer came down to indicate the

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:09.216
sale was final, something unusual started to happen.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:16.626
An alarm went off, and the painting started to slide down out of its frame.

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:22.896
The room erupted in gasps as the painting began shredding

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:27.106
before their eyes, like a classified document being destroyed.

00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:31.838
This was some kind of trick, this work of art that had just been

00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:36.348
sold for literally over a million pounds, a life-changing amount of

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:40.568
money for the artist, was being destroyed in front of its new owner.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:45.978
It was a bold statement, but was yet another example of an

00:03:46.018 --> 00:03:49.958
artist sticking two fingers up at the art establishment.

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:54.868
In the case of this artist, it was not unexpected.

00:03:56.024 --> 00:04:00.673
This artist was and still is only known by his pseudonym, Banksy.

00:04:01.984 --> 00:04:07.038
Banksy’s story begins in the city of Bristol, in the southwest of England.

00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:14.698
As you may know, Bristol is a relatively small city, but it’s known for its vibrant

00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:20.898
cultural and music scene, and, most importantly for our story, its graffiti culture.

00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:27.188
Graffiti, just in case you didn’t know the word, is street art, often

00:04:27.218 --> 00:04:30.648
sprayed or painted on a wall without the permission of the owner.

00:04:32.023 --> 00:04:37.634
It was in the 1990s that a young Banksy began his journey into the world of street art.

00:04:38.443 --> 00:04:44.243
Nobody knows his exact age or background, but it’s widely believed

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:49.283
that he was born in the early 1970s and grew up in the Bristol area.

00:04:50.772 --> 00:04:56.392
Like many street artists of the time, Banksy was drawn to graffiti as a way

00:04:56.392 --> 00:05:01.542
of making a statement, of rebelling against authority, and of turning the dull

00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:06.642
grey walls of a city into something vibrant, alive, and thought-provoking.

00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:13.412
He started as part of a graffiti crew that would dash around the city at night, spraying

00:05:13.442 --> 00:05:19.242
tags, murals, and large, big letters that boldly proclaimed the names of the artists.

00:05:20.412 --> 00:05:27.352
But Banksy was not your run-of-the-mill graffiti artist; something about his work was different.

00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:33.001
His art was more than just a name on a wall—it was pretty clear

00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:37.891
that he wanted it to tell a story, to get people to stop and think.

00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:44.011
One of his first iconic works was called “The Mild Mild West”,

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:49.041
which shows a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at riot police.

00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:55.921
This was thought to be a statement against police cracking down heavily on rave culture,

00:05:56.301 --> 00:06:02.366
big illegal dance parties in warehouses, and was Banksy’s way of saying that even hippies

00:06:02.366 --> 00:06:07.686
and otherwise non-confrontational types of people can fight back against authority.

00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:13.936
If you've seen some of Banksy’s works, you’ll know that the police is a recurrent

00:06:13.946 --> 00:06:20.126
theme - police officers often doing unexpected things or being in unexpected situations.

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:25.196
And if you have seen a Banksy, you will know that they

00:06:25.196 --> 00:06:29.806
are almost always inimitable, they are unquestionably him.

00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:37.996
And it isn’t just the content or the message of the art that is unmistakably Banksy, but the style.

00:06:38.656 --> 00:06:43.896
While many graffiti artists would start from scratch, armed with just a can of spray

00:06:43.896 --> 00:06:50.146
paint against a blank wall, almost all of Banksy’s works are done using stencils.

00:06:50.716 --> 00:06:55.706
Now stencils are the cutout shapes that you can place onto something,

00:06:56.026 --> 00:07:00.826
spray everywhere, then remove, and you are left with your desired shape.

00:07:02.196 --> 00:07:06.286
He would later say that he got this idea after running away from the police

00:07:06.286 --> 00:07:10.786
one night and noticing a stenciled plate on the truck he was hiding under.

00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:16.876
If he could use the same technique with his graffiti, it would massively reduce the

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:22.356
amount of time it took to put up a mural, and therefore reduce the risk of getting caught.

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:29.556
And just in case it needs underlining, like in most countries, in the UK, graffiti is

00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:34.196
illegal, you cannot do it without the permission of the person who owns the building.

00:07:35.066 --> 00:07:40.216
But through the use of stencils, Banksy’s murals appeared overnight,

00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:45.076
transforming blank walls before sunrise, leaving police none the wiser

00:07:46.506 --> 00:07:52.216
And by the late 1990s, Banksy’s art was popping up all over Bristol.

00:07:53.076 --> 00:08:00.409
The style was inimitable, it was clearly him, but they weren’t signed, there was no tag, no nothing.

00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:04.519
It was Banksy, but who was Banksy?

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:06.559
Nobody knew.

00:08:07.109 --> 00:08:11.329
This anonymity wasn’t just a choice, of course, it was a necessity.

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:17.363
Street art is illegal, and if his identity were revealed, he could be prosecuted.

00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:23.179
But over the years, this anonymity has added to his mystique.

00:08:23.929 --> 00:08:24.979
Who is Banksy?

00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:30.489
I’ve been referring to Banksy as “he” because there have been multiple interviews

00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:37.112
with a masked man who says he is Banksy, and Banksy’s agent refers to him as “he”.

00:08:37.902 --> 00:08:40.642
But over the years, this has been questioned.

00:08:41.492 --> 00:08:44.042
If he is a man, who is he?

00:08:44.412 --> 00:08:48.592
And what if he isn’t a man, but a woman, or even a

00:08:48.592 --> 00:08:51.212
collection of people working together as “Banksy”?

00:08:52.692 --> 00:08:56.322
It is a closely guarded secret, and this mystery has

00:08:56.322 --> 00:08:59.392
only fueled the public’s fascination with his work.

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:05.450
By the early 2000s, Banksy’s work had started to appear beyond Bristol.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:13.070
His unique style—witty, satirical, and deeply political—could be found in cities all over the UK.

00:09:14.107 --> 00:09:18.265
And here, it’s important to emphasise that his art was public, it was

00:09:18.465 --> 00:09:24.135
street art, done specifically in public places to be consumed by the public.

00:09:24.775 --> 00:09:29.205
It wasn’t confined to galleries or museums; it was on walls,

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:33.295
bridges, and streets, often in places you wouldn’t expect.

00:09:34.425 --> 00:09:37.595
And these murals carried powerful messages.

00:09:38.295 --> 00:09:42.185
They made people stop, think, and sometimes laugh.

00:09:43.705 --> 00:09:49.732
One of his early famous works, “ Kissing Coppers,” was painted on the side of a pub in Brighton.

00:09:50.882 --> 00:09:57.470
Now, “copper” is a British slang term for a police officer, and Brighton is a city

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:03.520
known for being open-minded and inclusive, and is often named as the UK’s gay capital.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.180
And this work, “Kissing Coppers”, showed two policemen, two male police officers, passionately

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.970
kissing in their full police uniform, complete with helmets, batons, and handcuffs.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.120
Now, what made Banksy’s work stand out wasn’t just the quality of

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.430
the art—it was the way it challenged society, and got people to

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.420
stop and think about whatever message the artist was trying to send.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.110
His murals were political, satirical, and often critical of those in power.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:45.680
He mocked consumerism, capitalism, war, and even the art world itself,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.500
which would be especially evident in the case of the self-destructing

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.640
million-pound painting we heard about at the start of the episode.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.890
To make these statements, he would travel all over the world, and address

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.000
issues much larger and more delicate than the police presence in Bristol.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:09.190
In 2005, for example, Banksy travelled to the Middle East and painted

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.480
several images on the wall that separates Israel from the West Bank.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.960
One of these works depicted a small girl being lifted into the air

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.100
by balloons, as if floating over the wall to freedom, and another

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.430
depicted a hole in the wall looking through to an idyllic beach scene.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.240
These works were not just art—they were political statements, set

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.920
against one of the most politically charged backdrops in the world.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.880
Now, whether you think it is right for a Bristolian graffiti artist to be weighing in

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:51.030
on these kinds of issues is another question, but what is undeniable is that making

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.100
these kinds of political statements was turning Banksy into a global phenomenon.

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.770
His works began appearing in cities like London, New York,

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.720
and Los Angeles, each one stirring up discussion and debate.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.660
People began to actively seek out his murals, turning them into tourist attractions.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.830
And it raised questions about who owned the art.

00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:22.610
Banksy used other people’s property, their houses, offices and shops,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:28.130
as his canvas, so he didn’t own the art, whoever owned the building did.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.050
And as his fame grew, so did the demand for his work.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.880
People started cutting his murals out of walls and selling them

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.540
at auctions for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pounds.

00:12:42.863 --> 00:12:46.022
This presented a strange contradiction.

00:12:47.182 --> 00:12:54.022
Banksy’s art was meant to be for everyone, accessible on the streets, unfiltered by the art world.

00:12:54.982 --> 00:13:02.152
But as his fame grew, the demand for his work skyrocketed, and pieces that had once been painted

00:13:02.152 --> 00:13:08.324
for free on public walls were being removed, sold, and locked away in private collections.

00:13:09.534 --> 00:13:14.034
Banksy had always criticised the art world for being elitist and overly

00:13:14.034 --> 00:13:18.954
commercialised, yet that very same art world seemed unable to resist him.

00:13:19.674 --> 00:13:23.920
It wasn’t just his art that they wanted—it was his rebelliousness.

00:13:23.961 --> 00:13:25.049
his mystique.

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:29.999
The more he mocked the art establishment, the more it embraced him.

00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:37.919
Banksy, however, seemed to be fully aware of this irony and wasn’t afraid to make fun of it.

00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:46.019
In one episode in 2013, he set up a stall in New York’s Central Park, where

00:13:46.049 --> 00:13:52.609
passers-by could buy original pieces of his work for just $60 a pop, $60 each.

00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:54.469
The catch?

00:13:55.269 --> 00:14:02.499
The stall was unmarked, and the person working there gave no clues about who had created the pieces.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:08.969
Of the tens of thousands of people who walked past that stall, only a

00:14:08.979 --> 00:14:13.909
handful bought anything, unaware that they were walking away with genuine

00:14:13.909 --> 00:14:18.169
Banksy works worth tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars.

00:14:19.489 --> 00:14:26.189
The Central Park stunt wasn’t just a clever joke—it was a perfect demonstration of his philosophy.

00:14:26.812 --> 00:14:30.737
It showed that art’s value is often determined more

00:14:30.767 --> 00:14:34.277
by the name attached to it than by the piece itself.

00:14:35.237 --> 00:14:38.747
Without the brand of “Banksy,” his work was just another

00:14:38.757 --> 00:14:42.252
street vendor’s offering, ignored by most passers-by.

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:47.512
And sometimes, the stunts were even larger in scale.

00:14:48.722 --> 00:14:56.852
In 2015, he unveiled Dismaland, a satirical theme park in Weston-super-Mare, a small seaside

00:14:56.872 --> 00:15:00.992
town in the west of England, quite close to Bristol, where he is thought to have grown up.

00:15:02.342 --> 00:15:08.505
It was advertised as a “bemusement park,” as a "family theme park unsuitable for children".

00:15:09.415 --> 00:15:15.873
Now, just in case you didn’t get the puns there, it is bemusement instead of amusement, and

00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:22.073
it is called “dismaland” because he has swapped “Disney” for “Dismal”, meaning very bad.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:28.280
The park featured sculptures, installations, and pieces from over 50 artists,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.990
but everything about it was designed to feel dystopian and unsettling.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.300
Each element challenged the visitor’s expectations of a traditional theme park.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.900
There was a grim Cinderella’s Castle, complete with a crashed pumpkin carriage

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.970
and paparazzi snapping photos of the wreck, like they did with Princess Diana.

00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:56.290
There was a fake payday loan shop for kids, where children could get an advance on

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:02.310
their pocket money at a 5,000% interest rate, and there were fake security cameras

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:07.780
everywhere, a not-so-obvious criticism of the constant surveillance of the British state.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.520
What’s more, staff members were deliberately unhelpful and rude,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:17.930
as if mocking the forced cheerfulness of traditional theme parks.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.860
And tickets were only £3 for the day, a tiny fraction

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.370
of what it would cost to go to the real Disneyland.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:34.870
It was funny, yes, but it was also a sharp critique of consumer culture, the media, and the police.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.449
Now, that was back in 2015, but Banksy is still active today, people are still

00:16:42.459 --> 00:16:47.139
waking up to find that their walls have been redecorated with a new piece of art.

00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:53.429
Sometimes the messages are obvious; sometimes they are not, with journalists

00:16:53.469 --> 00:16:57.559
rushing to have their say on what Banksy might be trying to tell us.

00:16:58.763 --> 00:17:02.540
In terms of his impact, first and foremost, Banksy has

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.800
completely changed the way we think about street art.

00:17:06.606 --> 00:17:11.660
What was once considered vandalism or graffiti has been redefined as

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:17.102
legitimate art, worthy of public admiration, academic study, and as

00:17:17.102 --> 00:17:21.572
a consequence, eye-wateringly high price tags when sold at auction.

00:17:22.812 --> 00:17:26.372
But much of his art has never been sold or removed

00:17:26.402 --> 00:17:29.402
from its original location; it has remained public.

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:36.857
And by taking art out of the galleries and creating it on the streets, he democratised it.

00:17:37.152 --> 00:17:41.112
Banksy has given art back to the people, creating pieces that

00:17:41.112 --> 00:17:44.912
are free to view, often in places where you’d least expect them.

00:17:45.832 --> 00:17:51.732
His art doesn’t require an understanding of fine art history or a degree in modern art.

00:17:52.002 --> 00:17:56.152
It appeals directly to emotions and common experiences.

00:17:56.322 --> 00:17:58.342
It speaks to people directly.

00:17:59.262 --> 00:18:02.962
Whether you agree with his politics or not, it is easy to

00:18:02.962 --> 00:18:07.866
understand, it’s often funny, it’s clever, and it’s deeply emotional.

00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:10.366
A child reaching for a balloon.

00:18:10.626 --> 00:18:12.676
Young boys searching for freedom.

00:18:13.046 --> 00:18:15.646
A pair of policemen in a tender embrace.

00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:19.556
These are images that anyone can understand, and

00:18:19.776 --> 00:18:22.726
they stick in your mind long after you’ve seen them.

00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:28.036
But Banksy has also sparked debates about what art even is.

00:18:28.646 --> 00:18:34.756
Is it still art if it’s painted illegally, or does its illegality add to its power?

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:38.886
Does art lose its meaning when it’s cut out of a wall and sold at

00:18:38.886 --> 00:18:42.226
auction, when it's done completely against the artist’s wishes?

00:18:43.016 --> 00:18:46.066
Can a shredded painting still be considered valuable?

00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:53.056
These questions don’t have any easy answers, and Banksy seems to enjoy keeping it that way.

00:18:53.736 --> 00:19:00.676
By staying anonymous, he’s shifted the focus away from the artist and back to the art itself.

00:19:01.666 --> 00:19:04.489
Banksy, in many ways, is a paradox.

00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:08.252
He is a famous artist who has chosen to remain anonymous.

00:19:08.512 --> 00:19:13.619
He’s critical of consumerism and capitalism, yet his work works sells for millions.

00:19:14.459 --> 00:19:21.059
He creates art that belongs to the streets, yet it’s often cut out and sold to private collectors.

00:19:22.139 --> 00:19:25.939
And perhaps this paradox is exactly why Banksy is so fascinating.

00:19:26.329 --> 00:19:28.779
He doesn’t fit into any neat categories.

00:19:29.027 --> 00:19:34.249
He refuses to play by the rules, and in doing so, he’s changed the game entirely.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:39.959
So, the next time you see a blank wall, perhaps you’ll wonder if it’s waiting for a Banksy.

00:19:40.769 --> 00:19:45.899
And the next time you see a Banksy, you’ll know it’s much more than just a piece of art.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:50.879
It’s a story, a statement, and maybe even a little bit of a history.

00:19:52.659 --> 00:19:56.199
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Banksy.

00:19:56.489 --> 00:19:59.539
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:20:03.359 --> 00:20:04.989
Had you heard of Banksy before?

00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:07.339
If so, what do you think of him?

00:20:07.719 --> 00:20:12.189
Do you think that street art is as worthy of acclaim and praise as other

00:20:12.189 --> 00:20:16.809
forms of art, and are there similar Banksy-type characters in your country?

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:20.619
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

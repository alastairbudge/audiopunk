Alastair Budge: Hello hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.260
English, where you can improve your English while learning fascinating things about the world.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.150
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.480
I hadn't mentioned anything about the Corona virus so far as, well, you listen to this podcast to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.840
improve your English, not to get any kind of medical advice or commentary that I am in no way

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.890
qualified to give.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.550
So I'm not going to start today, other than to say that I hope you are keeping safe in these

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.360
turbulent times.

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:49.535
Here at the English Learning for Curious Minds podcast we are going to carry on as usual, as much as

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:55.535
is possible, bringing you weird and wonderful stories and helping you improve your English at the

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:56.165
same time.

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.885
The subject of today's podcast is gin.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.180
But before we get right into it, let me just remind those of you listening to this podcast on

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.070
Spotify, Apple Podcasts iVoox or wherever you get your podcasts, that you can get a copy of the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.730
transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.975
The transcript comes in PDF format for you to download.

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:32.915
It's there on the website too, but it also now comes in animating format.

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:40.295
So this is a bit like subtitles, but actually way cooler because you can tap on a word and your

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:43.025
browser should give you the definition of that word.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.270
And the key vocabulary is really useful because less common words are explained, you don't have to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.170
stop to look things up in a dictionary, and it means that you can build up your vocabulary at the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.480
same time as improving your English.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.790
So go and check that out.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.960
That's at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:06.322
Okay, then.

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:08.632
Today let's talk about gin.

00:02:10.022 --> 00:02:18.542
You may now think of it as an ingredient in a fancy cocktail, enjoyed with tonic and fresh lime.

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:27.572
But not so long ago London experienced a gin craze of epic scale.

00:02:29.112 --> 00:02:37.452
It has been called London's gin epidemic, and actually that was the original title for this podcast.

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:46.492
But in light of recent events, it obviously wouldn't be appropriate to talk about it as an epidemic,

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:49.432
so I'll try to avoid using that word.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:56.603
However, it was deemed pretty serious at the time, it was considered a big, big problem.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.030
To give you an idea of quite how much gin Londoners were drinking, the average Londoner, and bear in

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.350
mind that this includes people who didn't drink gin at all, so small children for example, the

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.600
average Londoner was drinking 10 litres of gin per year.

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:28.584
To put that in context, now, the average amount of gin drunk per year is half a litre by Londoners.

00:03:29.064 --> 00:03:35.014
And the biggest gin drinkers in the world, the Spanish, drink one litre.

00:03:36.504 --> 00:03:44.874
So even now, the biggest gin drinkers in the world only drink 1/10th of what Londoners were drinking

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.649
250 years ago.

00:03:48.732 --> 00:03:56.292
So let's find out exactly how this happened and how gin got to this position where Londoners were

00:03:56.292 --> 00:03:58.512
drinking it like it was water.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:07.510
Gin, as you may know, is a spirit, an alcohol, flavoured with juniper berries.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.970
It has been around since the middle ages and arrived in Britain in the 17th century after a Dutch

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.300
liquor called Genever was introduced.

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:30.712
One historian suggested that the reason that 'gin' is called 'gin' was because the British were too

00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:37.042
drunk to pronounce Genever and they just shortened it to gin.

00:04:38.242 --> 00:04:40.882
Anyway, I'll let you be the judge of that.

00:04:41.542 --> 00:04:48.562
Perhaps if you have spent many Friday evenings in British towns, then that might sound like a

00:04:48.562 --> 00:04:49.792
reasonable explanation.

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:58.845
At the time that gin was introduced, most people would drink beer or brandy, and there really wasn't

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:03.295
interest in this new arrival, this new gin.

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:11.886
But there were three events that caused the fate of gin to change and caused it to jump in

00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:12.636
popularity.

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:17.592
Firstly, large taxes on brandy.

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:27.187
Brandy was normally imported from France, and as you may know, Britain was at war with France for

00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:32.617
extended periods during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.

00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:41.641
As a way of punishing the French, King William raised taxes on imported French brandy, making it

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:42.841
much more expensive.

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:50.840
And from a patriotic point of view, people didn't want to drink something made by a Frenchman.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.900
We were at war with them, and it would be very un-English to drink a French drink.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.720
So brandy became expensive and unfashionable.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:13.650
Secondly, to try to encourage domestic production of spirits, and to reduce reliance on the French,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:21.660
the British government allowed unlicensed production of gin, meaning that practically anyone could

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.080
do it.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.743
The result was a boom, a huge increase in the number of people producing gin.

00:06:31.508 --> 00:06:41.108
And the third factor was a reduction, a lowering of the price of food, meaning that even the poor

00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:44.048
now had some extra money in their pockets.

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:53.041
These three factors: the increased taxes on brandy, the relaxing of legislation around production

00:06:53.611 --> 00:07:02.591
and the increased amount of disposable income created the perfect storm for a huge boom in gin

00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:03.211
consumption.

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:07.284
And that is exactly what happened.

00:07:08.844 --> 00:07:18.789
By 1730 it's estimated that there were 7,000 gin shops, which made up half of the drinking

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.259
establishments of London.

00:07:21.317 --> 00:07:23.747
And these were just the legal ones.

00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:27.917
There must have been thousands more illegal gin shops.

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:37.391
And when I say gin shop, if you are thinking of a fancy gin bar with people sitting there sipping

00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:41.051
lovely cocktails, you'd be very much mistaken.

00:07:42.206 --> 00:07:49.766
They were literally just shops, places where you would go and buy a glass of gin, quite often it

00:07:49.766 --> 00:07:57.866
would be warm, you would drink it quickly, and presumably you would emerge completely drunk a matter

00:07:57.866 --> 00:07:58.976
of minutes later.

00:08:00.773 --> 00:08:10.041
The gin itself was pretty horrible stuff, fiendishly strong, very, very strong, and full of horrible

00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:18.981
things like sulphuric acid and turpentine, the kind of thing you use for cleaning paint brushes.

00:08:19.954 --> 00:08:27.749
Not only was it obviously disgusting to taste, to drink, it was incredibly bad for you.

00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:38.302
It made men impotent and made women's sterile, so it made both sexes unable to have children, and

00:08:38.422 --> 00:08:46.102
it's thought that this was a major reason why the birth rate in London at this time was exceeded by

00:08:46.102 --> 00:08:46.852
the death rate.

00:08:47.957 --> 00:08:52.339
It also drove people mad, as we'll talk about in a bit.

00:08:53.647 --> 00:09:00.302
But this didn't stop Londoners from drinking it and it didn't stop the shops from selling it.

00:09:02.097 --> 00:09:11.367
The gin shops sold vast amounts of the stuff, vast amounts of gin, huge amounts, selling almost 50

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:13.887
million litres of gin per year.

00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:24.707
The signs above the shops, reportedly, said 'drunk for a penny, dead drunk for two pennies, clean

00:09:24.707 --> 00:09:26.147
straw for nothing'.

00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:36.442
So just to go over that again, it's that you'll be drunk for one penny, which is approximately 50p

00:09:36.592 --> 00:09:38.602
in today's money, under $1.

00:09:39.682 --> 00:09:46.102
Dead drunk, very drunk for two pennies, so one pound or a dollar and a half.

00:09:47.032 --> 00:09:54.442
Then clean straw for nothing means that you'll be so drunk, you'll just pass out, you'll fall asleep

00:09:54.502 --> 00:09:58.117
onto a straw bed, and you won't have to pay for a bed.

00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:06.676
Remember, life in the 18th century for the majority of people in London was pretty terrible.

00:10:07.616 --> 00:10:15.446
It was cold, wet, and working days were long, dangerous, and monotonous and boring.

00:10:17.326 --> 00:10:24.880
Gin was something that was very cheap, it warmed you up, and I guess it helped you forget your

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.600
situation.

00:10:27.448 --> 00:10:34.524
People have drawn parallels, they've made comparisons with the crack epidemic, the crack cocaine

00:10:34.524 --> 00:10:38.372
epidemic in the 1980s in the US.

00:10:39.354 --> 00:10:47.527
Gin was nicknamed 'mother's ruin' because of the rate at which it ruined, it destroyed women's

00:10:47.527 --> 00:10:48.037
lives.

00:10:49.773 --> 00:10:56.583
The impurities in the gin, the bad things that were going into the gin, plus the rate at which

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:59.883
people were drinking it, it drove people mad.

00:11:00.439 --> 00:11:03.663
They became a hopelessly addicted to the stuff.

00:11:05.693 --> 00:11:14.513
One particularly sad story was of a woman named Judith Defour, and her two year old daughter, Mary.

00:11:16.693 --> 00:11:23.743
Apparently she had such a terrible gin addiction that she was literally driven mad.

00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:28.683
She went with her daughter and a friend into a field.

00:11:29.433 --> 00:11:36.123
They removed the daughter's clothes and they strangled the daughter, they killed the daughter, and

00:11:36.123 --> 00:11:37.443
left her there dead.

00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:42.322
And they went to sell the clothes to buy gin.

00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:47.842
This woman had literally killed her baby for a drink of gin.

00:11:49.263 --> 00:11:57.138
This was a little bit of a wake-up call for Britain, that this gin was causing people to do such

00:11:57.138 --> 00:12:03.348
horrible and desperate things, and the government finally decided to do something about it.

00:12:04.034 --> 00:12:12.944
In 1751 the government passed something called The Gin Act, which raised taxes and made it harder to

00:12:12.944 --> 00:12:13.694
get a licence.

00:12:14.852 --> 00:12:24.114
Alongside this, they promoted drinking beer and tea, and by 1830, nearly 100 years after the death

00:12:24.414 --> 00:12:29.374
of poor little Mary Defour, beer finally became cheaper than gin again.

00:12:30.844 --> 00:12:34.264
So the gin craze was finally over.

00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:42.904
London's gin consumption returned to normal, although I'm sure that if you were to go to a bar on a

00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:48.834
normal Friday night in central London, you might not agree with the statement that Londoners' gin

00:12:48.834 --> 00:12:51.004
consumption is 'normal'.

00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:55.864
In any case, it's a lot less than 10 litres per year.

00:12:56.419 --> 00:13:02.929
And at least people don't seem to be going mad at quite the levels that they were doing 300 years

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:03.229
ago.

00:13:04.277 --> 00:13:12.645
Gin, today, as you may know, is enjoying a bit of a resurgence, it's getting popular again, with

00:13:12.645 --> 00:13:20.115
consumption worldwide growing 13% per year from 2013 to 2018.

00:13:21.164 --> 00:13:25.231
Now though, it's certainly in the premium category.

00:13:26.011 --> 00:13:34.051
I think if you went to a fancy bar and asked for a cup of warm gin for a penny, they might be

00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:35.071
slightly surprised.

00:13:38.027 --> 00:13:44.747
Okay then, I hope that this has been an interesting journey into the time of London's gin craze.

00:13:45.372 --> 00:13:54.372
It's fascinating to think that this really wasn't that long ago and that it had such a strong grip

00:13:54.612 --> 00:13:55.782
on so many people.

00:13:57.822 --> 00:14:04.302
As usual, if you are looking for the transcript and key vocabulary for the podcast, you can get that

00:14:04.332 --> 00:14:07.332

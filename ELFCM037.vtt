Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:09.316 --> 00:00:14.506
English, the show where you can improve your English while learning fascinating things about the

00:00:14.506 --> 00:00:14.806
world.

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:21.001
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about gin.

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:30.121
You may now think of it as an ingredient in a fancy cocktail, enjoyed with tonic and fresh lime.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:38.826
But not so long ago, London experienced a gin epidemic of epic scale.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:48.186
To give you an idea of quite how much gin Londoners were drinking, the average Londoner, and bear in

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:55.626
mind that this includes people who didn't drink gin at all, so children for example, the average

00:00:55.656 --> 00:01:00.621
Londoner was drinking 10 litres of gin per year.

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:10.071
To put that in context, now the average amount of gin drunk per year is half a litre by Londoners

00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:15.891
and the biggest gin drinkers in the world, the Spanish, drink one litre.

00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:25.581
So even now, the biggest gin drinkers in the world only drink 1/10th of what Londoners were drinking

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:26.916
300 years ago.

00:01:29.206 --> 00:01:32.566
Today we are going to tell the story of how that happened.

00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:40.861
Before we get right into it though, this is just your customary reminder for those of you listening

00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:47.851
on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, iVoox or wherever you may choose to get your podcasts, that you can get

00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:54.571
a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast over on the website, which is

00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:55.991
Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:00.481
The transcript comes in PDF format for you to download.

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:06.911
It's there on the website too, but it also now comes in animating format.

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:13.531
So it's a little bit like subtitles, but way cooler because you can tap on a word and your browser

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:14.821
should give you the definition.

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:22.681
And the key vocabulary is really useful because less common words are explained, you don't have to

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:29.476
stop to look things up in a dictionary, and so you can build up your vocabulary at the same time as

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:30.706
listening to the podcast.

00:02:31.486 --> 00:02:33.166
So go and check that out.

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:35.396
It's at Leonardoenglish.com.

00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:39.266
Okay then, gin.

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:49.636
Nowadays, as we said, it's a pretty fancy drink served in high glasses with lots of ice, lemon or

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:50.386
lime.

00:02:50.776 --> 00:02:57.678
A refreshing way to start off an evening or a sophisticated drink you might enjoy at a cocktail bar.

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.429
But this is a relatively new phenomenon, a new phenomenon indeed.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:12.074
Gin has a fascinating history in Britain, and it's certainly a very different drink to what you may

00:03:12.074 --> 00:03:13.544
be familiar with today.

00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:21.164
Gin, as you may know, is a spirit flavoured with Juniper berries.

00:03:22.214 --> 00:03:30.614
It's been around since the middle ages, or at least some variant of it has, but it arrived in

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:40.184
Britain in the 17th century after it was introduced by the Dutch who brought over a liquor called

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:41.074
‘Jenever’.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:50.939
One historian suggested that the reason that gin is called 'gin' was because the British were too

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:56.139
drunk to pronounce 'Jenever', and so just shortened it to gin.

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.239
Anyway, I'll let you make up your own mind as to what you think.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.259
Perhaps if you've spent many Friday evenings in British towns then that does sound like a reasonable

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.979
explanation.

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:17.129
At the time that gin was introduced, most people would drink beer or brandy and there really just

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:21.469
wasn't much interest in this new arrival, this new gin.

00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:30.944
But there were three events that caused the fate of gin to change and caused it to jump in

00:04:30.944 --> 00:04:31.754
popularity.

00:04:33.664 --> 00:04:36.994
Firstly, large taxes on brandy.

00:04:38.844 --> 00:04:46.584
Brandy was normally imported from France, and as you may know, Britain was at war with France for

00:04:46.614 --> 00:04:52.314
extended periods during the 16th, 17th and 18th century.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:05:02.584
As a way of punishing the French, King William raised taxes on imported French brandy, making it

00:05:02.584 --> 00:05:03.874
much more expensive.

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:11.474
And from a patriotic point of view, people didn't want to drink something made by the French.

00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:18.104
We were at war with the French and it would be very un-English to drink a French drink.

00:05:19.274 --> 00:05:23.474
So brandy became expensive and unfashionable.

00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:34.859
Secondly, to try to encourage domestic production of spirits and to reduce reliance on the French,

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:42.089
the British government allowed unlicensed production of gin, meaning that anyone could do it.

00:05:43.658 --> 00:05:48.980
The result was a boom, a huge increase in the number of people producing gin.

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:59.945
And the third factor was a reduction, a lowering in food prices, meaning that now even the poorest

00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:03.665
of society had some extra money in their pockets.

00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:13.285
These three factors: the increased taxes on brandy, the relaxing of legislation around production,

00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:21.705
and the increased amount of disposable income created the perfect storm for a huge boom in gin

00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:22.275
drinking.

00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:25.177
And that's exactly what happened.

00:06:26.017 --> 00:06:34.987
By the year 1730 it's estimated that there were 7,000 gin shops which made up half of the drinking

00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:36.427
establishments of London.

00:06:38.187 --> 00:06:40.647
And these were just the legal ones.

00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:43.917
There must have been thousands more illegal ones.

00:06:46.102 --> 00:06:53.722
And if you are thinking of a fancy gin bar with people sitting there sipping lovely cocktails, you'd

00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:55.492
be very much mistaken.

00:06:56.692 --> 00:07:03.862
They were literally just shops, places where you would go and buy a glass of gin, drink it quickly,

00:07:03.862 --> 00:07:08.362
and presumably emerge completely drunk a matter of minutes later.

00:07:09.982 --> 00:07:18.822
The gin was also pretty horrible stuff, fiendishly strong, very, very strong and full of horrible

00:07:18.822 --> 00:07:27.436
things like sulphuric acid and turpentine, the liquid that you use for cleaning paintbrushes.

00:07:28.872 --> 00:07:35.352
Not only was it obviously disgusting to taste, it was incredibly bad for you to drink.

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:45.072
It made men impotent and made women sterile, so made both sexes unable to have children, and it's

00:07:45.072 --> 00:07:54.312
thought that gin was a major reason why the birth rate in London at this time was exceeded by the

00:07:54.312 --> 00:07:56.982
death rate - that more people died than were born.

00:07:58.056 --> 00:08:02.177
And it also drove people mad, as we'll talk about in a bit.

00:08:03.827 --> 00:08:09.887
But this didn't stop Londoners from drinking it and it didn't stop the shops from selling it.

00:08:11.095 --> 00:08:20.408
The gin shops sold vast amounts of the stuff, vast amounts of gin selling almost 50 million litres

00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:21.568
of gin per year.

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:32.479
The signs above the shops reportedly said "drunk for a penny, dead drunk for two pennies, clean

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:33.769
straw for nothing".

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:43.739
So just to go over that again, it's that you'll be drunk for one penny, which is approximately 50p

00:08:43.764 --> 00:08:45.744
in today's money, under $1.

00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:52.944
Dead drunk, very drunk, for two pennies, so for one pound or a dollar and a half.

00:08:53.904 --> 00:09:00.894
Then clean straw for nothing means that you'll be so drunk that you'll just pass out, you'll fall

00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:04.224
asleep onto a straw bed and you won't have to pay for a bed.

00:09:06.349 --> 00:09:13.628
Remember, life in the 18th century for the majority of people in London was pretty terrible.

00:09:14.318 --> 00:09:21.188
It was cold, wet, and working days were long, dangerous, monotonous, and boring.

00:09:22.488 --> 00:09:29.358
Gin was something that was very cheap, warmed you up and helped you forget your situation.

00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:39.343
People have drawn parallels with the crack epidemic, the crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s in the

00:09:39.343 --> 00:09:39.683
US.

00:09:40.937 --> 00:09:48.404
And gin was nicknamed 'mother's ruin' because of the rates at which it ruined, it destroyed women's

00:09:48.404 --> 00:09:48.944
lives.

00:09:50.502 --> 00:09:56.684
The impurities in the gin, all the horrible stuff they were putting in it, plus the rate at which

00:09:56.684 --> 00:09:59.924
people were drinking it drove people mad.

00:10:00.464 --> 00:10:03.374
They became hopelessly addicted to the stuff.

00:10:05.144 --> 00:10:13.814
One particularly sad story was of a woman named Judith Defour and her two year old daughter Mary.

00:10:16.034 --> 00:10:24.134
Apparently Judith had such a terrible gin addiction that she was driven literally mad.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:33.469
She went with her daughter and a friend into a field, she removed the daughter's clothes and killed

00:10:33.469 --> 00:10:35.529
her, and left her there dead.

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:40.359
She then went to sell the clothes to buy gin.

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:44.819
She had literally killed her baby for a drink of gin.

00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:54.026
This was a bit of a wake-up call for Britain, that this gin was causing people to do such horrible

00:10:54.026 --> 00:10:59.576
and desperate things, and the government finally decided to do something about it.

00:11:01.926 --> 00:11:11.046
In 1751 the government passed something called The Gin Act, which raised taxes and made it harder to

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:11.796
get a license.

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:18.486
And alongside this they promoted drinking beer and tea.

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:28.451
And by 1830, nearly a hundred years after the death of poor, little Mary Defour, beer finally became

00:11:28.451 --> 00:11:29.591
cheaper than gin again.

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:35.071
So the gin epidemic was finally over.

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:43.462
London's gin consumption returned to normal, although I'm sure that if you were to go to a bar, even

00:11:43.462 --> 00:11:49.042
now on a Friday night in central London, you might not agree with the statement that Londoners' gin

00:11:49.092 --> 00:11:50.982
consumption is normal.

00:11:52.272 --> 00:11:58.332
In any case, it's a lot less than 10 litres per year, and at least people don't seem to be going mad

00:11:58.812 --> 00:12:02.252
at quite the levels that they were 300 years ago.

00:12:04.332 --> 00:12:12.602
Gin today, as you may know, is enjoying a bit of a resurgence, it's becoming fashionable again, with

00:12:12.692 --> 00:12:20.282
consumption worldwide growing 13% per year from 2013 to 2018.

00:12:21.103 --> 00:12:24.978
Now though, it's certainly in the premium category.

00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:32.868
I think if you went to a fancy bar and asked for a cup of warm gin, well, they might be slightly

00:12:32.868 --> 00:12:33.438
surprised.

00:12:35.598 --> 00:12:42.288
Okay then I hope that this has been an interesting journey into the time of London's gin craze.

00:12:42.798 --> 00:12:50.268
It's fascinating to think that this really wasn't that long ago, and that it really had such a

00:12:50.368 --> 00:12:54.168
strong hold, such a tight grip, on so many people.

00:12:56.508 --> 00:13:01.428

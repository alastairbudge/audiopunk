Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.490
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.760
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:28.210
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Humour, and What Makes Us Laugh.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.820
It’s a topic that we can all relate to, everyone laughs, it’s one of the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.300
things that separates humans from almost every other creature on the planet.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.090
Yet what actually makes us laugh is complicated, it’s

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.190
not obvious, and we still don’t fully understand it.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.220
So, what we are going to do in today’s episode is talk about

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.140
the science of laughter, of what actually happens when we laugh.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.490
We’ll then talk about the theories of humour, and laughter, and

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.340
some of the ideas throughout the years about why people laugh.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.620
Then we’ll end by talking very briefly about the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.970
British sense of humour, which is certainly different.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.920
If you do want to learn more about the British sense of humour then I would recommend

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.190
checking out episode number 60, which is only on the British sense of humour.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.890
That’s well worth a listen if you haven’t done so already.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.920
OK then, humour and laughter.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.470
It goes without saying that what we find funny, what makes us laugh,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.960
varies by age, culture, personality and thousands of different things.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.800
We are all different, and what I find funny might not be funny to you.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.240
Worse, it might be offensive, hard to understand, or just not funny at all.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.960
But regardless of who we are and where we come from, humans laugh, it’s an instinctive reaction.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.170
Babies laugh way before they start making anything resembling speech, way before they start talking.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.280
People who are deaf, people who cannot hear, they laugh,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.210
even if they have never heard anyone else laughing.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.800
And we laugh, normally, because we find something funny.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.920
It’s not the only occasion that we laugh–indeed laughing in some cultures

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.020
happens when someone is nervous or embarrassed, or you might see a James

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.370
Bond villain laughing because they have just done something terribly evil.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.910
But for the most part, and in most Western cultures, we laugh when we find

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.960
something funny, so that is going to be the focus of our attention today.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.630
So, we all know what a laugh sounds like.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.554
We all laugh in slightly different ways, but generally it’s a sound

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:55.474
that comes from deep within us, that we don’t have full control over.

00:02:56.474 --> 00:03:01.844
Indeed, the part of the brain that controls laughter is located deep

00:03:02.054 --> 00:03:06.814
in an area of the brain called the subcortex, which is the part of

00:03:06.814 --> 00:03:12.294
the brain responsible for basic, instinctive, involuntary reflexes.

00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:17.384
This is one of the reasons that controlling laughter is hard.

00:03:18.404 --> 00:03:24.414
Especially for young children, if they find something funny they struggle to control

00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:28.974
their laughter, even if they know it’s inappropriate, that they shouldn't be laughing.

00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:35.724
It’s such a basic, instinctive reaction that it’s hard to control if our brain

00:03:35.724 --> 00:03:42.864
is telling us to laugh, and similarly it’s hard to convincingly fake, it’s hard

00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:47.654
to pretend to laugh, if our brains are telling us that we should be laughing.

00:03:48.704 --> 00:03:53.274
This instinctive nature of laughter, and of humour, has

00:03:53.294 --> 00:03:57.274
puzzled philosophers and psychologists since the dawn of time.

00:03:58.304 --> 00:03:59.854
Why is something funny?

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:02.264
What makes someone laugh?

00:04:03.524 --> 00:04:08.264
For the ancient Greeks, humour and laughter often came

00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:12.234
from feeling superior, feeling better than other people.

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:17.544
An example of an Ancient Greek joke was, apparently:

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:21.594
“An idiot, wanting to go to sleep but not having a pillow,

00:04:21.984 --> 00:04:26.804
told his slave to set a jar, a container, under his head.

00:04:27.694 --> 00:04:30.394
The slave said that the jug was hard.

00:04:30.994 --> 00:04:33.074
The idiot told him to fill it with feathers.”

00:04:34.424 --> 00:04:35.234
Hahahah.

00:04:35.414 --> 00:04:40.714
So, not so different to the sort of joke that we might tell each other today, right?

00:04:41.794 --> 00:04:46.129
And that’s one of the funny things about humour, it's that there

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.143
are some inherently human consistencies about what makes us laugh.

00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:56.033
We might think that we are completely different to someone living in

00:04:56.253 --> 00:05:01.623
Ancient Rome 2000 years ago, or even someone now living in a completely

00:05:01.623 --> 00:05:06.013
different culture to us, but a lot of the same things make us laugh.

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:14.003
A 15 month-old child is probably going to laugh at an adult falling over unexpectedly, whether

00:05:14.053 --> 00:05:21.353
that child is my child and is alive in 2021 in Europe, whether it's a child that lived 1000

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:28.093
years ago in the Amazon rainforest, or is a child that lived 5000 years ago in Ancient Egypt.

00:05:29.393 --> 00:05:34.303
As we grow up, our cultural environment might influence what we find

00:05:34.303 --> 00:05:39.583
funny, it might change what makes us laugh, but there are some theories

00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:44.763
about humour, about laughter, that are believed to be inherently human.

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:52.663
And when it comes to the theory of humour, of what makes us laugh, there are three main theories.

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:59.863
The first theory of humour, about what makes us laugh is called the Incongruity Theory.

00:06:00.813 --> 00:06:05.513
If something is incongruous, it means that it’s not in harmony

00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:10.203
with everything else, it’s in a place you wouldn’t expect it.

00:06:10.293 --> 00:06:16.303
And the Incongruity Theory suggests that one reason we find something funny is

00:06:16.303 --> 00:06:21.773
when something that we expect to happen is replaced by something unexpected.

00:06:23.123 --> 00:06:28.253
If you’re listening to someone telling a joke, you are following along with a story.

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:33.303
Your own experience tells you what is likely to happen in that

00:06:33.303 --> 00:06:38.453
story, or at least informs you of a few possible scenarios.

00:06:39.713 --> 00:06:44.643
But if something completely unexpected happens, it’s funny, and you laugh.

00:06:46.153 --> 00:06:52.733
The theory goes that it’s these two different thoughts that make us laugh, that we experience

00:06:52.763 --> 00:06:59.833
this mismatch between what we thought was going to happen and what actually happens, and

00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:06.173
that triggers this laughter reaction, or at least makes us think that something is funny.

00:07:07.453 --> 00:07:11.563
Here’s an example of this in action in a joke that I quite like..

00:07:12.743 --> 00:07:16.873
“There was a little boy who had never spoken a word in his entire life.

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:23.733
One day, while having dinner, out of the blue he said, "The pasta is disgusting."

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.577
When the parents heard what their son had just said, they looked at each other full of

00:07:29.577 --> 00:07:35.317
surprise, then turned to the boy and asked, "How come you never said anything before?"

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:40.527
Their son replied, "Well, so far the food you’ve given me has been pretty good."

00:07:41.797 --> 00:07:44.857
So, hahah, maybe you found that funny, maybe you didn’t.

00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:52.707
The point is that it’s unexpected, and the fact that we’re trying to reconcile our expectations

00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:58.407
about what we thought would happen with what actually does happen is what makes us laugh.

00:07:59.807 --> 00:08:03.911
Our second theory of humour is called the Superiority Theory.

00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:11.281
Now, if you feel superior to someone, you feel like you are above them, you’re better than them.

00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:18.431
And the Superiority Theory revolves around the idea of laughing at people, often

00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:25.121
unfortunately using stereotypes of nationality, where someone is from, age and so on.

00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:31.981
I’m sure this doesn’t need much more explanation, but when kids laugh at someone falling

00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:37.861
over, this is partly that they feel superior to the adult who has done something silly.

00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:43.981
When we laugh at someone doing something stupid in a joke, or suffering some

00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:49.601
kind of misfortune, it’s because we feel superior, so the theory goes at least.

00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:55.811
An interesting part of the superiority theory is the extent to which,

00:08:56.021 --> 00:09:01.481
culturally, our proximity to the event changes how funny it is considered.

00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:09.321
What I mean by this is depending on the culture you come from, and the type of humour that is

00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:16.041
considered acceptable, people are more able to laugh about certain things if they are very removed

00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:22.071
from them, either in terms of geography or in terms of time, if they happened a long time ago.

00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:30.541
To give you a practical example, if there was some sort of tragic event, it’s very unlikely that it

00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:36.911
would ever be considered acceptable to laugh about it on the day that it happened, or shortly after.

00:09:37.941 --> 00:09:43.451
But slowly slowly, as time went on, it might become acceptable in some

00:09:43.451 --> 00:09:48.171
cultures to use humour to talk about it, as a way of coping with it.

00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:55.021
British humour is especially guilty of this, and you’ll find that people in Britain are

00:09:55.021 --> 00:10:01.131
likely to laugh about things that people in other countries would find very unacceptable.

00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:08.721
And the final of the three most prominent theories of humour is called The Relief Theory.

00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:17.951
The Relief Theory dates back to the 18th century, in 1709, and was written by an English

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:24.391
Philosopher called Anthony Ashley-Cooper, otherwise known as the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury.

00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:28.991
It was later developed by Sigmund Freud in the early 20th

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:32.771
century, but it actually comes from around 200 years earlier.

00:10:34.091 --> 00:10:40.811
The idea of The Relief Theory is that laughter allows us to release energy

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:45.941
and pent-up emotions, emotions that we had been storing up inside us.

00:10:47.051 --> 00:10:52.731
It’s been adapted a little bit since it was first proposed, but the general idea is

00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:59.381
that tension can be built up artificially by the story of a joke, or in a film or

00:10:59.411 --> 00:11:05.911
TV series, then there is a funny ending, where we laugh and release our emotions.

00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:13.901
It’s also the idea that we store up tension inside us, and if there’s a joke, often

00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:20.261
a rude joke it allows us to release this tension, and be relieved of this pressure.

00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:26.601
I should point out that most serious philosophers of humour, and theorists

00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:31.721
of laughter, tend to ignore The Relief Theory, but it still persists.

00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:39.891
So, these are three of the most common explanations for why we laugh - because we experience

00:11:39.901 --> 00:11:46.361
something unexpected, something incongruous, because we feel superior to someone else, because

00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:53.261
we laugh at their misfortune and finally because of some release of built up emotions and energy.

00:11:55.081 --> 00:12:00.241
Before moving on to British humour, it’s worth pointing out briefly the difference

00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:05.541
between humour and laughing, because they are evidently not exactly the same.

00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:11.541
We laugh when we find something funny, but if we find something funny we don’t always laugh.

00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:17.311
There’s been a huge amount written on this, and the function that laughter plays,

00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:22.151
why we actually laugh in some humorous situations and why we don’t in others.

00:12:23.391 --> 00:12:29.471
One theory goes that laughter is a way of enhancing social connection, of bonding with others.

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:35.071
When you share a joke with someone, and laugh at the same time, it’s

00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:39.171
an intimate experience that helps bring you both closer together.

00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:46.841
Laughter is of course a social activity, and indeed there was a study from the University

00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:52.321
of Maryland that suggested that we laugh 30 times more in the company of others.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:57.191
No doubt you experience this yourself - if you are watching a film,

00:12:57.501 --> 00:13:01.251
you are  more likely to find yourself laughing out loud if you are

00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:04.821
with other people than if you are just watching it on your own.

00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:10.986
Meanwhile in a book called Phantoms in the Brain, which was written by a top

00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:16.541
neuroscientist and a New York Times science writer it was proposed that laughter

00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:21.601
is our way of indicating to people around us that there’s nothing to worry about.

00:13:22.861 --> 00:13:27.091
As we heard through the Incongruity Theory, we laugh because we see

00:13:27.091 --> 00:13:31.981
something we don’t expect, and it’s exactly this laughter that signals

00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:35.911
to the group that this unexpected thing is nothing to worry about.

00:13:37.091 --> 00:13:43.301
So, these are some of the main theories about what makes us laugh, about what makes something funny.

00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:46.921
And I said that we would talk a little bit about

00:13:46.921 --> 00:13:49.751
the British sense of humour, so let’s end with that.

00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:53.741
Again, if you want to know all about the British sense of humour,

00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:58.241
then you should listen to Episode 60, but here is a little taster.

00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:05.021
For those of you who have spent time in Britain, or who live in Britain, you’ll have noticed

00:14:05.031 --> 00:14:10.581
that British humour is particular, it’s very different to the humour in most other countries.

00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:14.661
Firstly, Brits love to laugh at themselves.

00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:18.461
We put ourselves down, we talk about how hopeless we

00:14:18.461 --> 00:14:22.391
are, we are very happy to laugh at our own misfortunes.

00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:28.531
That’s certainly a sort of humour that you would rarely find in somewhere like the US, for example.

00:14:29.864 --> 00:14:32.934
If you watch any of the standup comedy of someone like

00:14:32.964 --> 00:14:36.394
Ricky Gervais, it’s full of him putting himself down.

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:42.744
Secondly, Brits are masters of a type of joke delivery called deadpan.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:49.794
In many other cultures it’s acceptable, or even expected for someone telling a

00:14:49.814 --> 00:14:54.524
joke that they get excited with their audience, and they laugh along with them.

00:14:55.754 --> 00:15:01.334
In British humour, this isn’t generally considered funny, and instead the person

00:15:01.384 --> 00:15:06.734
telling the joke should remain completely calm, and deliver the punchline, the

00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:12.684
funny, incongruous part in exactly the same tone of voice as the rest of the joke.

00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:20.584
If you want to see some deadpan comedy in action, then you’ll see it in Monty Python or Blackadder.

00:15:21.654 --> 00:15:25.374
And our final part of British humour to mention is satire.

00:15:25.984 --> 00:15:30.314
Satire revolves around criticising people or ideas in a

00:15:30.314 --> 00:15:34.714
clever, funny way, especially people in positions of power.

00:15:35.674 --> 00:15:41.964
Brits love to laugh at people in positions of authority, and there are entire genres of

00:15:41.984 --> 00:15:47.594
British comedy based around laughing at prime ministers, government officials, and so on.

00:15:48.754 --> 00:15:53.154
This type of humour can be explained partly through the Incongruity Theory

00:15:53.194 --> 00:15:58.304
and partly through the Superiority Theory - we expect people in positions

00:15:58.314 --> 00:16:02.584
of authority to be clever and without the same flaws as normal people.

00:16:03.364 --> 00:16:04.344
But they aren’t.

00:16:04.724 --> 00:16:08.474
So we therefore feel surprised and superior.

00:16:09.744 --> 00:16:13.114
And if you are looking for satire, then you will enjoy

00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:16.794
things like Yes Minister, or the magazine Private Eye.

00:16:17.724 --> 00:16:23.234
Now, although this episode was meant to be about What Makes Us Laugh, it hasn’t been very funny.

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:27.434
So let’s at least try and do something about that, and end

00:16:27.444 --> 00:16:30.844
with a little joke along the theme of the English language.

00:16:32.334 --> 00:16:37.724
The teacher asks, "Alastair, what is the past participle of the verb to ring?"

00:16:39.184 --> 00:16:42.034
Alastair says, "What do you think it is, Sir?"

00:16:43.244 --> 00:16:46.544
The teacher replies, "I don't think, I KNOW!"

00:16:47.554 --> 00:16:50.824
Alastair replies, "I don't think I know either, Sir!"

00:16:54.274 --> 00:16:58.444
OK then, that is it for today's episode on What Makes Us Laugh.

00:16:58.984 --> 00:17:03.644
If you didn’t find it funny in the slightest, that’s ok, as long as you learnt something new.

00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:08.274
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:17:08.714 --> 00:17:09.664
What makes you laugh?

00:17:10.054 --> 00:17:12.984
How is humour in your country and culture different?

00:17:13.474 --> 00:17:15.624
And of course, what’s your favourite joke?

00:17:16.474 --> 00:17:19.289

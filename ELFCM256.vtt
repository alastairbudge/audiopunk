Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:17.314
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:21.814
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:28.464
I'm Alastair Budge, and this episode is going to be released on April 22nd,

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:33.584
Earth Day, a day when we think about this wonderful planet we all live on.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:39.094
So, the theme of today’s episode is going to be rubbish.

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:43.524
That’s right — rubbish, trash, junk, waste.

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:50.144
Specifically, what actually happens to it after the rubbish truck comes to take it away?

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.511
OK then, let’s talk about rubbish.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:01:00.291
One thing that unites every human being on Earth is

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:04.261
that we are all responsible for some sort of rubbish.

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:09.151
Whether you are rich or poor, whether you live in the desert, the

00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:14.581
countryside, or in a big city, we all create some sort of waste.

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:19.851
Of course, not every country produces the same amount of rubbish.

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:26.933
On a per-person basis, Iceland actually produces the most waste of any country in

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:35.432
the world, at 4.5 kilos per person per day,  or 1.6 tonnes a year— that’s a small

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:41.712
elephant worth of rubbish every year for every man, woman and child living in Iceland.

00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:47.482
The average person in Lesotho, on the other hand, produces just

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:54.452
110g per day, just 2.4% of what someone in Iceland produces.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:02:01.632
And, in general, for all the talk about going green and recycling,

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:06.742
the richer a country is, the more waste each person in it produces.

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:13.652
Indeed, of the 2 billion tonnes of rubbish produced every year, 34

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:18.802
percent is produced by only 16 percent of the world’s population.

00:02:19.782 --> 00:02:25.552
This might be sad, but it is unsurprising, when you think about the fact that

00:02:25.552 --> 00:02:31.872
rubbish production throughout history is correlated with the development of society.

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:37.712
As societies develop, they make more, which means there is more to throw away.

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:43.952
If you were a caveman, living tens of thousands of years ago, you still

00:02:43.952 --> 00:02:48.872
produced rubbish but the odds are that you didn’t worry too much about it.

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:53.842
You might produce some “food waste” from the bits of animals

00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:58.662
that you cannot eat or turn into tools, but that was about it.

00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:04.172
Rubbish disposal likely consisted of throwing a piece of animal

00:03:04.182 --> 00:03:08.422
bones outside your cave and you wouldn’t think twice about it.

00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:15.922
Perhaps it would be eaten by a nearby wolf or fox, or it would simply decay.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:22.292
You knew not to leave the decaying corpse of a deer right outside your cave,

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:27.842
because it would smell horrible and attract unwanted visitors, but that was

00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:33.162
probably the extent of how much you needed to worry about disposing of rubbish.

00:03:34.092 --> 00:03:40.162
But over thousands of years, as we humans figured out how to produce more and more,

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:46.302
and we started living together in increasingly urban environments, the amount of

00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:52.422
waste we produced, and the nature of that waste started to look quite different.

00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:56.842
And you might be thinking that this was purely a

00:03:57.012 --> 00:04:01.652
modern, post-Industrial problem, but it’s certainly not.

00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:06.998
The first ever people to dump rubbish into large holes dug

00:04:07.018 --> 00:04:12.518
in the ground were in Knossos, in Crete, back in 3,000 B.C.

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:17.338
Once the rubbish pits were full, they were covered up with earth

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:22.188
to protect them from attracting vermin and producing foul smells.

00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:31.498
Later, in around 500 B.C, the leaders of Athens in Greece started to dispose of rubbish at least

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:38.898
one mile away from the city so invaders couldn’t use piles of rubbish to climb over the city walls.

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:46.858
And you probably know that Rome has 7 hills, but you might not know that there’s another

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:54.868
one in southern Rome called Monte Testaccio, which is thought to contain up to 50 million

00:04:55.148 --> 00:05:02.278
broken olive oil amphorae, the clay containers used to hold olive oil in Roman times.

00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:07.888
So, the problem of what to do with rubbish is really as

00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:12.338
old as civilisation, or at least urbanisation itself.

00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:19.478
And throughout history, including the present day, there have really been four broad

00:05:19.508 --> 00:05:25.028
categories of things you can do to rubbish, to anything that you no longer need.

00:05:26.408 --> 00:05:31.018
It can be buried in the ground, so that it either decomposes

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:34.888
over time or simply remains there, hidden from view.

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:40.378
It can be put into rivers and ultimately washed out to sea.

00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:45.878
It can be burned, incinerated, so that it literally no longer exists.

00:05:46.538 --> 00:05:52.848
Or it can be reused for another purpose - whether that’s recycled, repaired,

00:05:52.878 --> 00:05:59.728
or in the case of food or human waste, used as fertiliser, to grow new crops.

00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:06.428
So, to try to answer the question of “where does all of our rubbish go”, let’s take

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:12.498
a look at what a typical person might throw away on a typical day, and see where

00:06:12.508 --> 00:06:19.198
modern rubbish ends up in this categorisation of four different final destinations.

00:06:20.548 --> 00:06:25.778
Of course, there is no typical person, what you throw away is different from

00:06:25.778 --> 00:06:31.178
what I throw away, and every country deals with its rubbish slightly differently.

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:36.428
But, for the sake of this exercise, let’s take the example of

00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:41.378
the average person in the UK, let’s even give him a name, Frank.

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:48.998
Over the course of a day, Frank throws away a little over 1 kilo of rubbish.

00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:54.388
About a quarter of that is food, and the rest breaks down

00:06:54.408 --> 00:07:00.028
into things like plastics, paper, glass, tins and electronics.

00:07:00.778 --> 00:07:05.968
Frank is a good, law-abiding citizen, and he has separate rubbish

00:07:06.188 --> 00:07:10.358
bins for his mixed waste, his food waste, and his recycling.

00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:16.888
He puts everything into the right bin, takes it out to the side of the road on the appropriate

00:07:16.888 --> 00:07:23.468
day, the rubbish truck comes along and that’s the last Frank thinks about his rubbish.

00:07:24.328 --> 00:07:26.578
But what actually happens?

00:07:27.158 --> 00:07:31.918
Well, Frank’s mixed waste, his general rubbish, is probably

00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:36.998
taken either to a landfill or it’s incinerated, it’s burned.

00:07:37.668 --> 00:07:43.508
Things haven’t really changed all that much since Knossos in ancient Crete, and

00:07:43.808 --> 00:07:49.998
around a quarter of all the waste produced in the UK is simply buried in the ground.

00:07:50.878 --> 00:07:57.208
Sure, landfills have become more regulated, and they are typically lined to stop

00:07:57.338 --> 00:08:02.728
hazardous liquids getting out and entering the ground, but the general concept is

00:08:03.048 --> 00:08:08.568
pretty simple: there’s a big hole that’s dug into the ground, rubbish is put in there

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:14.558
and when it's full, the entire thing is closed so we don’t have to see it any more.

00:08:15.628 --> 00:08:21.438
There’s a phrase in English which is “out of sight, out of mind”, meaning if

00:08:21.438 --> 00:08:26.768
you can’t see something you don’t think about it, and there is probably no more

00:08:26.778 --> 00:08:32.238
appropriate use for it than our attitude towards burying rubbish in landfills.

00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:37.648
Another potential destination for this mixed waste is the

00:08:37.688 --> 00:08:42.598
incinerator, where it is burned and turned into electricity.

00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:50.978
In the UK it’s a relatively small amount, around 5%, but in places such

00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:57.628
as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark up to 50% of all rubbish is incinerated.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.780
Now, there’s an interesting debate on the pros and cons of

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.600
incineration, of burning rubbish, instead of sending it to landfill.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.970
Proponents of incineration, of burning, say that it’s actually better for the

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:20.310
environment, because it produces energy and eliminates or at least reduces the

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:25.220
carbon emissions that would have come from transporting the rubbish to a landfill.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.960
The actual incineration process is now advanced, safe, and harmful

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.580
fumes are typically caught before they are released into the atmosphere.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.870
Plus, leaving rubbish in a landfill often causes methane to be

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.770
released, and incineration fixes this because methane isn’t released.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:55.980
But incineration is, of course, not an ideal solution - it requires large expensive plants,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:01.530
can cause air pollution, and if people think that they don’t have to care about their

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:08.300
rubbish because it will simply be burned and turned back into useful electricity then they

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:14.510
will stop caring about using less in the first place, and reusing or recycling their waste.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:20.110
And this brings us very nicely on to our next point, the big

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.880
green bin that Frank has in his house with a recycling symbol.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.580
Frank might think of himself as an environmentally conscious person.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:36.580
He reuses plastic bags, perhaps he says no to plastic straws in

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.890
restaurants, he tries to cycle everywhere and he drinks water from the tap.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.470
But he likes yoghurt for his breakfast, he gets a copy of the newspaper

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:52.140
delivered every morning, he likes tinned baked beans on toast [he

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.950
is British after all], and he enjoys the occasional bottle of wine.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:05.390
No problem, Frank thinks, plastic, paper, tins, cans, and glass, it all gets recycled anyway.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:13.510
So, Frank throws the yoghurt pot, the newspaper, the tins and the glass all into the recycling bin.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:19.690
Perhaps there are different recycling bins, but it’s always a bit confusing to Frank.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.520
Does he need to take the lid off the yoghurt pot?

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.670
And what about if there’s a metal cap on the glass wine

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.690
bottle - does he take that out and put it in with the tin?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.320
Frank does his best, and at the end of the day it’s

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.120
all taken away when the rubbish collectors arrive.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:42.220
But what happens to his recycling?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.070
Well, before we get into exactly where Frank’s recycling

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.200
goes, let me add that recycling is actually nothing new.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.720
People have been recycling in some way or another for millennia; in

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:03.360
fact, evidence dating back to the Chinese Bronze Age — roughly 2000 B.C.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:07.450
— shows that the Chinese were already recycling metal.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.060
This wasn’t out of any great care for the environment - it simply made sense.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.150
It was cheaper to re-use than to make from scratch.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.150
And until it became cheaper to make products from scratch

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.720
than to re-use them, recycling and reuse was the norm.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:35.540
In the 19th century, one of the main ways people recycled was via someone called the

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.490
‘rag-and-bone-man’ — a man who would go door-to-door and collect rubbish, especially

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:47.970
metal, cloth, and bone, to sell to merchants who would reuse these materials.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:53.980
During World War II, materials like nylon and tin cans were

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.360
collected and recycled into things like bombs and ammunition.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.410
But as the cost of production of goods continued to decrease,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:09.370
there was less and less of an incentive to reuse and recycle.

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:14.423
And at the same time, developed countries produced more and more.

00:13:15.523 --> 00:13:22.873
With the 1950s and 1960s came the arrival of “throwaway culture”, with companies advertising

00:13:22.893 --> 00:13:28.713
single-use knives and forks to be used at home, so that there was no washing up to be done.

00:13:29.763 --> 00:13:34.733
And this brings us to where we are today, with Frank and his recycling bin.

00:13:35.693 --> 00:13:43.093
Frank might think that his recycling all goes off to a nice plant nearby and it’s all reused

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:49.343
and turned into more yoghurt pots, more newspapers, baked bean tins and bottles for his

00:13:49.383 --> 00:13:55.523
favourite Shiraz, but if he really followed his recycling he would likely be disappointed.

00:13:56.703 --> 00:14:03.523
In the UK there is a large incentive for recycling to be sent abroad, to be exported.

00:14:04.303 --> 00:14:08.163
Once it is exported, it’s meant to be recycled, but

00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:11.893
there are very few checks on what actually happens to it.

00:14:12.623 --> 00:14:15.663
And the UK isn’t really an exception here.

00:14:16.343 --> 00:14:21.453
Indeed, if we are talking about Frank’s yoghurt pot, and plastics in general,

00:14:21.813 --> 00:14:28.533
it’s estimated that only 14% of all plastic waste is actually recycled.

00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:38.893
About 14% of it is burnt, 40% goes into a landfill and the remainder, a third of all plastic

00:14:38.893 --> 00:14:44.933
waste, pollutes the environment, going into rivers, and ultimately being washed into the sea.

00:14:46.363 --> 00:14:50.953
Why, you might ask, are we so bad at actually recycling plastic?

00:14:51.643 --> 00:14:58.263
Well, countries like the UK tend to adopt a mentality of “out of sight, out of mind”.

00:14:59.073 --> 00:15:02.253
Recycling is sent abroad in vast containers.

00:15:02.623 --> 00:15:07.643
The rubbish to be recycled is weighed, and the country gives itself a

00:15:07.713 --> 00:15:12.093
pat on the back because it has “recycled” a certain amount of waste.

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:19.483
The problem is that a lot of this rubbish to be recycled is almost completely unusable.

00:15:20.243 --> 00:15:27.553
There was an excellent documentary from 2018 called Dirty Business that exposed exactly

00:15:27.563 --> 00:15:34.293
how this worked, and it contained shocking footage of huge piles of waste that had

00:15:34.293 --> 00:15:41.253
been set aside for recycling lying in places like Hong Kong, Malaysia and even Poland.

00:15:42.323 --> 00:15:49.763
So Frank, and perhaps even you and me, might think that we are doing our bit for the environment,

00:15:49.833 --> 00:15:57.213
but the reality is that in many cases the final destination for that yoghurt pot is not to be

00:15:57.213 --> 00:16:05.163
turned into a water bottle but to sit in a field in Malaysia or to bob around in the Pacific Ocean.

00:16:06.154 --> 00:16:12.514
So what is Frank to do, and is there any light at the end of this particular tunnel?

00:16:13.214 --> 00:16:16.534
Well, environmental groups would tell Frank to

00:16:16.704 --> 00:16:21.424
consume less, and to reuse and repair whenever he can.

00:16:22.494 --> 00:16:27.134
Frank can also take some comfort in the knowledge that, although yes

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:31.544
we might still put rubbish in landfills similar to the ancient Greeks,

00:16:31.814 --> 00:16:36.504
technology is improving and helping us get better at managing rubbish.

00:16:37.484 --> 00:16:43.344
In particular, when it comes to Frank’s favourite subject, recycling, technological

00:16:43.344 --> 00:16:49.894
improvements mean that it is easier than ever to separate waste, to separate Frank’s

00:16:49.894 --> 00:16:55.104
bottle tops from the glass or to separate the plastic from the cardboard, so that

00:16:55.124 --> 00:17:00.534
an increasing amount of whatever is put in the recycling bin actually gets recycled.

00:17:01.754 --> 00:17:07.154
So, to end on a slightly optimistic note, sure there has never been a point

00:17:07.174 --> 00:17:12.514
in human history where so much rubbish has been produced by so many people.

00:17:13.404 --> 00:17:17.774
To be precise, there’s over 2 billion tonnes of rubbish produced

00:17:17.794 --> 00:17:22.644
every year worldwide, and even in the countries that typically don't

00:17:22.684 --> 00:17:27.374
produce much rubbish now, rubbish production per capita is increasing.

00:17:29.024 --> 00:17:32.434
But never before in human history has there been a

00:17:32.454 --> 00:17:35.664
better system in place for actually dealing with it.

00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:42.394
Yes, it is far from perfect, and there are many many holes, flaws, and

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:47.874
misaligned incentives, but this is no reason to give up all hope, and

00:17:47.874 --> 00:17:53.204
certainly no reason for Frank to give up his beloved tinned baked beans.

00:17:54.804 --> 00:18:00.354
OK then, that is it for today's episode on where all of our rubbish goes.

00:18:00.654 --> 00:18:05.474
I hope it's been an interesting and thought-provoking one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:18:06.244 --> 00:18:09.484
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:18:09.824 --> 00:18:12.944
Do you know much about where rubbish is sent in your country?

00:18:13.354 --> 00:18:16.774
Is it a subject that you had ever spent much time thinking about,

00:18:16.944 --> 00:18:20.604
or is it someone else’s problem once it’s thrown in the bin?

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:26.014
How do you think people should be encouraged to consume less, or should

00:18:26.014 --> 00:18:29.834
we put more of a focus on dealing with our rubbish appropriately?

00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:32.854
Or is it a delicate balance between the two?

00:18:33.524 --> 00:18:34.724
I would love to know.

00:18:35.054 --> 00:18:37.884

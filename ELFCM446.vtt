Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:16.174
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:20.144
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:25.334
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:29.084
mini series, on the sensitive but important topic of slavery.

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:35.517
In part one, in this episode, we are going to talk about slavery in antiquity, in the ancient world.

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:40.764
Then in part two, we will look at the transatlantic slave trade, the period in

00:00:40.764 --> 00:00:46.634
history where over ten million Africans were rounded up, sold into slavery, and packed

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:51.264
off on boats to the Americas to labour under the most unimaginable of conditions.

00:00:51.954 --> 00:00:56.344
And in our final part, part three, we are going to talk about the unfortunate

00:00:56.354 --> 00:01:00.614
reality of modern slavery, of the slavery that still exists today.

00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:06.311
Ok then, we have got a lot to be getting on with, so let’s get right into it.

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:11.881
If you are a software developer, or you have a technical background,

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:17.031
you probably have experience working with masters and slaves.

00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:24.551
This refers to a model of communication and control between two parts of a computer system.

00:01:25.491 --> 00:01:29.861
The master controls, it issues commands, and the slave

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:33.471
awaits commands and does whatever the master asks it to.

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:40.771
This master-slave terminology has been in use for over 100 years, with

00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:45.031
few people batting an eyelid, thinking that it was in any way problematic.

00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:53.311
It made sense; masters and slaves, those with power and those without, putting

00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:57.751
aside the ethics for a minute, these are familiar concepts to all of us.

00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:04.001
In fact, this master-slave terminology has only recently come under greater

00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:08.991
scrutiny, with some prominent software companies pushing to change the language.

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:16.881
Of course, language matters, and using the terms “master” and “slave” reminds us

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:22.411
of one of the oldest, cruellest, and most inhumane practices in human history:

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:28.501
the practice of reducing another human being to property, removing their freedoms

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:34.121
and forcing that person to work for free for the personal gain of someone else.

00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:39.781
Now, perhaps you might think it surprising that it took so long for these terms

00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:45.231
to be considered inappropriate, but it reminds us of the sad reality that the

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:50.161
practice of slavery has been in existence for practically all of humanity,

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:54.944
there have been masters and slaves for much longer than there have not been.

00:02:56.411 --> 00:03:01.101
And evidence of slavery goes back as far as the first civilisations.

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:09.881
Mesopotamia, back in 3500 BC, Ancient Egypt, Ancient India and Ancient China, there is evidence

00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:16.003
of slavery in all of these civilisations, strongly suggesting that so long as mankind has

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:21.876
lived together in “civilisation”, we have engaged in this most uncivilised of behaviour.

00:03:22.553 --> 00:03:25.443
And this is the kind of slavery that we are going to

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:29.083
focus on in this episode, slavery in the ancient world.

00:03:30.063 --> 00:03:35.913
Now, the most dedicated listeners among you may remember an episode about slavery from our

00:03:35.913 --> 00:03:40.773
mini-series on Ancient Rome, where we talked about slaves in Ancient Rome specifically.

00:03:41.343 --> 00:03:48.953
That was episode 318, and we even made another member-only episode on Spartacus, which

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:55.493
was episode number 193, so if you haven’t listened to those and there isn’t enough slavery

00:03:55.503 --> 00:03:59.663
in this mini-series for your liking, then you can go back and listen to those ones too.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:05.813
Anyway, the reason I’m mentioning this is to explain why this mini-series will

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:11.153
be slightly lighter on Ancient Roman slaves, and we’ll be focusing elsewhere.

00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:18.463
Now, you may know the phrase, the old adage, “history is written by the victors”.

00:04:19.513 --> 00:04:24.213
It means that historical records are normally told through the eyes and

00:04:24.373 --> 00:04:29.533
from the perspective of the powerful, those who win wars and conflicts.

00:04:30.693 --> 00:04:36.049
This most certainly holds true when talking about slaves and slavery, especially

00:04:36.049 --> 00:04:41.299
in the ancient world, as there are virtually no accounts of what slavery was like

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.009
from the perspective of the slave, no matter what civilisation we are talking about.

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:48.779
So, we must look elsewhere.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.499
From accounts in stories and texts we can hypothesise about what life as a slave

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.909
might have been like, but one of the best early sources that gives us some idea

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.549
about the lives of slaves, and how slaves fitted into a particular society,

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.169
come from legal codes, from how slaves were treated in the eyes of the law.

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:17.929
Going right back to the first legal code in known history, something called

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:22.839
the Code of Ur-Nammu, there is evidence of how slaves fitted into society.

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:29.359
This code comes from Ancient Mesopotamia, in modern day Iraq, and

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:37.443
archaeologists believe it dates  from around 2100 BC, so over 4,000 years ago.

00:05:38.983 --> 00:05:43.733
This code has various references for the punishments for different sorts

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:49.083
of crimes, both against normal members of society and against slaves.

00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:56.813
There are specific laws for what happens when slaves marry other slaves, when slaves marry

00:05:56.823 --> 00:06:02.883
non-slaves, and even what happens to a man who is found guilty of raping a virgin slave.

00:06:04.023 --> 00:06:10.293
Moving forward a few years, a Babylonian legal text from the 18th century BC goes into

00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:16.036
even greater detail about the treatment of slaves, including what happened to slaves

00:06:16.036 --> 00:06:21.436
that tried to escape, what happened if a man harmed the slave of another man, and so on.

00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:29.126
The fascinating but disturbing thing about these ancient legal codes is that, despite

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:34.826
the fact that slaves were afforded some legal protections, it is abundantly clear that

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:41.316
slaves were considered property with a monetary value rather than as human beings, they

00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:47.426
were legally treated as possessions to protect rather than humans with rights to uphold.

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:54.006
And this is the case for practically every civilisation for which there are surviving

00:06:54.006 --> 00:07:00.236
legal codes that reference slavery: slaves were the property of another man, and they

00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:05.856
should be treated as such, more similar to a house or cow than another human being.

00:07:07.466 --> 00:07:15.416
Now, as to the question of how one became a slave in Babylon or Mesopotamia, or even Ancient

00:07:15.436 --> 00:07:21.476
Greece, Rome or Egypt, there were broadly five different categories of of how someone had

00:07:21.476 --> 00:07:28.806
the misfortune to wind up as the slave of someone else, and these categories perhaps help us

00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:34.501
understand how it was possible for human beings to treat their fellow humans with such inhumanity.

00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:41.091
The first, and almost certainly the largest, was by being captured in war.

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:48.441
A victorious army might round up men, women and children, and bring them back as slaves.

00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:53.601
The second category is the poor children who were born into slavery.

00:07:54.571 --> 00:08:01.941
The destiny for the children of two slave parents was, in most cases, to become a slave, so this

00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:08.241
category of slave may never have known freedom, having been born into slavery and dying a slave.

00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:14.041
The third category is of people who were forced into slavery because of debt.

00:08:15.091 --> 00:08:20.261
They would either have to sell themselves into slavery to pay off their debts, or they would

00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:27.181
be sold by their creditors, so this category of slave was a curious one, having previously

00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:33.141
been a free, normal member of society, and being pushed into slavery because of debt.

00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:39.701
The fourth and penultimate category is semi-related, and that’s

00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:43.151
people who were forced into slavery as a criminal punishment.

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:49.051
This happened in Ancient Rome and Greece, and is referenced in the legal codes of

00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.771
Ancient Mesopotamia, and there are multiple references to it in the Bible as well.

00:08:55.231 --> 00:09:01.041
And the final category is of people who were kidnapped or sold by slave traders, people

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:05.511
who would raid towns or villages and capture anyone who could be sold into slavery.

00:09:06.911 --> 00:09:14.251
Now, I’m sure it is difficult for anyone today to imagine how human beings, and entire societies,

00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:21.329
could have tolerated and embraced slavery for so long, but perhaps the fact that most of the slaves

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:28.027
were seen as either being from an enemy state or unknown country, or having commited some crime and

00:09:28.217 --> 00:09:34.177
needing to pay for it, perhaps this helped people rationalise this behaviour to a certain degree.

00:09:35.627 --> 00:09:42.167
And to state the obvious, we’ve been generalising here; while slavery was mostly tolerated and

00:09:42.377 --> 00:09:47.757
enshrined in legal codes, there were clearly some people who opposed it and thought it was wrong.

00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:54.087
Cyrus The Great, the 6th century Persian king, is often remembered as having

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:59.447
great sympathy for slaves, and is credited with freeing Jewish slaves in Babylon.

00:10:00.297 --> 00:10:07.129
But slavery still existed under Cyrus, he may have shown some compassion towards a particular group

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:12.633
of people who were enslaved, but there is no evidence that he thought slavery to be morally wrong.

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:19.724
Even the great Greek philosophers managed to make slavery fit into their worldview.

00:10:20.704 --> 00:10:26.134
Plato and Aristotle, two of the most well-known and respected philosophers in human

00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:31.884
history, they both managed to reconcile slavery with a healthy and functioning civilisation.

00:10:33.714 --> 00:10:39.394
In Plato’s case, he saw slavery as part of the natural order of the world.

00:10:40.044 --> 00:10:44.474
Slavery should exist, Plato wrote, and for it not to

00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:47.734
exist would be contrary to the natural order of the world.

00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:55.674
The only concession he did make was that some people shouldn’t be enslaved, but those people were,

00:10:56.094 --> 00:11:02.904
surprise surprise, The Greeks, who he saw as “naturally free”, as they were superior to non-Greeks.

00:11:03.994 --> 00:11:08.754
Plato’s student, Aristotle, was even more vocal in his support of slavery.

00:11:09.564 --> 00:11:16.464
In his work "Politics," he introduces the concept of the "natural slave" - someone who is

00:11:16.474 --> 00:11:22.084
naturally suited to be ruled over and lacks the rational capacity to govern themselves.

00:11:22.984 --> 00:11:27.474
He believed that some people were slaves by nature and

00:11:27.604 --> 00:11:30.484
it was beneficial for them to be ruled by a master.

00:11:32.004 --> 00:11:36.514
Of course, we will see this idea of some people being inferior, and thus

00:11:36.554 --> 00:11:41.444
destined for slavery, in the transatlantic slave trade, but then it's

00:11:41.464 --> 00:11:45.644
based more on the colour of one’s skin rather than where they come from.

00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:51.105
Now, Plato and Aristotle, these are two of the most well-known and

00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:56.355
best-regarded philosophers in history, and there you have them finding a

00:11:56.355 --> 00:12:01.935
way to rationalise a practice that we today find despicable and inhumane.

00:12:03.476 --> 00:12:07.535
Perhaps you could argue that the fact that they felt that they needed to address the issue of

00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:13.665
slavery showed some kind of subconscious understanding of the fact that it was morally problematic,

00:12:14.295 --> 00:12:19.425
but both of these world-famous philosophers were able to look at the reality that their society

00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:26.055
was split between the free and the enslaved and say, “yes, that makes perfect sense to us”.

00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:31.165
Now, as to “day to day” lives of slaves, and what

00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:34.587
tasks they were given, clearly it was highly variable.

00:12:35.177 --> 00:12:40.817
But as a general rule of thumb, slaves in antiquity, whether that be in Ancient

00:12:40.847 --> 00:12:45.759
Egypt, Ancient Greece, Rome or Mesopotamia, they were charged with doing all

00:12:45.759 --> 00:12:50.469
the manual and often back-breaking labour that their masters did not want to do.

00:12:51.219 --> 00:12:57.209
From farming to household labour, construction to working on ships, slaves powered much

00:12:57.209 --> 00:13:01.669
of the economies of these ancient civilisations which we now revere, which we look up to.

00:13:03.177 --> 00:13:06.847
But, contrary to what many people believe, slaves in the

00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:10.207
ancient world were not always limited to manual labour.

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:16.927
Given that being taken as a prisoner of war was a major way in which people became slaves,

00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:23.937
teachers, accountants and other skilled professionals could find themselves enslaved, and there is

00:13:24.007 --> 00:13:29.477
plenty of evidence of their new masters making the best possible use of their new slaves’ skills.

00:13:30.987 --> 00:13:34.917
And as you might expect, when slaves were bought and sold, the

00:13:34.917 --> 00:13:38.137
price was determined by the perceived value of their labour.

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:43.667
If someone was old and sick and would be good for some basic manual tasks, they

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:48.007
would command a much lower price than a young and healthy slave, who might be put to

00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:53.077
work in the fields if he was a man, or sent into the household if she was a woman.

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:59.607
And on this note, the role of female slaves was often a dual

00:13:59.607 --> 00:14:03.407
one, being forced to act as sexual slaves for their masters.

00:14:04.257 --> 00:14:08.757
Or perhaps even worse, given that slaves were the legal property of their

00:14:08.757 --> 00:14:13.577
masters, a particularly cruel master could force a female slave into

00:14:13.577 --> 00:14:17.317
prostitution, and would collect the money that she made as a prostitute.

00:14:18.327 --> 00:14:22.067
As prostitution was legal in Ancient Rome, there is

00:14:22.117 --> 00:14:25.597
evidence of this being the fate for some poor female slaves.

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:33.552
Now, what is abundantly clear is how ingrained slaves were in many ancient societies.

00:14:34.292 --> 00:14:40.202
These economies were based heavily on slavery - the relatively luxurious lives that one might

00:14:40.202 --> 00:14:45.732
imagine of the Ancient Greeks or Romans or Egyptians, or we could even expand this to Ancient

00:14:45.762 --> 00:14:52.262
China, these were made possible by the unpaid and enforced labour of the slave underclass.

00:14:53.822 --> 00:14:58.612
It was how the world worked, nobody had known anything different, and even

00:14:58.612 --> 00:15:03.172
the most well-known philosophers and kings of the ancient world found ways

00:15:03.172 --> 00:15:08.312
to rationalise it and profess that it was the “natural” order of the world.

00:15:09.752 --> 00:15:14.372
In fact, not owning slaves would put you at a large disadvantage.

00:15:15.502 --> 00:15:20.782
Having many slaves was often a sign of your high social status, and it also

00:15:20.822 --> 00:15:24.398
meant that you had a fleet of people who would do your bidding for free.

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:31.452
It is, of course, hard to find a perfect modern comparison, but if we think of

00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:36.792
something that is as instrumental to the smooth running of the modern world as slavery

00:15:36.792 --> 00:15:42.092
was to the ancient world, perhaps we could take the extreme example of electricity.

00:15:43.162 --> 00:15:48.992
If, in 2024, you state that you have a moral objection to electricity, and

00:15:49.172 --> 00:15:52.882
you decide to not use anything electric because you are concerned about

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:57.512
global warming, let’s say, or some other moral problem with using electricity.

00:15:58.462 --> 00:16:04.972
Clearly, this puts you at a large disadvantage to the rest of society, as electricity

00:16:04.972 --> 00:16:10.352
makes everything easier: it powers our telephones, it heats our water, it cooks our food.

00:16:11.382 --> 00:16:15.164
People used electricity before you were born, people have been

00:16:15.164 --> 00:16:18.402
using it all your life, of course you’re going to use it too.

00:16:19.552 --> 00:16:26.256
Now, this is obviously an imperfect comparison - electricity has approximately 0%

00:16:26.433 --> 00:16:32.332
of the same moral problems as slavery - but perhaps it gets us one step closer to

00:16:32.332 --> 00:16:36.592
understanding why there is so little evidence of people in the ancient world taking

00:16:36.592 --> 00:16:43.662
issue with slavery, and also helps remind us how pivotal this cruel behaviour was for

00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:49.022
the successful-functioning of economies from Rome to Alexandria, Babylon to Athens.

00:16:50.402 --> 00:16:56.830
So, to wrap things up, slavery powered the ancient world, and it would only really be with

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:03.170
the fall of Rome in the 5th century that this cruel practice started to evolve, at least.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.370
Die out it would not, but for a thousand years or so, at least in

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:13.070
Europe, its nature changed, and the worst of the barbarity was over.

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:19.390
Then, like a phoenix from the ashes, in the 16th century slavery would

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:24.420
return in an industrialised and factory-like manner, go on for hundreds

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.520
of years, and leave a mark that still defines much of the world today.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.840
That is the translatlantic Slave Trade, and that is

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.600
what we’ll cover in part two of this mini-series.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:42.590
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Slavery in the Ancient World.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.270
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that it has

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.870
laid some groundwork for what is to come in parts two and parts three of this mini-series.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.080
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.420
Why do you think so many people were able to justify this for so long?

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.160
Are there any similar behaviours in the modern world that

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.740
you think historians will look back on in a similar way?

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.640
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.570

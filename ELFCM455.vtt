Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.749
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.669
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.209 --> 00:00:24.889
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Legend of King Arthur.

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.079
From Ireland to Wales, England to Brittany, King Arthur appears as a

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.659
mysterious figure, a legendary king ruling over a utopian, ideal kingdom

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.009
and prophesised to come back to life when the world needs him most.

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:42.649
But who really was King Arthur?

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.159
Where did he come from?

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:47.629
Was he a real king, or just a fictional creation?

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.009
Well, let’s not waste a minute, and find out.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.889
In 1999, the American author Robert McKee published his seminal work,

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:04.729
Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting.

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:11.957
It is something of a bible for aspiring writers, both on screen and in literature.

00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:16.701
In it, he lists what he believes are the attributes of a

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:21.831
successful story, a tale that has the potential to hook us in.

00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:28.671
These include well-developed characters with clear desires, motivations, and flaws.

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:34.641
It includes tension and conflict, of course, both external and internal.

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:40.021
It includes what he calls the three-act paradigm, where a

00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:44.151
story is set up, there is a confrontation and a resolution.

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:47.261
There is the incident that starts the whole thing

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.371
off, as well as the importance of cause and effect.

00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:55.791
There’s the importance of exploring deeper themes around human existence, and of

00:01:55.791 --> 00:02:02.151
course, the importance for a character to undergo a transformation as the story unfolds.

00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:08.811
McKee was writing this in the late 20th century, but if you read

00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:13.351
the story of King Arthur, the legendary English king, it's almost

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:18.301
as if someone had crafted it following McKee’s blueprint to the tee.

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:23.661
There’s the personal growth, the tension and conflict, the theme of

00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:29.011
morality and ethics, and of course, there is the three-arced hero’s journey.

00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:34.541
Now, the legend of King Arthur dates back to the 5th or 6th century,

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:39.471
and it has changed a lot over the years, with new characters being

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:43.251
introduced and the plot going in all sorts of different directions.

00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:48.693
So even if you know a story of King Arthur already, it might

00:02:48.713 --> 00:02:52.043
very well be a different story to the one I’m about to tell you.

00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:58.933
And if you have never heard of the legend of King Arthur, or you have but you can’t really

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:04.023
remember it, well let me change that now with the most popular version of the legend.

00:03:05.463 --> 00:03:11.303
The story begins with the young Arthur, who is not a king at this point, but a mere squire, a

00:03:11.303 --> 00:03:17.573
young man who acts as a sort of servant to real knights before perhaps becoming a knight himself.

00:03:18.713 --> 00:03:23.093
Arthur comes across a sword that is stuck in a stone.

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:29.873
It is said that only the true king of England will be able to remove the sword from the stone.

00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:37.083
Plenty of ambitious, strong knights have tried, but none have managed to remove the sword.

00:03:37.843 --> 00:03:41.383
Then, Arthur, still a young boy, gives it a go.

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:49.803
To everyone’s surprise, he manages, proving that he is the true king of England.

00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:56.983
He is crowned king, and he establishes his kingdom, the mythical kingdom of Camelot.

00:03:58.523 --> 00:04:01.743
Under Arthur's rule, Camelot thrives.

00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:07.533
His court is based on chivalry, honour, and justice, all very important

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:12.343
qualities in the medieval era, where his tale would become particularly popular.

00:04:13.773 --> 00:04:19.423
You might remember one of the key elements of Camelot, and that was the round table.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:25.183
The Round Table is a powerful symbol of Arthur’s ideals as king.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:32.843
In medieval times, someone’s place at a table, especially in court, said a lot about their status.

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:38.403
The most important person, in this case the king, would sit at the head of

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:43.913
the table, and the closer someone sat to him, the more important they were.

00:04:45.313 --> 00:04:52.033
Arthur wanted all of his knights to be equal, so they sat at a round table, with no ‘head’.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.220
Wherever a knight was sitting, he knew he would be treated

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.990
as an equal to the other knights, and even to the king.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.130
And initially, life at Camelot was plain sailing, everything went smoothly.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:15.060
Arthur’s main companions, his sidekicks, if you will, included Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain and Sir

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.420
Percival, as well as a bunch of other chivalrous knights who embarked on quests to uphold justice,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.900
protect the weak, and seek the elusive Holy Grail, a sacred relic associated with Jesus Christ.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.960
But, just like in any good story, things start to go wrong.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.570
Specifically, his best friend and most loyal knight, Sir Lancelot,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.530
turns out to be having a love affair with Arthur’s wife, Guinevere.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.060
What’s more, while Arthur is away, a man called Mordred causes trouble back at Camelot.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.840
Now, differing versions of the story describe Mordred in different ways.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:05.420
Some describe him as Arthur’s nephew, others as Arthur’s illegitimate son with his half-sister.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.990
In all versions, he is a nasty piece of work, a serious baddie.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.180
He leads an uprising against King Arthur, which culminates in an epic battle,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:23.490
the Battle of Camlann, where there is a huge showdown between Arthur and Mordred.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.499
The two men fight each other in the battle, with Mordred mortally wounding

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:33.870
Arthur, and in some versions, Arthur mortally wounds Mordred in return.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.430
When the king realises that he is about to die, he entrusts his trusty sword,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.820
Excalibur, to one of his knights and instructs him to return the sword to

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.560
the Lady of the Lake, who is a sort of fairy-like figure who lives in a lake.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.260
Thereafter, King Arthur is transported to a mythical island called

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.950
Avalon, where some versions suggest he may be healed of his wounds.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.330
And the legend closes with the promise of Arthur's eventual

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.730
return, leaving his kingdom and his loyal knights behind.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:15.980
Now, this is a brief overview of the general story, and as you’ll have realised, there

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.830
are multiple different versions which all take the story in a different direction.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.290
It is a wonderful story, and, at least according to most historians,

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.820
the reason that it is such a wonderful story is precisely because that’s

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:37.250
all it is; it is fictional, with only a very minor basis in history.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.590
The Arthurian legend we know today really got started in the

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.920
1100s with the writings of a man called Geoffrey of Monmouth.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.980
Geoffrey set out to write a full history of the Kings

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.430
of Britain, the so-called Historia Regum Britanniae.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:01.830
Now, if you are a British history buff, you may know that lists of “modern”

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.750
British kings and queens often start in 1066, with William the Conqueror.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.790
But, clearly, there were kings and queens before that.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.150
And this was what Geoffrey of Monmouth set out to document.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.370
A king Arthur had appeared in a couple of historical texts from the

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.800
9th and 10th centuries, and Geoffrey of Monmouth sought to gather

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.400
as much information as he could, to try to patch together his story.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.344
This story attracted a lot of what we might now call fanfiction, or retellings,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.820
including one a few decades later by a French writer called Chretien de Troyes.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:51.850
Now, Geoffrey of Monmouth was a cleric, a clergyman, so his tale was somewhat matter-of-fact,

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:57.290
it told the story without major flair or exaggeration, or indeed storytelling.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.740
It was intended to be a historical document after all.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.360
Chretien de Troyes, on the other hand, was a medieval poet, so

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:11.130
he focused more on the story, the characters, and the romance.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:19.740
He explored ideas of courtly love, chivalry and knighthood, and added these dimensions to his story.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:26.380
It’s also thought that the Lancelot-Guinevere-Arthur love triangle was his addition,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.240
so we certainly have this French poet to thank for adding the romantic twist.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.700
But that’s not it.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.720
As the centuries rolled by, the tale was adopted and adapted by a bunch of different writers.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.730
In the 13th century, Christian authors added some more Christian morality to the story, including

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:54.310
introducing consequences for the affair between Lancelot and Guinevere, and turning the previously

00:09:54.510 --> 00:10:00.740
non-religious Grail into the Holy Grail, the cup Jesus drank from during the Last Supper.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.170
And in the 15th century, an English author called Thomas Mallory put this

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:12.690
all together in a 300,000-word epic that he called Le Morte d'Arthur.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:16.850
The title was in French–it means “The Death of Arthur”

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.100
in English–but the book was written in English.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.020
He chose the French title because many of his sources for the

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.830
book, including the work by Chretien de Troyes, were in French.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.910
Now, I’m not sure what Robert McKee would say about giving away what happens to your protagonist

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.995
in the title of your book, but this is now the best-known version of the legend of King

00:10:39.995 --> 00:10:45.620
Arthur, and the story I told you at the start broadly follows the story in Le Morte d'Arthur.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:53.120
But there is more to Le Morte d’Arthur than the Arthurian tale, it goes into detail

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:58.370
about the stories of Arthur’s knights, and it is truly an epic piece of work.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:05.240
I mean, it’s 300,000 words long, and was published as a collection of 8 different books.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:11.130
So, if you are feeling particularly energetic and you want to pick up a book

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:16.350
as ‘the’ Legend of King Arthur, then this is probably the one to start with.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.840
Now, as to the legacy of King Arthur in Britain, it is fairly monumental.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.550
Arthur is almost always in the top 10 most popular boys' names,

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.771
although the names of other characters in the story, such as

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:35.960
Guinevere, Lancelot and Mordred haven’t caught on to the same degree.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:41.240
You can visit the supposed Round Table in the town of Winchester, you can go to

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:46.830
Glastonbury Abbey, which is supposedly the burial place of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.660
You can go to a castle in Cornwall which is also supposedly the burial place of

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:57.120
King Arthur, you can even go to a small lake in Devon, next to Cornwall, which is

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.120
supposedly where the Lady Of The Lake took back Excalibur, Arthur’s great sword.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:09.890
And of course, there are lots of reinterpretations of the Arthurian legend for all ages.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:15.900
You might remember the wonderful Disney film Sword in the Stone, which has a boy called

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:21.610
Arthur as its main character, a sword stuck in a stone of course, and a wizard named Merlin.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.170
It was based on a book of the same name, but the book is a

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.960
20th-century children’s reinterpretation of the famous legend.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.790
Then there’s the kind of cheesy Hollywood telling of the story, the

00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:39.970
1995 movie First Night, which starred Sean Connery, Julia Ormond and

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.250
Richard Gere in the love triangle between Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:50.240
Or for a more gritty attempt at historical accuracy, or at least a less fluffy

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:56.490
version, you can try the 2004 film King Arthur, with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.580
And, lest I forget, there is also one that makes only a very fleeting attempt at

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:08.160
historical accuracy but is very funny, and that’s Monty Python And The Holy Grail.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.000
So, to wrap things up, the legend of King Arthur is one

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:16.070
of the most powerful and popular myths in English history.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:22.190
In all probability, there was no real King Arthur, and if there was, the

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:27.740
probability that he had a round table, and an almost soap opera-like love triangle

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:32.920
between his knight Lancelot and his wife Guinevere, well it seems very unlikely.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.080
But as long as you aren’t coming to the story of King Arthur

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.600
and looking for historical accuracy, does it really matter?

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.140
And who cares?

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.790
I’d say that it makes it all the more interesting, the mystery around it has meant

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:53.380
that dozens of people have taken the story and added to it over the years, with

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:59.460
the result that the modern interpretation isn’t just one story, but the work of

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.000
dozens, hundreds even, of people guiding the characters in the direction they wanted.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:10.700
And, as you’ve heard, the result is a simply legendary story.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.630
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Legend of King Arthur.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.010
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.660
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.160
Have you heard of the story of King Arthur before?

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.860
Which version have you heard?

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:35.090
And are there stories like this from your country that have evolved and developed in the same way?

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:38.640
I would love to know, so let’s get the discussion started.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.680

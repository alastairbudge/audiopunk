Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.480
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.720
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:25.680
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.390
mini-series, this time on fertility in the 21st century.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.019
In part one, in this episode, we are going to set the scene by talking about

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.550
population trends, specifically, downward trends, and why this matters.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.510
In part two we are going to do a deep dive into in vitro fertilisation, otherwise known as IVF,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.220
and look at how this has medical procedure has revolutionised the lives of couples all over the

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.809
world, and literally allowed millions of babies to be born who might otherwise not have been.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.979
And in part three, our final part, we are going to talk about the future of fertility, and look at

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.590
some of the potential developments that lie in store for how babies might be born in the future.

00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:22.203
OK then, let’s get right into it, and talk about the world’s shrinking population.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:33.493
On August 26th of 2022, Elon Musk, a father of 11, tweeted “Population collapse

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:39.243
due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming”.

00:01:40.763 --> 00:01:47.243
The tweet wasn’t explicitly about global warming, which Musk added he believed was a major risk.

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:52.423
But it paled in comparison with population collapse.

00:01:53.423 --> 00:01:58.723
Now, you may remember a member-only episode we made back in 2021 about how

00:01:58.723 --> 00:02:05.213
beliefs about global population growth have changed over time, but in this episode

00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:10.683
we are going to focus specifically on the issue of global population decline.

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:15.223
So, what is going on with the global population?

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:20.733
What is happening to global birth rates, is it going to lead to global

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:26.413
population collapse, what can be done to stop this, and what happens if we don’t?

00:02:27.703 --> 00:02:34.233
As a quick reminder, the late 18th century British scholar Robert Malthus had proposed that the

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:41.693
world faced exactly the opposite risk: the global population was increasing too quickly, and

00:02:41.973 --> 00:02:49.343
there would be mass famines, wars and death as humans competed for a limited supply of food.

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:55.763
Fortunately, that didn’t happen, but it didn’t stop the scaremongering.

00:02:57.153 --> 00:03:03.533
A century and a half later, in the 1960s and 1970s, there were stories and

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:09.123
reports about the world running out of space, there not being enough food to

00:03:09.123 --> 00:03:15.483
feed everyone, and how humanity was set to reproduce itself into extinction.

00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:21.423
To quote the opening sentence of the 1968 book The Population

00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:25.863
Bomb, “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.”

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:32.794
The world was teetering on the edge, and it was only a matter of time before the

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:38.534
population grew so much that there would be mass famine, civil unrest and catastrophe.

00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:45.904
Now, that didn’t happen either, and the global population has gone from 3.5

00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:51.714
billion when that ominous statement was published to just over 8 billion today.

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:58.554
And in fact, today’s demographers and economists are focussing on

00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:04.154
a very different problem: a decline in global population, or as a

00:04:04.184 --> 00:04:08.814
paper from the Hoover Institution put it, The De-Population Bomb.

00:04:10.124 --> 00:04:13.174
So, let’s start with some statistics.

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:18.614
In all of recorded human history, the human population has never

00:04:18.684 --> 00:04:24.294
experienced a year on year decline, the global population has always grown.

00:04:25.314 --> 00:04:30.794
And yes, this is even the case during wars, plagues and famines, which

00:04:30.894 --> 00:04:37.134
might kill tens of millions, but on aggregate, on a global level, in every

00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:42.184
year in recorded history, there have always been more people born than die.

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:51.384
But, sometime close to the year 2100, according to demographers, this is going to change.

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:57.174
The year will end with fewer people in the world than it started with.

00:04:58.974 --> 00:05:05.194
Probably not that many fewer, around 10 million fewer people, but this number

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:10.204
will continue to increase as the global population continues to decline.

00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:13.164
So, what’s happening?

00:05:14.424 --> 00:05:17.514
On one level, the explanation is very simple.

00:05:18.474 --> 00:05:22.304
People, women specifically, are having fewer children.

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:30.284
And, at the risk of sounding blindingly obvious,  if there are more births than deaths, the

00:05:30.284 --> 00:05:35.861
population grows, and if there are fewer births than deaths, the population   decreases.

00:05:37.154 --> 00:05:42.304
Now, there are some nuances to this on a national level, like it doesn’t

00:05:42.314 --> 00:05:47.574
include immigration or emigration, and assumes that life expectancy stays

00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:53.464
the same, but over the long term on a global level, this holds true.

00:05:54.944 --> 00:05:58.964
There is actually a technical term for the amount of children

00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:03.144
that a woman needs to have for the population to remain stable.

00:06:04.344 --> 00:06:06.413
It’s called the “replacement rate”.

00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:14.194
It's typically around 2.1, but can be slightly higher in areas with higher mortality rates.

00:06:15.384 --> 00:06:22.244
In other words, for the population to remain the same, a woman needs to have an average of

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:30.744
2.1 children; one to replace her, one to replace the father, and 0.1 left over just in case.

00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:37.160
Globally, the fertility rate is still above this replacement rate;

00:06:37.394 --> 00:06:45.613
it was 2.3 in 2021, but this is down from a high of 5.3 in 1963.

00:06:47.221 --> 00:06:53.714
And as you will know, there is a huge variation in fertility rates by country.

00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:59.234
In the West African country of Niger, the average woman

00:06:59.464 --> 00:07:07.094
has 6.8 children, but in South Korea that number is 0.8.

00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:15.954
Even in the world’s most populous country until recently, China, the fertility rate is at 1.1.

00:07:17.044 --> 00:07:24.234
In Europe it is an average of 1.53 and the US isn’t much higher, at 1.78.

00:07:25.584 --> 00:07:32.874
And if you plot a graph of fertility rate against level of economic development, there is a very

00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:40.604
clear sign: the more a country develops economically, the fewer babies are born to every woman.

00:07:42.234 --> 00:07:46.604
This is a very clear trend, albeit with a few anomalies.

00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:52.574
For example, Israel which is a developed country but still maintains a high

00:07:52.584 --> 00:07:58.174
fertility rate, or countries like Jamaica, Bosnia and Herzegovina or Ukraine,

00:07:58.434 --> 00:08:03.364
which are less economically developed countries but still have low fertility rates.

00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:09.644
Now, we’ll get to some of the theories as to why this is in a minute, but let’s

00:08:09.644 --> 00:08:16.134
talk about the overall trend first: globally, fertility rates are decreasing.

00:08:17.284 --> 00:08:23.034
Even in countries with high fertility rates, they are decreasing - Yemen had

00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:30.474
a whopping 8.9 births per woman in 1986, and is now down to a casual 3.8.

00:08:31.964 --> 00:08:38.094
Assuming all countries develop over time and follow a similar pattern to developed countries

00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:44.217
almost every country will end up with a fertility rate lower than the replacement rate.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:50.694
And the result of this is that some time in the latter half of the

00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:55.754
twenty-first century the global fertility rate will fall below the

00:08:55.754 --> 00:09:00.554
replacement rate, which will mean that population decline is inevitable.

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:05.114
In some countries, it’s happening already.

00:09:06.464 --> 00:09:10.714
Japan’s population has been declining for 14 years in a row,

00:09:11.304 --> 00:09:15.324
South Korea’s population is set to start declining very soon.

00:09:16.804 --> 00:09:22.674
Italy’s population is now in decline, despite its relatively high levels of immigration.

00:09:23.744 --> 00:09:29.404
In the UK, where I am from, certain regions of the country would already be

00:09:29.414 --> 00:09:34.251
in decline were it not for immigration, for people arriving in the country.

00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:36.242
Namely Scotland and Wales.

00:09:37.097 --> 00:09:42.707
Were it not for immigrants moving to those areas, they would both be in population decline.

00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:48.185
So, why is this happening, and what does it mean?

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:55.005
Well, economists and demographers point at several often interlinked factors

00:09:55.275 --> 00:09:59.825
that they believe play a part in why people are choosing to have fewer babies.

00:10:00.755 --> 00:10:05.245
You will no doubt be aware of these already, but it’s worth spelling them out.

00:10:06.475 --> 00:10:11.235
The first is the general theme of increasing equality between sexes.

00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:17.205
As societies develop, most at least realise that women should be

00:10:17.205 --> 00:10:21.705
treated as the equals of men, not as mere baby-making machines.

00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:26.885
That means higher levels of education and independence for women,

00:10:27.255 --> 00:10:31.735
it means that women participate in the workforce, and are allowed to

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:36.015
have hopes and dreams of their own that go beyond producing children.

00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:42.935
While in many countries even 50 years ago, women might not have had the option

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:48.095
to do anything other than get married and have children, fortunately women

00:10:48.095 --> 00:10:53.395
today have the autonomy to choose to forge their own path, have a career

00:10:53.765 --> 00:10:58.785
and their own independence before deciding if they want to start a family.

00:11:00.295 --> 00:11:04.115
And as a result, especially in developed countries,

00:11:04.475 --> 00:11:08.285
women are choosing to have children later and later.

00:11:09.595 --> 00:11:18.435
In the UK, in 1975 the average age of a mother at birth was 26, and it’s now 31.

00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:24.675
The reason this matters in terms of a shrinking population is, as you

00:11:24.675 --> 00:11:28.495
will know and as we’ll come on to talk about more in part two, the

00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:32.635
longer a woman waits to try to have a child, the harder it can be.

00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:36.529
Then there is the cost of having children.

00:11:37.449 --> 00:11:42.409
Whether it is the cost of childcare, the opportunity cost of one parent taking

00:11:42.419 --> 00:11:47.239
time away from their career to look after a child, or the simple fact that you

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:53.039
have to look after another human being and provide for them, kids are expensive.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:59.259
I have two, which you might correctly point out also puts me below the

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:05.599
replacement level of 2.1, and I know firsthand quite how expensive kids can be.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:13.039
There is also the harder-to-quantify factor of a declining sense of optimism among young people.

00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:21.699
In the paper I mentioned earlier, The De-Population Bomb, the author cited this sense that, in the

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:29.249
US at least, during his research he found a general sense of doom and gloom among young people, a

00:12:29.289 --> 00:12:34.699
sense that they didn’t want to bring a child into a world that they were not enthusiastic about.

00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:42.999
Whether that's because of the higher cost of living, a society with more tensions, or fears about

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:50.979
global warming, his conclusion was that unlike at any time in postwar American history, young people

00:12:51.129 --> 00:12:57.739
are starting to feel pessimistic about the future, and therefore less willing to have children.

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:03.699
Another interesting element that he mentioned was, and again this is

00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:07.019
with respect to the United States, but I think it applies elsewhere

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:12.409
too, an increasing focus on convenience and personal autonomy.

00:13:13.999 --> 00:13:19.219
We are used to a lot of our lives being easy, whether that’s being able to watch any

00:13:19.239 --> 00:13:25.899
TV programme whenever we want, or order food delivery at the tap of an button, or chat

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:31.829
to anyone anywhere in the world, life has never been more convenient than it is today.

00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:40.469
And kids, well they are wonderful in so many ways, but they are a major inconvenience.

00:13:41.301 --> 00:13:48.222
I love my kids to bits, and my life is infinitely better with them in it, but boy are

00:13:48.222 --> 00:13:53.732
they inconvenient: they wake me up in the middle of the night, they dribble on me, I

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:57.902
don’t have time to shower in the morning, they get ill and I look after them when they

00:13:57.912 --> 00:14:03.552
can’t go to school, they need to be dressed, washed and fed every day, they shout and cry.

00:14:04.462 --> 00:14:09.772
Again, I wouldn’t change this for the world, but purely on a convenience and

00:14:09.812 --> 00:14:15.982
lack of stress level, as I’m sure any parent would agree, kids are inconvenient.

00:14:17.242 --> 00:14:21.822
And for a generation that has grown up with everything being convenient,

00:14:22.342 --> 00:14:26.942
having the autonomy to decide exactly what you do and when you do it, it is

00:14:27.012 --> 00:14:32.092
understandable why giving all of that up, despite the unknown potential future

00:14:32.092 --> 00:14:38.282
joys it might bring, well I can see why some people might decide not to have kids.

00:14:39.162 --> 00:14:43.082
And these factors have all combined to create a society

00:14:43.082 --> 00:14:45.982
where many young people are saying they don’t want kids.

00:14:47.002 --> 00:14:53.562
To be precise, according to a survey from July last year, July of 2023, in the

00:14:53.582 --> 00:15:00.432
UK, only 55% of Gen Z want to have children, citing factors like wanting time

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:05.752
for themselves, the cost of children, and fears about things like global warming.

00:15:06.962 --> 00:15:12.622
I imagine that you might see some of these factors and these fears around

00:15:12.622 --> 00:15:17.912
you, whether that’s in yourself, in your friends, families, or colleagues.

00:15:18.672 --> 00:15:24.062
It is all around us, because these seemingly distant statistics,

00:15:24.502 --> 00:15:28.672
numbers like “fertility rate”, are merely the results of the decisions

00:15:28.872 --> 00:15:33.232
that millions of people around the world are making every single day.

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:39.282
Now, as to what happens next, it is undeniable that the global

00:15:39.282 --> 00:15:43.872
population is set to decline unless there are any major changes.

00:15:44.972 --> 00:15:47.152
But is this such a bad thing?

00:15:47.972 --> 00:15:52.412
People are free to make their own decisions, nobody should feel obligated to

00:15:52.412 --> 00:15:57.382
have children out of some sort of global duty to not let the population decrease.

00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:03.332
But, on a global scale, as Elon Musk suggested in that tweet

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:07.702
I mentioned at the start, on some levels it is very bad news.

00:16:08.812 --> 00:16:15.262
From a purely economic point of view, if a population decreases, it tends to do so slowly,

00:16:15.692 --> 00:16:22.362
and this is preceded by a large demographic shift, where the old outnumber the young.

00:16:23.022 --> 00:16:24.972
And this is problematic.

00:16:25.682 --> 00:16:30.312
A country needs a working-age population to be able to support a population that

00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:34.962
is unable to work, whether that’s people who are too young to work, because they

00:16:34.962 --> 00:16:39.472
are children and they need to go to school, or because they are too old to work.

00:16:40.492 --> 00:16:45.652
When this happens, there is an increasing burden on the working-age population

00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:50.612
to support the ageing population, for example through higher taxes or

00:16:50.822 --> 00:16:56.272
increased government debt, and the situation can quickly spiral out of control.

00:16:57.792 --> 00:16:59.442
So, what can be done?

00:17:00.012 --> 00:17:06.252
Well, on a national level, you can stop your population decreasing by either encouraging

00:17:06.252 --> 00:17:11.262
citizens to have more babies or by encouraging people to move to your country.

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:17.432
For most countries, the latter is much easier to do, it’s much easier

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:21.642
to encourage immigration than to encourage people to have more children.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.078
In the country that I’ve been a foreigner in for the past 7 years, Malta, the government

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:33.048
has implemented all sorts of parent-friendly policies, such as free childcare,

00:17:33.538 --> 00:17:39.208
but it still has the lowest fertility rate in Europe, and an ageing population.

00:17:40.458 --> 00:17:45.198
So it has looked abroad, by encouraging foreigners to come to the country.

00:17:46.688 --> 00:17:53.918
As a result, there are almost as many foreigners in the workforce as local people, and in many

00:17:53.958 --> 00:18:00.808
private sector companies there are more foreigners than Maltese, more non-Maltese than Maltese.

00:18:02.048 --> 00:18:06.618
And with this comes a whole host of questions about preservation of

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:10.328
national culture and identity, which you will no doubt be aware of.

00:18:11.578 --> 00:18:16.598
So, other than encouraging people to move to a country, what else can be done?

00:18:17.518 --> 00:18:20.868
Well, one option is to encourage people to have more children.

00:18:21.908 --> 00:18:25.268
The most common are some form of economic incentives,

00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:28.658
which lessen the cost burden of having a child.

00:18:29.738 --> 00:18:34.994
But the effectiveness of these, at least in achieving the kind of results that are

00:18:34.994 --> 00:18:39.978
required to bring the fertility rate up close to the replacement rate, is questionable.

00:18:41.346 --> 00:18:46.096
What seems to happen is that when a financial incentive is provided for having

00:18:46.096 --> 00:18:51.576
children, a couple might choose to have children earlier, but they won’t

00:18:51.586 --> 00:18:57.406
necessarily have more children, so it doesn’t address the root cause of the problem.

00:18:58.826 --> 00:19:01.096
And sometimes it doesn’t work at all.

00:19:02.026 --> 00:19:07.966
Japan, for example, has all sorts of financial incentives to try to get its young people

00:19:07.966 --> 00:19:13.366
to have more children, but they have had a very limited impact, exactly like in Malta.

00:19:14.496 --> 00:19:20.126
So it isn’t just a question of cost, and it’s not just a question of economic

00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:25.516
development, as the examples of countries like Israel, Jamaica and Ukraine show.

00:19:27.076 --> 00:19:32.136
In fact, the only factor that has been reliably shown to be correlated

00:19:32.136 --> 00:19:37.376
with the fertility rate is one that might seem blindingly obvious, and

00:19:37.706 --> 00:19:42.316
that is the amount of children that a woman says she wants to have.

00:19:43.726 --> 00:19:49.376
To quote the paper from the Hoover Institution again, “The single best predictor

00:19:49.656 --> 00:19:56.886
for national fertility rates happens to be wanted family size as reported by women”

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.393
In other words, if you want to see how many children will be born in the

00:20:02.393 --> 00:20:08.033
future, ask young women today how many children they say they want to have.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.660
This is of course a reassuring finding.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:19.540
Society should allow for women, and for men for that matter, to have as many or

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:24.600
as little children as they want to have, not force them to have more or less.

00:20:25.997 --> 00:20:31.447
But if that is the case, and if parents don’t want to have as many children

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:36.737
in the 21st century as they did in the 20th, what does that mean for humanity?

00:20:37.727 --> 00:20:42.357
Well, that’s obviously a big question, and one that economists,

00:20:42.547 --> 00:20:45.537
demographers and politicians are all struggling with.

00:20:46.797 --> 00:20:52.157
Technological developments may be the answer, with things like increased automation and

00:20:52.157 --> 00:20:58.407
artificial intelligence allowing for huge productivity increases that offset the reduced working

00:20:58.407 --> 00:21:04.287
age population, meaning that it simply doesn’t matter that there are fewer working age people.

00:21:05.817 --> 00:21:10.177
Some point to less strain on the environment, with fewer people

00:21:10.377 --> 00:21:14.107
leading to a reduction in environmental degradation and pollution.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:20.727
Others point to more manageable cities and towns, with smaller and more connected populations.

00:21:21.807 --> 00:21:26.617
Property would most likely become more affordable, as there would be fewer people

00:21:26.907 --> 00:21:31.957
and the same amount of houses, therefore demand would drop, as would prices.

00:21:33.297 --> 00:21:40.887
Good news for some, perhaps, but it would most likely cause huge economic challenges along the way.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:47.497
The only way to avert it seems to be to find some way of increasing

00:21:47.497 --> 00:21:51.177
the amount of children that young people say they want to have.

00:21:52.677 --> 00:21:55.767
As the American political economist Nicholas Eberstad

00:21:55.787 --> 00:22:01.067
put it, that challenge may be “civilisational in nature”.

00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:08.467
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the world’s shrinking population.

00:22:09.137 --> 00:22:12.007
As a reminder, this was part one of a three-part

00:22:12.017 --> 00:22:15.897
mini-series on the theme of fertility in the 21st century.

00:22:16.547 --> 00:22:20.667
Part two, will be on in vitro fertilisation, or IVF.

00:22:21.334 --> 00:22:25.403
And then part three is going to be on the future of fertility, and

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:29.813
some revolutionary ideas about how babies will be born in the future.

00:22:30.663 --> 00:22:35.263

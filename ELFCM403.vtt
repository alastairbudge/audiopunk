Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:16.251
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.311
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:26.541
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a man who was, at

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:32.291
one point, not just the richest man in America, but the richest man in the world.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:35.011
His name was John D.

00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:35.661
Rockefeller.

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:40.551
Now, I’m sure you have heard this name already, perhaps you already know

00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:45.241
a little bit about him, but in today’s episode we’ll go a little deeper.

00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:49.251
We’ll look at how his childhood, and in particular the

00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:52.361
behaviour of his father, influenced his later life.

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:58.981
We’ll look at how he spotted opportunities and capitalised on them, ultimately becoming the richest

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:05.971
and most powerful person in the country, and we’ll look at how, despite all the efforts to rein him

00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:12.521
in and reduce his power, there was seemingly nothing that could stop his bank balance from going up.

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:20.721
OK then, let’s get right into it and talk about J.D Rockefeller, America’s Richest Man.

00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:27.171
The word “monopoly” comes from Ancient Greek, monos,

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:31.841
meaning single or alone, and pōlein, meaning to sell.

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:37.461
If you look it up in a dictionary you’ll find it defined as something like “a

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:43.521
structure in which a single supplier produces and sells a given product or service”.

00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:49.881
And the first known use of the word “monopoly”, can be traced all the way

00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:55.628
back to the 4th century BC, in Aristotle’s philosophical  work, Politics.

00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:04.438
In this work, Aristotle talks about how another Greek philosopher, Thales of Miletus, cornered the

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:11.388
market of olive presses, the machines used to squeeze the liquid out of olives to make olive oil.

00:02:12.588 --> 00:02:18.498
Thales, according to Aristotle, had correctly predicted that there would be a period of good

00:02:18.498 --> 00:02:25.298
weather, he had agreed in advance to rent all of the olive presses in the local area, and

00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:31.988
when demand to use the olive presses increased, Thales was able to rent them out at a profit.

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:38.218
Now, Thales of Miletus appeared to have little interest in business or making

00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:43.708
money, and he engaged in this monopolistic action as a way to prove a point.

00:02:44.668 --> 00:02:50.292
And, you might point out, having a monopoly over the olive presses in an area of Greece,

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:56.042
well, sure the Ancient Greeks did like their olive oil, but this is not the sort of

00:02:56.202 --> 00:03:01.782
huge, money-printing business that you might think of when you hear the term “monopoly”.

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:10.152
However, fast-forward to the late 19th century, to 1880 to be precise, and we will

00:03:10.152 --> 00:03:16.452
find another oil monopoly, but this one will be in a completely different league.

00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:23.612
One company, called Standard Oil, controlled 90% of the oil refining

00:03:23.612 --> 00:03:27.822
business in the then oil capital of the world, the United States.

00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:33.912
The business owned six and a half thousand kilometres of pipeline, and employed

00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:41.002
100,000 people, so that’s 0.2% of the entire US population at the time.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:48.222
And at the top of it all stood one man, John Davison Rockefeller.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:56.492
By this time, his net worth was an estimated $400 billion in today’s money.

00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:01.732
And for reference, the richest person in the world as of the time

00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:06.982
of making this episode, Elon Musk, is only worth $200 billion.

00:04:08.052 --> 00:04:13.382
But to find out how Rockefeller got there, we need to go right back to the start.

00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:19.682
As you might expect, there were several experiences in young John’s life

00:04:19.952 --> 00:04:25.212
that instilled in him the qualities that would translate into such success.

00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:31.902
He was born on July 8th, 1839, in Richford, New York.

00:04:32.902 --> 00:04:37.822
His father, Bill, was a so-called “botanics salesman”.

00:04:38.512 --> 00:04:45.892
Now, this might sound exotic, legitimate, and something like a herbal doctor, but

00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:52.082
what it really meant was that he was a conman and a trickster; he was a fraud.

00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:59.992
He would travel from town to town selling supposed “miracle remedies”, but they

00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:05.282
would really do nothing at all, and by the time his patients realised this,

00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:10.672
Bill would have skipped town and moved on to look for the next gullible crowd.

00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:18.052
As you might imagine, the nature of Bill’s job meant that he was on the move a lot.

00:05:19.262 --> 00:05:22.502
He would only occasionally return home to his wife and

00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:26.812
kids, sometimes with lots of money, sometimes with none.

00:05:28.252 --> 00:05:34.982
When he did come back, he would even trick and cheat his own children, including John, which

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:41.112
Bill felt was an important lesson a father should teach his children: never trust anyone.

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:46.772
It seems that there were plenty of other reasons for young John not to trust his father.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:51.932
He was, of course, a con man, but he was also having an affair.

00:05:52.692 --> 00:05:57.772
Not just this, but he had somehow persuaded his wife to allow

00:05:57.772 --> 00:06:02.532
his lover to move in with them as their supposed “housekeeper”.

00:06:03.782 --> 00:06:07.792
Bill was clearly a nasty piece of work: disloyal to his

00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:11.922
wife, absent from his family, and mean to his children.

00:06:13.002 --> 00:06:15.202
But John was not like his father.

00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:20.742
And indeed, he looked at his father’s behaviour, from the cheating in business

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:26.632
to the betrayal of his mother, with disgust, and swore to never be like him.

00:06:27.682 --> 00:06:30.472
And, for the most part, he wasn’t.

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:36.292
He started his business career young, doing things like raising

00:06:36.292 --> 00:06:40.752
turkeys for his mother and loaning the money he made to a local farmer.

00:06:42.212 --> 00:06:47.812
It would appear that he got out of the house at the first opportunity, as at the age of

00:06:47.812 --> 00:06:54.912
16 he got his first “real” job, working as an office clerk at a company in Cleveland,

00:06:54.912 --> 00:07:01.062
Ohio, a company that bought, sold, and shipped grain, coal, and other commodities.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:06.042
This was clearly an important step for young John.

00:07:07.012 --> 00:07:12.022
So important, in fact, that he would mark September 26th, the day he

00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:16.902
started this job, with an annual celebration, calling it “Job Day”.

00:07:18.042 --> 00:07:22.822
Now, it wouldn’t be this job that would turn him into the richest person in the world.

00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:30.222
He was paid a measly 50 cents a day, or $17 a day in today’s money.

00:07:31.082 --> 00:07:34.242
But this job would do two things.

00:07:35.272 --> 00:07:41.332
First, he saw how the world of business, in particular transportation, worked.

00:07:41.902 --> 00:07:47.202
He saw behind the scenes, he saw how much stuff cost and how much money

00:07:47.242 --> 00:07:51.192
companies made from it, which would open his eyes to how to make money.

00:07:52.122 --> 00:07:55.952
And secondly, this experience would allow him to make

00:07:55.962 --> 00:07:59.922
a name for himself as an honest and trustworthy person.

00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:06.532
He worked long hours, he was always polite and diligent, and in contrast to his

00:08:06.532 --> 00:08:11.782
professional con artist of a father, he never tricked or overcharged his customers.

00:08:13.252 --> 00:08:18.212
This would give him the confidence that he could run a business himself, and so

00:08:18.452 --> 00:08:24.292
in 1859, at the age of 20, he started his own trading business with a partner.

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:29.322
It was, as you might suspect, a near-immediate success.

00:08:30.102 --> 00:08:33.332
His company bought, sold and transported commodities.

00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:38.692
With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, business

00:08:38.732 --> 00:08:43.292
boomed, as the Union Army enlisted Rockefeller’s logistics services.

00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:49.942
Rockefeller, by the way, was a staunch abolitionist, he was anti-slavery, and

00:08:50.082 --> 00:08:54.732
it’s said that he would have enlisted himself and fought in the war had there

00:08:54.732 --> 00:08:58.322
been someone who could have taken over his responsibilities in the business.

00:08:59.902 --> 00:09:06.012
Wartime business was good, but as the war drew to a close, and with it the

00:09:06.012 --> 00:09:11.592
war-time profits drying up, Rockefeller was on the lookout for a new opportunity.

00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:17.302
This opportunity, it turned out, was right in front of his

00:09:17.302 --> 00:09:21.102
eyes, or under his feet, depending on how you look at it.

00:09:22.358 --> 00:09:22.788
Oil.

00:09:24.618 --> 00:09:28.858
We might now think of the oil capitals of the world to be located

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:33.308
in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, and so on.

00:09:34.488 --> 00:09:39.968
In the mid to late 19th century, however, there was only really one oil capital.

00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:41.868
The United States of America.

00:09:43.328 --> 00:09:49.908
In 1859, crude oil had been discovered in Pennsylvania, and there was a subsequent

00:09:50.118 --> 00:09:55.918
oil rush, with speculators buying up land, laying drills, and hoping that

00:09:55.918 --> 00:10:01.058
they would be greeted by a fountain of black liquid rising up into the air.

00:10:02.448 --> 00:10:06.798
Many of these oil speculators grew spectacularly wealthy.

00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:13.568
Others, on the other hand, lost everything, as they took on large loans or

00:10:13.758 --> 00:10:18.788
invested all of their savings only to find that the land they had thought

00:10:18.948 --> 00:10:24.178
would contain this miracle black gold, contained nothing more than dry earth.

00:10:25.748 --> 00:10:29.008
What’s more, they were completely at the mercy of the

00:10:29.008 --> 00:10:32.678
price of oil, which went up and down like a seesaw.

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:38.438
Rockefeller saw this and thought, well, I could try my hand

00:10:38.438 --> 00:10:42.368
at drilling for the oil myself, but that seems kind of risky.

00:10:42.998 --> 00:10:47.988
Instead, why don’t I deal with the processing and refining of the oil

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:53.118
after it has been discovered, therefore I don’t take on any of the risk,

00:10:53.448 --> 00:10:57.128
and I still have most of the upside, all the money-making potential.

00:10:58.528 --> 00:11:04.328
So, in 1863, shortly after the end of the war, Rockefeller and his

00:11:04.328 --> 00:11:09.278
partners switched from transporting commodities to refining crude oil.

00:11:10.258 --> 00:11:13.768
Remember, the oil that comes directly from the ground needs

00:11:13.768 --> 00:11:17.318
to be processed and standardised so that it can be used.

00:11:17.988 --> 00:11:22.178
An oil “refinery” is an integral part of the oil supply chain.

00:11:23.688 --> 00:11:27.688
And these oil refineries, at least before Rockefeller

00:11:27.688 --> 00:11:31.238
got into the business, were pretty wasteful places.

00:11:32.178 --> 00:11:37.648
They took the crude oil, turned it into kerosene, but they would throw

00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:41.828
away all of the byproducts that were produced during the refining process.

00:11:43.118 --> 00:11:49.468
This was about 40% of the total, and it was simply thrown away, discarded.

00:11:51.008 --> 00:11:54.866
Rockefeller, ever the numbers man, looked at this and

00:11:54.866 --> 00:11:57.886
thought “can we use this waste product for something?

00:11:58.234 --> 00:12:01.239
Is there a way to make money from it rather than throw it away?”

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:04.899
It turned out that there certainly was.

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:09.609
This waste product could be used for everything from creating

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:13.419
tar for roads through to gas to power the refinery itself.

00:12:14.429 --> 00:12:18.019
Instead of being thrown away, it was used or sold,

00:12:18.289 --> 00:12:21.379
which made Rockefeller’s operation much more profitable.

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:26.539
What’s more, he looked at everything that the business did, and did

00:12:26.599 --> 00:12:30.559
everything he could to cut costs: he brought in his own plumbers

00:12:30.559 --> 00:12:34.509
to lay piping and ordered for his own wooden barrels to be built.

00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:42.439
Long story short, Rockefeller was able to reduce his costs significantly and increase his revenues.

00:12:43.199 --> 00:12:45.489
And you don’t have to have been to Harvard Business

00:12:45.489 --> 00:12:48.809
School to know that this is good news for a business.

00:12:49.449 --> 00:12:56.379
But, rather than Rockefeller himself taking huge amounts of money out of the company and sleeping

00:12:56.389 --> 00:13:02.699
on a bed of hundred dollar bills, he ploughed all of his profits back into growing the company.

00:13:03.689 --> 00:13:09.259
He started by buying out his partners, and then went on a buying spree,

00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:14.259
buying up smaller refineries around him, and getting closer and closer to

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:19.519
what Thales of Miletus had achieved in the 4th century BC: an oil monopoly.

00:13:20.659 --> 00:13:25.849
In 1870, he founded the company he would grow to be famous for, Standard Oil.

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:31.689
As Standard Oil grew, Rockefeller was able to continually offer the

00:13:31.689 --> 00:13:36.269
lowest prices in the market, meaning his rivals simply couldn’t compete.

00:13:37.714 --> 00:13:44.349
According to one story, Rockefeller would invite a competitor to his office, open up his books,

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:50.759
his accounts, and let the competitor realise for themself that Standard Oil could continue

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:56.039
to sell oil at rock bottom prices for longer than the competitor could stay in business.

00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:00.439
Essentially, there was no way that other companies could compete.

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:06.799
They could either sell to Rockefeller, and join him, or they would go out of business.

00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:08.949
It really wasn’t much of a choice.

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:15.989
Like a python slithering along the floor, swallowing up animals that got in its

00:14:15.989 --> 00:14:21.909
way, and in the process growing bigger and bigger, Standard Oil continued to grow.

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:28.089
In one four month period alone, in 1872, it bought

00:14:28.229 --> 00:14:32.949
22 of the 26 other oil refineries in Cleveland, Ohio.

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:38.429
Rockefeller also expanded into buying oil pipeline networks.

00:14:38.919 --> 00:14:41.969
This enabled the company to cut off the flow of crude

00:14:41.979 --> 00:14:44.629
oil to refineries that Rockefeller wanted to buy.

00:14:45.869 --> 00:14:50.629
And, when one rival company attempted to build a competing pipeline across

00:14:50.649 --> 00:14:55.719
Pennsylvania, Standard Oil bought up the land along the way to block it.

00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:03.289
In business he was completely cut-throat, he would do whatever it took to enlarge his empire.

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:10.049
Now, although consumers overall liked the lower prices that came from

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:13.969
this, there was an increasing feeling that Standard Oil the company,

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:19.279
and Rockefeller the man, were growing too strong and too powerful.

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:27.679
And, by 1880, it controlled 90% of the oil refining business in the United States.

00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:31.799
It had huge power to negotiate prices, knock down

00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:36.529
suppliers, and–if it wanted–increase prices for consumers.

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:41.649
Ultimately, Rockefeller was forced to restructure Standard Oil,

00:15:42.159 --> 00:15:46.349
ending up dividing it into a “trust”, owned by its shareholder.

00:15:47.729 --> 00:15:51.153
What this meant was that,  in practice, Rockefeller and

00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:55.063
his business partners still owned it, but less directly.

00:15:56.063 --> 00:16:01.183
To make the oil market seem less monopolised by Standard Oil, the Standard

00:16:01.213 --> 00:16:06.593
Oil Trust also created other smaller companies to look like there was

00:16:06.593 --> 00:16:11.793
competition, but these companies were also ultimately owned by Standard Oil.

00:16:13.123 --> 00:16:18.623
Thales of Miletus might have had a temporary monopoly on olive presses in a small

00:16:18.633 --> 00:16:24.813
region of the Mediterranean, but John D Rockefeller had what looked like an unbreakable

00:16:24.823 --> 00:16:29.633
monopoly in the United States on the most sought after commodity in the world.

00:16:30.743 --> 00:16:35.623
By this time the company was hugely profitable, paying out vast

00:16:35.643 --> 00:16:39.673
dividends to Rockefeller and its other shareholders every month.

00:16:40.973 --> 00:16:44.553
But, its success and size would ultimately lead to

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:48.863
legislation against it, and it was disbanded in 1911.

00:16:50.173 --> 00:16:54.700
It was split into 40 different companies, many of which you’ll have heard of

00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:00.023
and are still around today: Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and Marathon, for example.

00:17:01.113 --> 00:17:04.753
Now, apart from the nature of his business and his

00:17:04.753 --> 00:17:08.563
dealmaking, we haven’t heard much yet about John D.

00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:09.983
Rockefeller the man.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:16.790
This is really because he was a very private man, and not a huge amount is known about him.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:24.560
By all accounts he was, if you’ll excuse such a generalisation, a “good man”.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.440
He married a schoolteacher, with whom he had five children.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.630
He was a faithful husband and a loyal father to his children.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:40.930
Throughout his life, he donated heavily to good causes, giving away an estimated $540

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:47.130
million dollars, which if we adjust it to today’s money would be something like $20 billion.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.780
And this is the “problem” of J.D.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:57.730
Rockefeller, or at least the main reason he was and still is a controversial figure.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.300
He was by some calculations the richest man in the history

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.720
of the world, and controlled vast wealth and power.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.050
He was an easy man to point fingers at and say “it is disgraceful for one

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.100
person to amass such wealth while there is such poverty in the world”.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.320
Yet he gave away a huge amount of money to good causes, he did more

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.910
good in terms of his philanthropy than anyone else in recent history.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:34.360
So he has gone down in history as both a robber baron and a philanthropist, a

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.570
legendary businessman and a double-crossing capitalist, someone who built and

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:45.510
standardised a vital industry but put his competitors out of business in the process.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.610
As his biographer wrote, “What makes him problematic is that

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.880
his good side was every bit as good as his bad side was bad.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.320
Seldom has history produced such a contradictory figure.”

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.510
He died in 1937, less than two months away from his 98th birthday.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.470
As a young man he had reportedly said that he had two wishes in life:

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.635
to make a hundred thousand dollars, and to live to the age of 100.

00:19:19.122 --> 00:19:22.820
As to the first one, Rockefeller could have put a few

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.510
zeroes on the end and he would still have got there.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:31.440
In 1913, he was worth around 3% of US GDP, which

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.140
would be almost a trillion dollars in today’s money.

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.480
And as to the second, living to 100, well he almost did

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.610
it, but there are some things in life that money can’t buy.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.790
OK then, that is it for today's episode on J.D Rockefeller | America’s Richest Man.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.680
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:01.060
As always, I would love to know your thoughts about this episode.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.630
What is “too big”?

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.220
Can a monopoly ever be a good thing?

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.140
And are there any Rockefeller-like people in your country?

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.640
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started,

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:17.140
the place for that is, as always, community.leonardoenglish.com

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.970
Oh, and we are actually going to be following up this episode with another one about an American

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:29.040
tycoon, but a very different one this time, Cornelius Vanderbilt, so keep a lookout for that one.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.480
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.860
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe, and I'll catch you in the next episode.

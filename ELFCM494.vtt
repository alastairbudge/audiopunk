Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.839
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.150
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.370
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about the Haitian Revolution.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.930
It is one of the most interesting and important revolutions in world history, and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.670
brings together colonialism, slavery, the French, the Spanish, the British, the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.879
Americans, Napoleon, sugar, extreme violence, revenge, human rights, and more.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.540
As a warning, today’s episode is longer than usual,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.100
but it’s an important one, so I hope you’ll enjoy it.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.990
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and talk about The Haitian Revolution.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.205
If you have some knowledge of English poets, you will have heard of William Wordsworth.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.590
He was the father of the English Romantic movement and is probably

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.609
most famous for writing poems about the English countryside.

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:21.992
But in 1803 he turned his attention to another subject in a poem titled Toussaint L'Ouverture.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.910
The poem started with the line “Toussaint, the most unhappy

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.979
Man of Men!”, and continued to pay tribute to its subject.

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:39.209
Wordsworth never met or knew the man he dedicated the poem

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.820
to, and the two men couldn’t have been more different.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.069
William Wordsworth was born in England, enjoyed a privileged life, studied at Cambridge

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.880
University, and died at home, surrounded by his family, at the ripe old age of 80.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.870
Toussaint L’Ouverture was born on a slave plantation in Saint-Domingue, in modern-day Haiti, and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.200
died at the age of 59 in chains in a freezing French prison, just months after Wordsworth’s poem.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.500
The fact that this Romantic English poet dedicated a poem to him

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.064
gives you some idea of the global impact of Toussaint L’Ouverture.

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:32.049
And we can see this poignantly in the last few verses, as Wordsworth

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.700
wrote about how L’Ouverture would be remembered by generations to come.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.430
There’s not a breathing of the common wind

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.879
That will forget thee; thou hast great allies;

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.340
Thy friends are exultations, agonies,

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.190
And love, and Man’s unconquerable mind.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.340
In other words, what you have done will be remembered forever.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.749
So, what exactly is the story of Toussaint L’Ouverture?

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:06.880
Well, to understand his story, and the story of the Haitian

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.490
Revolution, we need to go back several hundred years.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.148
In the middle of the Caribbean lies its second-largest island, Hispaniola.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.249
The indigenous inhabitants of the island were the Taíno people, but the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.230
name for the island, Hispaniola, gives you a clue as to who they were

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.010
greeted by on December 6th, 1492: Christopher Columbus and the Spanish.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.600
The Spanish were initially quite interested in the island, and its potential

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.550
as a source of gold, but their interest soon waned after it became clear that

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.650
greater riches could be found on the mainland, in Central and South America.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.649
The island turned into a sort of trading and piracy outpost, a place where

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.280
Caribbean pirates would go to sell their stolen goods or stock up on food.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.689
The Western part of the island in particular was left practically abandoned.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.840
And, lest we forget, the native Taíno population had been pretty much wiped

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.090
out by a combination of forced labour and diseases brought in by the Spanish.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.299
Fast forward to 1697 and the Spanish agreed to hand over the Western

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.095
part of the island to the French, who renamed it Saint-Domingue.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.820
And the French did not neglect it.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.940
They turned it into a huge colonial outpost with masses of

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.106
plantations, producing sugar, coffee, cotton, indigo and cacao.

00:04:51.095 --> 00:04:54.930
It was a particularly important centre for sugar production, and

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:59.690
soon this western part of Hispaniola, the now French colony of

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.170
Saint-Domingue, was producing 40% of all of the sugar consumed in Europe.

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:12.990
And as you might expect, it was not the native French who were toiling away in the plantations.

00:05:13.942 --> 00:05:18.560
This gruelling work was being done by the hundreds of thousands of African

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.319
slaves who had been brought to the island with the sole purpose of working in

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.199
the plantations until they dropped dead of exhaustion, disease, or malnutrition.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.540
And drop dead they did.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.070
Most slaves in Saint-Domingue didn’t live past their 21st birthday, and slaves

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.330
who arrived on the island typically wouldn’t last more than 2 or 3 years.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:54.019
It's hard to overstate quite how brutal this regime was, but the fact that it was considered a

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:59.789
waste for slave owners to spend any time caring for their slaves because it was cheaper to buy a

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:07.599
new one to replace a dead one, well this gives you an idea of the level of inhumanity on the island.

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:15.159
It was a brutal system, but to portray it simply as French whites as slave

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:20.019
owners and African slaves toiling on the plantations is a simplification.

00:06:21.429 --> 00:06:26.299
There were really four main groups of people on the island, and as

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:30.959
we will see, they all had different goals and different perspectives.

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.589
At the top of the tree were the slave-owning whites,

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:39.689
the so-called “big whites”, or grand blancs in French.

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:46.549
These were the people who owned the plantations, the people who profited from the slave labour.

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.939
Some of them lived on the island, while others lived back in

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:55.629
France and simply collected the money from the plantations.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:00.569
Below them were the “small whites”, or “petit blancs”.

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:07.189
These were the French people who had come to the island to work; they did managerial

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:12.939
or administrative work, or they would work on the plantations as field managers.

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.689
They didn’t own plantations, but they were still

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:20.579
considered superior to the slaves, given their skin colour.

00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:27.359
Below them again, but in some respects their equal, were the

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:31.339
“gens de couleur libres”, the “free people of colour” in English.

00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:40.549
These were people who were of mixed race, typically children of a French father and a

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:46.749
slave mother, or people who at some point in their family history had slave ancestry.

00:07:47.739 --> 00:07:52.389
There were few French women in Saint-Domingue, and unfortunately, this

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:56.879
meant that rape and sexual assault by the whites on slaves were common.

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:02.009
And if this resulted in a child, the white plantation owner would typically

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:08.179
free or even marry the female slave, and she and her children would become free.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:14.119
Importantly, this class, the “gens de couleur libres”, were free; they

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:18.899
could even own plantations and keep slaves themselves, but they were

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:23.579
not granted rights like the ability to vote or hold political office.

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:31.899
And right at the bottom of the pile were the most unfortunate of the lot, the slaves, who had

00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:37.919
absolutely no rights at all, they were property and lived in the most abominable of conditions.

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:42.889
So you have this unusual system of these different groups of people,

00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:47.539
all of whom interfacing with each other to a certain extent, all

00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:51.689
of whose interests will complicate matters as this story develops.

00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:57.889
And just in terms of numbers, the grand and petit blancs, the whites

00:08:57.899 --> 00:09:03.739
essentially, were in a serious minority; they made up about 8% of the population.

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:13.409
The mixed-race population was around 5%, and the remaining just under 90% were the African slaves.

00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:19.249
And these slaves were almost all African, they were born in Africa,

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:23.769
transported to Haiti, lived for a short period and died there.

00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:30.539
At the time of the Haitian Revolution, so the late 18th century, practically all

00:09:30.549 --> 00:09:36.149
of the slaves were born in Africa for the simple but awful reason that the life

00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:41.639
expectancy of a slave in Haiti was so short that they had to be constantly replaced.

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:46.019
And to give you an idea of the number of people we’re talking about

00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:51.949
here, there were around 500,000 slaves and fewer than 50,000 whites.

00:09:53.489 --> 00:09:58.129
Now, these conditions created a dangerous powder keg, a

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:01.999
bonfire ready to explode in flames at the drop of a match.

00:10:02.889 --> 00:10:07.799
You had a tiny minority that controlled a majority and subjected

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:12.639
it to the most terrible of conditions based on skin colour alone.

00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:19.395
And what’s more, you had these two other groups, the petit blancs and the gens

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:24.589
de couleur libres, the small whites and the mixed-race population, who were

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:29.679
stuck in between the grand blancs and the slaves, and they despised each other.

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:35.639
That might well have been enough to trigger a revolution, but these conditions

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:40.649
were not so different to those that existed in other slave-owning countries.

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:45.449
What pushed things over the edge, the final spark that lit

00:10:45.449 --> 00:10:49.849
the fire, in fact came from across the seas, in France.

00:10:51.073 --> 00:10:57.963
The French Revolution started in 1789 and continued on and off for 10 years.

00:10:59.043 --> 00:11:04.203
One of the main ideas of the revolution was freedom and equality for

00:11:04.233 --> 00:11:11.103
all men, and indeed on August 26th, 1789, The Declaration of the Rights

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:16.023
of Man and of the Citizen set out clearly what these rights were.

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:22.023
There were 17 in total, and the first one set the tone:

00:11:22.943 --> 00:11:27.033
“Men are born and remain free and equal in rights.

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:32.043
Social distinctions may be founded only upon the general good.”

00:11:33.383 --> 00:11:34.973
It is a simple idea.

00:11:35.383 --> 00:11:38.323
It might have been controversial at the time, but

00:11:38.573 --> 00:11:42.113
it was easy for anyone to understand what it meant.

00:11:43.563 --> 00:11:47.513
And this revolutionary idea of equality and freedom,

00:11:47.863 --> 00:11:51.363
and news of the French Revolution, spread quickly.

00:11:52.683 --> 00:11:55.873
It didn’t take long for word of it to arrive in

00:11:55.873 --> 00:11:59.313
Saint-Domingue, which, let’s remember, was a French colony.

00:12:00.713 --> 00:12:06.163
And it was received in different ways by the four principal groups on the island.

00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:10.573
For the slaves, clearly it was a message of hope.

00:12:11.203 --> 00:12:16.603
Slavery was incompatible with “men remaining free”, so surely

00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:19.773
this must mean that their freedom would soon be declared?

00:12:21.193 --> 00:12:26.043
For the gens de couleur libres, the free mixed-race population, it was

00:12:26.073 --> 00:12:30.103
encouraging news because it would mean that they could do things like vote

00:12:30.363 --> 00:12:34.673
and stand in elections, which their skin colour did not allow them to do.

00:12:35.693 --> 00:12:41.933
But it was also slightly concerning, as much of this mixed-race population owned

00:12:41.933 --> 00:12:47.923
slaves, so if slavery was abolished, this would result in a major loss of earnings.

00:12:49.253 --> 00:12:55.003
For the petit-blancs and to an even greater extent the grand blancs, it was a frightening prospect.

00:12:55.713 --> 00:13:00.823
The entire society of Saint-Domingue was structured on men not being free and

00:13:00.823 --> 00:13:07.633
equal, on the blood, sweat and tears of African slaves, and if suddenly these people

00:13:07.633 --> 00:13:12.025
were declared equal, well the good times would be over for the white population.

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:18.545
And they presumably knew that liberating the black slave population would not be as

00:13:18.545 --> 00:13:24.205
simple as declaring their freedom and everyone shaking hands and being friends again; the

00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:29.715
whites had subjected the slaves to the most horrendous treatment over hundreds of years.

00:13:30.645 --> 00:13:33.485
The treatment of the slaves by their white masters in

00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:38.325
Saint-Domingue was particularly brutal even by slavery standards.

00:13:38.785 --> 00:13:44.195
Punishments were awful, arms and legs chopped off, whippings were

00:13:44.215 --> 00:13:48.985
common, control was maintained by an atmosphere of constant fear.

00:13:49.645 --> 00:13:52.665
The slaves would surely want revenge.

00:13:53.585 --> 00:13:59.285
Even the idea that the black slaves could think that one day they might be free was a scary one.

00:14:00.135 --> 00:14:05.885
The whites were grossly outnumbered, by more than 10 to 1, and they feared the potential for an

00:14:05.895 --> 00:14:11.715
uprising if there was even the whiff of freedom, the slightest sense that freedom was possible.

00:14:13.265 --> 00:14:17.225
The white slave owners, the grand-blancs, hadn’t previously

00:14:17.225 --> 00:14:21.645
believed that the slaves were even capable of rising up en masse.

00:14:22.595 --> 00:14:26.525
They understood that there would always be a few that would try to run away

00:14:26.535 --> 00:14:31.765
or fight back, but they would be publicly executed as an example to others.

00:14:32.165 --> 00:14:35.955
They didn’t believe that the slaves were capable of organising themselves.

00:14:37.395 --> 00:14:42.295
For starters, there really weren’t many examples of wide-scale slave rebellions.

00:14:43.225 --> 00:14:48.985
Secondly, they believed that the slaves were mentally incapable of organising themselves.

00:14:50.415 --> 00:14:56.405
Slavery requires you to believe that one person is inferior to another by dint

00:14:56.405 --> 00:15:01.255
of their race, and the whites believed that the African slaves were just not

00:15:01.275 --> 00:15:06.775
capable of organising themselves, that they lacked the mental capacity to do so.

00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:13.935
As you will see, they were grossly mistaken, and they vastly underestimated the people

00:15:14.105 --> 00:15:20.307
they thought years of slavery and abuse had turned into docile, incapable subhumans.

00:15:21.965 --> 00:15:26.475
The first act of rebellion came not from the slaves, though, but from

00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:30.715
a gens de couleur libres, a mixed-race citizen of Saint-Domingue.

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:38.545
A man called Vincent Ogé had been born in Saint-Domingue, and he was a member of the colonial elite.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:43.285
He was a rich and powerful man, but he was mixed race,

00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:46.995
which automatically disqualified him from certain rights.

00:15:48.665 --> 00:15:53.905
He was actually in France at the time of the revolution, and he petitioned the new

00:15:54.165 --> 00:15:59.455
Assembly General in France to allow mixed-race people the same rights as white people.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:03.645
The Assembly General granted this, passing it into law.

00:16:04.935 --> 00:16:09.965
But when he returned to Saint-Domingue in 1790, he found

00:16:09.995 --> 00:16:13.765
that the governor general simply ignored it, he said “nope”.

00:16:15.325 --> 00:16:22.065
Vincent Ogé enlisted a group of mixed-race soldiers, and they rose up in protest.

00:16:23.145 --> 00:16:27.395
Now, it’s important to underline that what Ogé was requesting wasn’t the

00:16:27.455 --> 00:16:32.395
abolition of slavery or equal rights for slaves or independence from France.

00:16:32.835 --> 00:16:36.435
He was a plantation owner himself, he owned slaves.

00:16:37.285 --> 00:16:42.285
All he wanted was the same rights as white people for people like him, mixed

00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:46.795
race people, not the abolition of slavery or improved rights for slaves.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.770
And, not of course that it should matter, but Ogé was much more white than he was black.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:17:01.160
His father was a white Frenchman, his mother was mixed race, so she was half white and half black,

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:08.080
and if you look at a portrait of him, he was inseparable from any other white French aristocrat.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.925
But this really gives you a sense of quite how much race underpinned everything in Saint-Domingue.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.340
There were detailed measurements of how black someone was, and if you were anything

00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:26.400
less than 100% white, you didn’t have the same rights as the white population.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.450
Now, back to Ogé.

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.190
Although what he was asking for, and indeed what had been approved by the

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.910
French Assembly General, might not have seemed like such a big thing, it was

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:45.960
rejected by the colonial administration, and his uprising was swiftly put down.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.690
A month after he rose up, he was captured, and then in February of the following year,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:18:01.200
February 1791, he was brutally publicly executed by being broken on the wheel, all of his

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.710
bones agonisingly broken before his head was chopped off and put on a pike for all to see.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.680
If the white colonial administrators thought this would

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:17.070
be sufficient to quash the uprising, they would be wrong.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:23.243
Six months later, on the evening of the 21st of August of 1791,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.626
everything would change in Saint-Domingue There was a secret voodoo

00:18:28.626 --> 00:18:33.016
ceremony led by a slave and religious leader called Dutty Boukman.

00:18:34.366 --> 00:18:40.466
During the ceremony, he called for a full-out rebellion against the plantation owners.

00:18:41.416 --> 00:18:48.346
And as he made this plea, there was a tropical storm, thunder and lightning filling the sky.

00:18:49.966 --> 00:18:55.536
This was seen as a sign to take action, that change was afoot.

00:18:56.816 --> 00:19:01.696
Slaves rose up, slaughtering their colonial masters in their beds.

00:19:02.236 --> 00:19:06.746
They set fire to the sugar plantations, burning the crops and destroying

00:19:06.746 --> 00:19:11.066
the sugar plants that they had been forced to harvest, day in, day out.

00:19:12.386 --> 00:19:17.286
Saint-Domingue was a small place, and fires could be seen all over the island.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:21.696
Smoke and screams filled the air, as slaves in their

00:19:21.766 --> 00:19:25.236
thousands rose up against their former oppressors.

00:19:26.616 --> 00:19:33.786
Within a couple of weeks, more than 100,000 slaves had joined in the revolt, and the island was

00:19:33.786 --> 00:19:40.296
split into areas controlled by the slaves and small patches to which the whites had retreated.

00:19:41.796 --> 00:19:46.196
And when they met, the violence was extreme, on both sides.

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:51.376
Men, women and children were killed in the most awful of ways.

00:19:52.046 --> 00:19:56.466
The slaves, perfectly understandably, were out for blood after

00:19:56.496 --> 00:20:00.436
being so hideously mistreated by their white colonial masters.

00:20:01.786 --> 00:20:06.036
And the whites had always been extremely violent towards the slave

00:20:06.036 --> 00:20:10.786
population, and were even more so now that they had risen up.

00:20:12.246 --> 00:20:15.616
But risen up against what, exactly?

00:20:16.656 --> 00:20:20.696
It's here that it gets a little complicated, and again we must

00:20:20.716 --> 00:20:23.886
remember the different groups and their different interests.

00:20:24.826 --> 00:20:26.036
What did the slaves want?

00:20:26.586 --> 00:20:30.336
Well, they wanted to be free, and they believed that the

00:20:30.336 --> 00:20:34.086
Declaration of the Rights Of Man had declared them to be free.

00:20:34.746 --> 00:20:38.666
They weren’t demanding independence from France, they weren’t demanding that

00:20:38.666 --> 00:20:43.416
the white population leave the island, all they wanted was not to be enslaved.

00:20:44.686 --> 00:20:47.706
And what did the grand-blancs, the slave owners, want?

00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:53.566
Well, they didn’t want the end of slavery, because it was a vastly profitable enterprise for them.

00:20:54.786 --> 00:20:59.586
Similarly, the gens de couleur libres, the free people of colour, they

00:20:59.586 --> 00:21:04.726
weren’t opposed to slavery per se, but they wanted the right to vote.

00:21:05.946 --> 00:21:12.526
And the petit-blancs, the professional white class, certainly didn’t want the end of slavery nor

00:21:12.686 --> 00:21:17.876
did they want the gens de couleur libres, the mixed-race people, to be granted the right to vote.

00:21:19.176 --> 00:21:24.836
And there was also this curious relationship between Saint-Domingue and France.

00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:29.196
Saint-Domingue was part of France, but the different

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:32.906
groups of the colony looked at France in different ways.

00:21:34.265 --> 00:21:37.945
Initially, most of the slaves looked at France in a

00:21:37.955 --> 00:21:41.291
similar way to Vincent Ogé, as a potential saviour.

00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:47.935
France had declared itself to be a republic that respected the universal rights of man,

00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:54.165
and the idea that no one man was superior to another based on the colour of his skin.

00:21:55.745 --> 00:22:00.895
The grand blancs, on the other hand, looked to France as a dangerous republic.

00:22:01.585 --> 00:22:06.215
The revolution had resulted in this dangerous declaration and it looked

00:22:06.245 --> 00:22:09.745
like France was going to give mixed-race citizens the right to vote.

00:22:10.575 --> 00:22:16.835
This was a dangerous stepping stone, and there were powerful voices among the colonial population

00:22:17.215 --> 00:22:24.265
that sought to declare independence from France, turning Saint-Domingue into an independent country.

00:22:25.685 --> 00:22:28.365
And then, as if things weren’t complicated enough

00:22:28.365 --> 00:22:33.895
already, in 1793 France declared war on Great Britain.

00:22:35.485 --> 00:22:38.425
Now, why is this relevant to the Haitian Revolution?

00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:43.965
Well, firstly it meant that France’s military resources were stretched.

00:22:44.445 --> 00:22:49.975
They were now fighting a full-on war in Europe, which was expensive and labour-intensive.

00:22:51.235 --> 00:22:54.925
It also presented an opportunity for the British, who found an

00:22:54.945 --> 00:22:59.842
unlikely ally in the white French, the grand-blancs, of Saint-Domingue.

00:23:01.195 --> 00:23:06.615
The grand-blancs wrote to the British and requested them to come and declare sovereignty

00:23:06.945 --> 00:23:12.505
over Saint-Domingue, essentially turning this French colony into a British colony.

00:23:13.885 --> 00:23:18.115
The reason for this was not a military one, but because they

00:23:18.115 --> 00:23:21.955
thought that the British were less likely to abolish slavery.

00:23:23.215 --> 00:23:25.665
It seemed like a good deal for the British.

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:31.315
They would take control of a lucrative trading outpost, the so-called “jewel

00:23:31.315 --> 00:23:36.155
of the Caribbean”, it would result in a large loss of revenue for France, and

00:23:36.325 --> 00:23:40.475
if they could put down the slave revolt in Saint-Domingue it would also reduce

00:23:40.475 --> 00:23:45.345
the probability of a similar slave revolt in British slave-powered colonies.

00:23:46.685 --> 00:23:53.005
Britain went along with this, and sent troops to Saint-Domingue, but it was a disaster.

00:23:54.415 --> 00:23:58.605
The British troops couldn’t handle it, and died in their thousands,

00:23:58.905 --> 00:24:03.565
primarily from tropical diseases, not in combat with the rebel slaves.

00:24:04.535 --> 00:24:10.885
But to make matters even more complicated, the Spanish also declared war on France.

00:24:12.275 --> 00:24:15.335
And let’s remember that the eastern side of the

00:24:15.335 --> 00:24:18.925
island of Hispaniola was still under Spanish control.

00:24:19.875 --> 00:24:23.165
So, let’s pause and take stock for a minute.

00:24:24.045 --> 00:24:29.295
There are the British and the Spanish who are at war with France in Europe, and

00:24:29.535 --> 00:24:35.615
are both fighting with and fighting against France in the Caribbean, in Hispaniola.

00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:42.885
We have the grand-blancs, the plantation owners, who are French but have attempted to ally

00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:47.135
with the British, because they believe they are more likely to put down the rebellion.

00:24:47.775 --> 00:24:53.055
We have the slaves who are in control of most of the island, seeking the abolishment of slavery.

00:24:54.225 --> 00:24:59.115
And at this point, the slaves are not particularly organised.

00:24:59.755 --> 00:25:04.705
Their advantage is in number; they outnumber the whites by a factor of

00:25:04.705 --> 00:25:10.075
10 to 1, but they don’t have a particularly coherent vision or strategy.

00:25:10.925 --> 00:25:15.045
Nor do they have one single leader, a force to rally behind.

00:25:15.705 --> 00:25:19.585
There are some leaders of the movement, but they all want slightly

00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:24.080
different things, they aren’t able to unite every slave in Saint-Domingue.

00:25:25.015 --> 00:25:30.175
But it’s here that we need to meet, again, a man who will give them one.

00:25:31.305 --> 00:25:36.105
Toussaint L’Ouverture, the subject of the Wordsworth poem at the start of the episode.

00:25:37.615 --> 00:25:42.845
Importantly, Toussaint L’Ouverture was not a slave at the time of the revolution.

00:25:43.685 --> 00:25:50.265
He was born into slavery, both his parents had been sold into slavery and been transported from

00:25:50.265 --> 00:25:56.585
West Africa, but Toussaint was born on a plantation in Saint-Domingue, he was born a slave.

00:25:58.115 --> 00:26:03.995
However, he showed intelligence and skill from an early age, and was freed, most

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:11.160
probably in his early 30s, so he became a gens de coleur libres, a free person of colour.

00:26:11.745 --> 00:26:16.145
And he did what many free people of colour did if they had the means.

00:26:16.735 --> 00:26:21.245
He managed a plantation, and was a slave owner himself.

00:26:22.515 --> 00:26:27.165
In the early days of the revolution, the early years in fact, Toussaint

00:26:27.165 --> 00:26:32.995
L’Ouverture played quite a canny game, he didn’t try to put himself forward as a

00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:37.855
leader, and instead supported several other people who were jostling for power.

00:26:39.315 --> 00:26:44.425
But by the mid-1790s, so almost five years into the

00:26:44.425 --> 00:26:48.705
revolution, he started to emerge as a key military leader.

00:26:49.585 --> 00:26:54.405
He was sharp, charismatic, and an adept military commander.

00:26:55.485 --> 00:27:01.485
In fact, his surname, “L’Ouverture”, which means “opening” in French, is

00:27:01.515 --> 00:27:06.095
believed to have come from his ability to find openings in his enemies’ lines.

00:27:07.165 --> 00:27:11.155
But if you were thinking that, now under the promising leadership

00:27:11.305 --> 00:27:14.855
of Toussaint L’Ouverture, the timeline of the Haitian revolution

00:27:15.075 --> 00:27:18.965
was going to get simpler, I am afraid I have some bad news for you.

00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:26.545
L’Ouverture was a skilled diplomat, but this meant a ping-pong-esque flipping

00:27:26.725 --> 00:27:31.025
from one side to the other in terms of who the slaves were allied with.

00:27:31.866 --> 00:27:35.465
First it was the Spanish, because they provided military

00:27:35.465 --> 00:27:37.925
support against the French colonial administration.

00:27:38.638 --> 00:27:45.518
Then, in May of 1794, he switched allegiance to the French Republic, to France.

00:27:46.638 --> 00:27:51.528
The key reason for this switch was that the Republic of France had, in

00:27:51.568 --> 00:27:56.868
February of 1794, done what the slave population of Saint-Domingue were

00:27:56.878 --> 00:28:01.738
fighting for: they had formally announced the abolition of slavery.

00:28:02.408 --> 00:28:09.568
And, let’s remember, Saint-Domingue was part of France, so with one stroke of the pen, the half a

00:28:09.568 --> 00:28:16.398
million slaves of Saint-Domingue suddenly became, theoretically at least, free citizens of France.

00:28:17.788 --> 00:28:23.798
By switching allegiance from Spain to France he was allying himself with the home

00:28:23.798 --> 00:28:29.008
country, with freedom and with the emancipation of the slaves of Saint-Domingue.

00:28:30.178 --> 00:28:33.828
Now, he was fighting the Spanish and the British.

00:28:35.108 --> 00:28:39.168
Fortunately for L’Ouverture, the Spanish were not so interested

00:28:39.318 --> 00:28:44.349
in Saint-Domingue, and a peace treaty was signed in July of 1795.

00:28:45.418 --> 00:28:51.788
And as for the British, yes Saint-Domingue was still of interest, but there were more important

00:28:51.808 --> 00:28:59.698
wars to be fighting back in Europe, and by August of 1798, after repeated losses to L’Ouverture’s

00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:06.378
by now well-drilled forces, the British cut their losses and left Saint-Domingue for good.

00:29:07.678 --> 00:29:11.441
But if you were thinking that that was it, no no, there is more.

00:29:12.337 --> 00:29:20.508
In 1799, a then 30-year-old Frenchman called Napoleon Bonaparte declared himself to be

00:29:20.518 --> 00:29:26.758
First Consul of France, essentially the leader of the country, and passed a new constitution

00:29:27.078 --> 00:29:33.368
declaring that French colonies–such as Saint-Domingue–would be subject to special new laws.

00:29:34.348 --> 00:29:38.678
He assured L’Ouverture that this wouldn’t mean the reintroduction

00:29:38.678 --> 00:29:43.728
of slavery, but not everyone bought this, not everyone believed him.

00:29:45.058 --> 00:29:49.573
L’Ouverture then took steps to consolidate his power in Saint-Domingue.

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:55.318
He invaded the eastern half of the island, the Spanish bit, in January of 1801.

00:29:56.078 --> 00:30:01.598
There was practically no Spanish resistance, and L’Ouverture immediately declared it to

00:30:01.598 --> 00:30:08.308
be part of France, meaning that he was now in control of the entire island of Hispaniola.

00:30:09.648 --> 00:30:14.218
And later on that year, in July of 1801, he appointed

00:30:14.228 --> 00:30:17.558
a new assembly and announced a new constitution.

00:30:18.908 --> 00:30:23.348
In this he declared himself to be not just governor-general of the island,

00:30:23.538 --> 00:30:28.468
but governor-general for life with special power to appoint a successor.

00:30:29.768 --> 00:30:34.488
This was a clear affront to central power, to Napoleon.

00:30:36.038 --> 00:30:42.888
Although L’Ouverture professed his loyalty to France and to Napoleon, Napoleon proceeded to send

00:30:42.958 --> 00:30:50.068
20,000 French soldiers to take control of the island and restore it fully under French control.

00:30:51.338 --> 00:30:56.958
The idea was for this to be a show of force, and for negotiations to be peaceful.

00:30:57.928 --> 00:31:03.628
After all, this was France against France, in theory, L’Ouverture had professed his

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:09.798
loyalty to Napoleon and to France, so a diplomatic resolution should have been possible.

00:31:10.748 --> 00:31:11.948
It was not to be.

00:31:12.688 --> 00:31:17.528
A French general ordered his troops to attack a major port, and what resulted

00:31:17.538 --> 00:31:23.107
were months of violent guerilla fighting, side-switching, trickery, and more.

00:31:24.288 --> 00:31:27.558
And when two of his key lieutenants defected to

00:31:27.558 --> 00:31:31.379
France, LOuverture handed himself over to the French.

00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:36.459
Or rather, he negotiated a settlement in which he acknowledged the authority of the

00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:43.339
French generals, and received assurances that he and his generals would be given amnesty.

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.219
Unfortunately, they weren’t.

00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:50.729
In the summer of 1802, L’Ouverture was deported to France

00:31:50.969 --> 00:31:54.289
and imprisoned in a mountain fortress in eastern France.

00:31:55.009 --> 00:31:58.609
He didn’t last long, and within a year he would be dead.

00:31:59.419 --> 00:32:01.226
But what of Saint-Domingue?

00:32:01.779 --> 00:32:08.389
The fighting continued, and the cruelty and viciousness of the punishments ratcheted up a notch.

00:32:09.489 --> 00:32:15.889
Whenever the French managed to capture some Saint-Domingue forces, they would execute them en masse.

00:32:16.679 --> 00:32:21.869
Sometimes it would be by firing squad, sometimes it would be by tying

00:32:21.869 --> 00:32:26.109
them in a bag and throwing them into the sea, they even started locking

00:32:26.109 --> 00:32:31.419
them in the hulls of ships and killing them with poisonous sulphur gas.

00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:38.859
But the residents of Saint-Domingue had one thing on their side, something that had been extremely

00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:45.639
helpful in the fight against the British: tropical diseases, and in particular, yellow fever.

00:32:46.589 --> 00:32:50.289
It was killing the French in their dozens, and before

00:32:50.289 --> 00:32:54.089
long the French were down to only a few thousand troops.

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:59.329
And the violence increased to almost unimaginable levels.

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:05.959
The French imported a reported 15,000 attack dogs from Jamaica,

00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:10.599
dogs that had been trained specifically to attack black people.

00:33:11.899 --> 00:33:17.789
On his deathbed, the French military commander Charles Leclerc gave an order for all

00:33:17.819 --> 00:33:23.639
black people on the island to be killed, and there was the most atrocious violence.

00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:30.739
The rebels, naturally, responded with similar violence, publicly executing any

00:33:30.739 --> 00:33:35.389
Frenchman they got their hands on, chopping them up and putting their heads on sticks.

00:33:36.689 --> 00:33:42.289
By the autumn of 1803 it was clear that this was an unwinnable fight for the

00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:49.319
French, and on the evening of November 30th, 1803, they retreated from the island.

00:33:50.719 --> 00:33:58.419
And on January 1st, 1804, the general in charge of the rebels, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, officially

00:33:58.419 --> 00:34:05.479
declared Saint-Domingue to be an independent country, named not Saint-Domingue, but Haiti.

00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:12.729
It was, as you may know, the first free black-led nation in the world, and

00:34:13.019 --> 00:34:18.089
to this day is the only country to successfully come from a slave rebellion.

00:34:19.279 --> 00:34:24.089
The story of Haiti since then, as you may know, is not so rosy.

00:34:24.789 --> 00:34:28.399
And indeed our next episode is going to be on the various reasons

00:34:28.579 --> 00:34:32.229
that Haiti has remained in such an economically precarious position.

00:34:33.379 --> 00:34:39.479
But as to the story of the revolution of Haiti, it is nothing less than inspiring.

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:45.349
It cost tens of thousands of lives, many of which were lost in acts of unspeakable

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:51.199
violence, it involved treachery and side swapping and was of course all centred

00:34:51.229 --> 00:34:56.559
around the grisly question of the morality and legality of the business of slavery.

00:34:57.379 --> 00:35:01.879
But the slaves emerged victorious, a new country was established,

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:08.459
and an example was set to free and enslaved people around the world.

00:35:11.149 --> 00:35:15.339
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Haitian Revolution.

00:35:15.649 --> 00:35:19.585
I know it was a lot longer than normal, but it could have been 10 times

00:35:19.585 --> 00:35:22.829
longer and we still would have missed out on some important parts.

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:28.039
But I hope that it gave you some useful background, and you might now feel

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:32.229
inspired to explore this fascinating story in greater detail yourself.

00:35:33.339 --> 00:35:38.799
We will be dealing with post-revolutionary Haiti in detail in the next episode, and trying to

00:35:38.799 --> 00:35:43.449
answer the question of why Haiti has failed to live up to the promises and hope of the revolution.

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:48.519

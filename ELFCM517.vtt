Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.379
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.650
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.650
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about economics, colonialism,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.129
development, and one of the most sought-after prizes in academia: the Nobel Prize.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.550
In October this year, three economists won the top prize in economics for

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.330
groundbreaking work into the root cause of a country’s prosperity, or lack of it.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.380
Their theories are fascinating, so in the next 20 minutes or so we’ll talk about

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.620
what they are, what they mean, and hear about some thought-provoking examples.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.680
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.420
What makes one country rich and another one poor?

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.410
Is it geography, such as having the right climate, not too hot,

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:13.750
not too cold, the right amount of coastline and navigable rivers?

00:01:14.809 --> 00:01:16.840
Is it to do with the countries around them?

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:20.650
Is it to do with the cultural history of a country?

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.760
Does language play a part?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.550
It is a hugely important question to which economists have been proposing theories

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.640
for decades, each new theory supported by compelling evidence and examples.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.809
One thing that almost all economists agree on is that strong institutions

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.698
and a strong rule of law are fundamental to a country’s prosperity.

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:54.928
In other words, citizens have to trust that they will be treated fairly and that

00:01:54.928 --> 00:02:00.808
the state exists to support them, not hinder them or extract value from them.

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:04.548
It sounds obvious on one level.

00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:11.088
If there is one country controlled by warlords and gangs, where the police are corrupt

00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:17.908
and the state cannot be trusted, and another with regular free elections, a trustworthy

00:02:17.918 --> 00:02:22.758
legal system, and a functioning bureaucracy and government, it would be difficult

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:27.848
to find an economist who would argue that the former would be the more prosperous.

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.549
Take practically any rich country and it has strong institutions.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:40.139
Sure, they might not be perfect, but if you were to plot a graph with

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.068
the wealth of a country on one axis and the strength of its institutions

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:49.688
on the other, you would find a strong correlation between the two.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:57.028
Wealthier countries have stronger institutions, poorer countries have weaker institutions.

00:02:58.078 --> 00:03:06.148
But, and here is an important question, is a country’s prosperity created by its

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:13.148
strong institutions, or are strong institutions created by a country’s prosperity?

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:18.888
You could find many other characteristics that are shared by rich countries, such

00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:26.258
as high life expectancy or even the abundance of golf courses, but these are things

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:31.928
that are a result of prosperity and economic development rather than causes of it.

00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:39.045
So, the question is, when it comes to strong institutions and the rule of law, do these

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:46.055
facilitate a country’s prosperity, or do they naturally come with increased levels of prosperity?

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:49.555
Do they cause them or are they correlated with them?

00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:55.505
To try to answer this question, in the context of the broader and

00:03:55.515 --> 00:03:59.065
more important question of why some countries are rich and others

00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:04.625
are poor, three prominent economists started research into the topic.

00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:12.065
They were Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish economist working at MIT, the Massachusetts

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:17.435
Institute of Technology, Simon Johnson, a British economist also working at

00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:23.235
MIT, and James Robinson, an American economist from the University of Chicago.

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:30.591
Over two decades ago, these economists focussed their research on trying to

00:04:30.621 --> 00:04:36.931
understand why some countries have weak institutions and others have strong

00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:42.914
institutions, and what this tells us [if anything] about their economic development.

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:51.124
Fast forward to today, or rather to the 14th of October, 2024, and they

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:56.324
were rewarded with the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences.

00:04:57.694 --> 00:05:01.494
You might not know that name, but you will probably know what

00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:05.834
it is more commonly called: The Nobel Prize for Economics.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:14.040
So, what did they find, and why was it considered worthy of the highest accolade in academia?

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.545
Well, they looked at the problem and came up with a novel way of approaching it.

00:05:22.575 --> 00:05:27.135
Instead of just looking at a bunch of countries today and measuring their economic

00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:31.385
successes and cross-referencing that with the strength of their institutions,

00:05:31.925 --> 00:05:36.846
they believed it would be more revealing to look at how different countries

00:05:36.846 --> 00:05:41.676
developed economically after different institutional systems were implemented.

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.709
To do this, they used the example of countries that were

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:51.599
colonised in some shape or form, almost exclusively by Europeans.

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.287
This formed a “natural experiment”, which allowed them to examine

00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:03.047
how different colonisation strategies—such as extractive vs.

00:06:03.067 --> 00:06:06.687
inclusive institutions—impacted economic development.

00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:14.137
Being economists, they made no moral or ethical judgments; they simply looked at what the

00:06:14.137 --> 00:06:21.739
colonisers did from a practical point of view and measured the results in terms of economic output.

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.869
And what they found was, well, it was deemed worthy of a Nobel prize.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:37.419
They saw that the richest countries before colonisation were among the poorest post

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:45.439
colonisation, and that the poorest before colonisation were the richest post colonisation.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:54.089
In other words, colonisation made rich countries poor and poor countries rich.

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:01.969
One of the examples they gave was of a city called Nogales, on the U.S.-Mexico border.

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:08.419
It is one city, but split down the middle between two countries.

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.159
As with many towns and cities that are divided

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:17.029
between the US and Mexico, it is a tale of two cities.

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:22.349
As you might imagine, the American side is much richer.

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:28.089
Disposable incomes are higher, life expectancy is higher, houses are bigger,

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:33.429
schools are better, it is more economically developed than the Mexican side.

00:07:34.679 --> 00:07:40.459
The economists explain that the reason for this prosperity comes from the fact

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:45.639
that the residents of the American side of the city benefit from America’s

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:51.029
strong and inclusive institutions, its economy and its political system.

00:07:52.418 --> 00:07:59.425
It might seem obvious, on one level, but it is a useful example to demonstrate their theories.

00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:05.770
Other theories about the key drivers of economic prosperity, as we heard at the

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:11.285
start of the episode, tend to centre around geography or culture or history.

00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:14.925
But Nogales does not fit this model.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:20.305
The city residents on the American side and the Mexican side have the

00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:25.115
same geography and culture, most will speak the same language, watch

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:30.465
the same movies, eat the same food, and have the same shared culture.

00:08:31.475 --> 00:08:38.035
Yet the ones on the American side will live a much more economically prosperous life.

00:08:39.295 --> 00:08:44.535
A key reason for this, the economists put forward, is to do with institutions.

00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:51.295
For all of its faults, the US has strong property rights, strong rule

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:56.305
of law, a system that its citizens broadly trust to look out for them.

00:08:57.085 --> 00:09:02.195
They can take risks by starting businesses or taking on loans, they can invest in

00:09:02.195 --> 00:09:08.225
themselves and their families, they can do all of the things that create economic growth.

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:16.385
These institutions are inclusive; they exist for the benefit of the citizens.

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:22.465
On the Mexican side, however, the institutions are weaker.

00:09:23.725 --> 00:09:29.175
Citizens have less confidence in the fairness of the legal system, there is the

00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:34.225
problem of organised criminals, the rule of law and of institutions are weaker.

00:09:35.435 --> 00:09:41.015
To any wonderful people listening to this in Mexico, this, nor the words of the three

00:09:41.015 --> 00:09:46.875
economists are intended as any kind of judgement, but rather a presentation of facts.

00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:54.755
The result is that the US’s GDP per capita is almost six times that of Mexico.

00:09:55.995 --> 00:10:02.375
Or to put it another way, the average person in the USA creates almost

00:10:02.385 --> 00:10:07.745
six times more economic value than the average person in Mexico.

00:10:08.905 --> 00:10:12.745
But, and it is here that we get to the most interesting part of the

00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:18.315
research, if we were to go back 500 years, the reverse was true.

00:10:19.365 --> 00:10:23.445
The part of the world now called Mexico was much richer than

00:10:23.445 --> 00:10:26.435
the part of the world now called the United States of America.

00:10:27.385 --> 00:10:33.105
Both areas were colonised, but with dramatically different results.

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:40.395
And the economists showed that this North American example was no exception.

00:10:41.137 --> 00:10:46.987
Countries that were rich before colonisation tended to be poorer today.

00:10:48.065 --> 00:10:55.245
Countries that were poorer and less developed before colonisation tended to be richer today.

00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:58.515
Why, asked the economists?

00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:05.965
What is it about colonisation that makes rich countries poor and poor countries rich?

00:11:07.452 --> 00:11:10.862
What the economists proposed was as follows.

00:11:11.922 --> 00:11:17.562
In the case of formerly rich countries, they typically had high population densities;

00:11:17.864 --> 00:11:22.872
there were lots of people living there who could be exploited for financial gain.

00:11:24.212 --> 00:11:31.232
In some cases, they were already being exploited by a local elite, and in this case the

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:37.222
colonisers overpowered the local elite and took over existing institutions that had been

00:11:37.222 --> 00:11:42.182
designed for the purpose of extracting wealth and resources from the local population.

00:11:43.742 --> 00:11:50.370
And if these extractive institutions and systems didn’t already exist, the colonisers would

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:56.690
create systems and institutions based on the exploitation of the colonised population.

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:03.240
The entire colony would be set up so that a relatively small number of settlers

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:09.512
would be able to extract as much value as possible from the large local population.

00:12:10.602 --> 00:12:17.092
In the case of the formerly poor colonies, however, their situation was the opposite.

00:12:18.292 --> 00:12:23.712
They typically had lower population densities, meaning that there was more space to live

00:12:23.812 --> 00:12:29.097
and less threat of being attacked by the locals, which meant that more settlers moved there.

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:36.452
The systems and institutions that the colonisers set up there were not primarily based on the

00:12:36.492 --> 00:12:43.842
exploitation of the local people, but on the long-term prosperity of the new local colonisers.

00:12:44.472 --> 00:12:47.822
They were inclusive, not extractive.

00:12:49.272 --> 00:12:54.782
In the example of the United States versus Mexico, the part of the world we now call

00:12:54.792 --> 00:13:01.422
the US was very sparsely populated when the first Europeans arrived, and the settlers

00:13:01.632 --> 00:13:06.772
created institutions that benefitted the increasingly large settler population.

00:13:07.402 --> 00:13:13.012
While in Mexico, a relatively small number of Spanish settlers took over and

00:13:13.012 --> 00:13:18.392
created systems that focussed on the extraction of wealth, with no attention

00:13:18.392 --> 00:13:23.582
paid to creating long-term systems that would benefit the local population.

00:13:25.052 --> 00:13:29.052
Now, you don’t win a Nobel Prize for looking at a few historical

00:13:29.052 --> 00:13:32.832
examples and saying “ta-da, well that’s that proven then!”

00:13:33.452 --> 00:13:36.252
There was a vast amount of empirical data collected,

00:13:36.492 --> 00:13:39.762
which often hadn’t been previously analysed in detail.

00:13:40.552 --> 00:13:45.932
They looked at mortality rates of colonisers, they looked at economic prosperity in countries

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:51.642
that had never been colonised, they looked at periods before and after colonisation.

00:13:53.192 --> 00:13:58.332
The mortality rate data–the data on the proportion of settlers who

00:13:58.342 --> 00:14:03.422
died–was particularly interesting, although perhaps not so surprising.

00:14:04.822 --> 00:14:08.652
What they found was that colonies with high settler

00:14:08.652 --> 00:14:12.792
mortality rates tended to have worse economies today.

00:14:14.147 --> 00:14:19.445
And these two data points were not random, the economists proposed,

00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:23.995
the high mortality rates resulted in poorer economies today.

00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:25.835
Why?

00:14:26.295 --> 00:14:29.015
Well here’s what the economists suggested.

00:14:30.247 --> 00:14:36.537
In countries with high settler mortality rates, for example countries with high prevalence of

00:14:36.537 --> 00:14:43.467
tropical diseases, many settlers died, which in turn discouraged more settlers from moving there.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:51.027
As a result of both the settlers who did go dying in high numbers and those who would have gone

00:14:51.037 --> 00:14:56.557
being discouraged from going, there were fewer settlers, which meant that there was less of

00:14:56.557 --> 00:15:02.257
an incentive to create inclusive institutions and systems that benefited the local population.

00:15:03.692 --> 00:15:11.362
And, on the flip side, low mortality rates meant settlers were likely to stay, encouraging colonial

00:15:11.362 --> 00:15:17.782
powers to set up systems that supported long-term prosperity for a growing settler community.

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:27.320
If that all sounds theoretical, think about the examples of USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.780
These are all areas with comparatively few deadly diseases, they had large settler

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:40.510
populations, and now tend to have strong institutions and high-performing economies.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.990
And then contrast that with, well, almost any former colony close to

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.360
the Equator, whether that’s somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa or India.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:57.270
These are places with higher levels of tropical diseases, places which had higher levels of

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:04.160
settler mortality, and now tend to have weaker institutions and poorer-performing economies.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:10.670
This led to what the economists call a “reversal of fortune.”

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:17.020
Regions that were highly populated and wealthy before colonisation, like

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:22.420
parts of Latin America and India, became poorer over time, while sparsely

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.997
populated areas, like North America, saw significantly more economic prosperity.

00:16:29.134 --> 00:16:34.117
And in countries that were not colonised, there was no reversal of fortune;

00:16:34.757 --> 00:16:40.217
richer countries broadly stayed rich, and poorer countries broadly stayed poor.

00:16:41.117 --> 00:16:46.127
And as for the question of why countries with weaker institutions and rules of

00:16:46.127 --> 00:16:50.957
law don’t simply create them, if they are so key to economic development, the

00:16:50.957 --> 00:16:55.757
economists developed a series of complicated theories and frameworks, but to

00:16:55.757 --> 00:17:01.797
cut a long story short, the main issue, they argued, is one of self-interest.

00:17:02.797 --> 00:17:08.847
In a country with weak and extractive institutions, a local elite will typically hold all

00:17:08.847 --> 00:17:14.227
the power, and there simply isn’t a great enough incentive for them to implement reforms.

00:17:15.665 --> 00:17:21.285
Sometimes they are forced to, and this is where democracy is introduced

00:17:21.285 --> 00:17:27.315
and a country does turn a corner, but this is an exception, not the norm.

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:32.565
Now, as with anything in the field of economics, even

00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:36.065
this Nobel Prize winning work was not without its critics.

00:17:36.945 --> 00:17:42.175
It was labelled as confusing correlation with causation, with overrepresenting

00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:46.795
the importance of institutions, and of reducing colonialism to a

00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:51.545
question of economics, completely removing its human and cultural impact.

00:17:52.785 --> 00:17:55.705
There are also, as its critics were happy to point

00:17:55.785 --> 00:17:59.375
out, many examples that don’t support this theory.

00:18:00.575 --> 00:18:07.755
Countries like South Korea and Botswana were both victims of extractive colonisers, but they

00:18:07.765 --> 00:18:13.235
have managed impressive economic development that other often neighbouring countries have not.

00:18:14.355 --> 00:18:19.975
China also bucks the trend; it is not a democracy with personal freedoms enjoyed

00:18:19.975 --> 00:18:25.875
elsewhere, yet it has enjoyed spectacular economic growth over the past 40 years.

00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:29.255
So, what does this all mean?

00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:35.405
Well, the work of Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson has

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:39.505
certainly provided a new perspective to think about global prosperity.

00:18:40.145 --> 00:18:45.605
Their focus on institutions has reshaped how many economists think about development, and

00:18:45.765 --> 00:18:51.255
helped explain the crucial role institutions play in determining a country’s economic fate.

00:18:52.245 --> 00:18:57.829
As with any economic theory, as you heard, not everyone agrees with their conclusions.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:04.219
You might even be listening to this and thinking, hmm, that doesn’t sound quite right.

00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:09.909
Or perhaps you’ve been nodding your head, thinking, “ahh, well that explains it”.

00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:16.049
The fun or frustrating thing about economics is that it’s not a science, it's

00:19:16.069 --> 00:19:21.079
about looking at the world, and trying to make sense of it, two people can look

00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:25.159
at exactly the same thing and come to two completely different conclusions,

00:19:25.389 --> 00:19:30.584
but both be completely sure that they are right and the other one is wrong.

00:19:31.984 --> 00:19:34.254
There’s an old joke that you might have heard before.

00:19:34.994 --> 00:19:39.004
“If you put two economists in a room, you’ll get three opinions.”

00:19:39.854 --> 00:19:45.744
It’s a fun one, poking fun at a discipline that looks at the world and tries to overlay

00:19:45.744 --> 00:19:51.324
a theory to explain it, but where the same person might even disagree with themselves.

00:19:52.414 --> 00:19:57.204
These three economists certainly haven’t definitively answered the question of

00:19:57.204 --> 00:20:02.074
what makes one country rich and another poor, but they have certainly provided

00:20:02.104 --> 00:20:06.764
an interesting lens through which to think about this trillion dollar question.

00:20:09.264 --> 00:20:13.634
OK then, that is it for today's episode on colonial institutions,

00:20:13.814 --> 00:20:17.764
the nobel prize for economics, and what makes a country rich or poor.

00:20:18.414 --> 00:20:21.504
I hope it's been an interesting one, and that you've learnt something new.

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:25.464
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:25.814 --> 00:20:30.924
What do you think about the decision to award the Nobel Prize to these three economists?

00:20:31.158 --> 00:20:36.078
What do you think we can learn from their work, and how should it affect our decisions today?

00:20:36.675 --> 00:20:39.774
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:42.774

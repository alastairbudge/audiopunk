Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:15.268
Leonardo English - the show where you can listen to interesting stories and learn

00:00:15.418 --> 00:00:20.728
fascinating things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:27.503
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about bottled water.

00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:35.063
It is a fascinating story and takes us from the Romans to the Victorians, to the

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:43.433
modern day, and is a prime example of the power of marketing and advertising, of how

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:49.838
hundreds of millions of people pay large amounts of money for something that they

00:00:49.838 --> 00:00:57.668
can often get for free ,and how water throughout the ages has been a status symbol.

00:00:58.368 --> 00:01:04.028
I've wanted to do this episode for a while, so I'm thrilled to be sharing it with you today.

00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:09.638
So let's start, as we often do, with a bit of history.

00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:15.668
Of course, humans and animals have drunk water forever.

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:20.828
Up to 60% of our body is water, and we need it to survive.

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:30.086
And historically before the development of large cities and urban settlements, when

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:36.956
we would drink water, this water would come from rivers, streams, springs, or wells.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.790
As people started to live in ever larger communities, the danger of water not being

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.242
safe to drink increased, but there really wasn't any way to make the water itself safer.

00:01:52.722 --> 00:01:59.382
So in Europe at least, those who could afford to used to go to spa towns

00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:04.872
to take the water, places where there were natural spas and springs

00:02:05.232 --> 00:02:11.082
and people could go for a period of time for supposed health reasons.

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:20.362
The British town Bath, otherwise known as Bath Spa, is named so because of its

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:25.882
spa, where the Romans used to go and bathe and drink the refreshing waters.

00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:32.842
And because in towns and villages, the water wasn't safe to drink, instead

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:39.262
people would drink other safer drinks that had been processed in various ways.

00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:43.132
In Europe, things like beer and wine.

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:47.092
In China and parts of East Asia, tea.

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:55.732
But as the popularity of going to the spa continued to increase for people living in urban

00:02:55.732 --> 00:03:04.147
areas, there was the demand for some way of bringing spa water back to the cities and towns.

00:03:05.377 --> 00:03:09.577
And it's here that we first encounter bottled water.

00:03:11.197 --> 00:03:16.177
One of the first instances of bottled water was in the year

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:21.967
1621 at a place called Holy Well in the west of England.

00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:28.162
They bottled spa water, and distributed it throughout Britain.

00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:33.802
This water was fizzy water, it was effervescent.

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:41.212
People drank it for its supposed health benefits, but also because they liked the taste.

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:47.382
It was a tiny industry though - this was before the industrial

00:03:47.382 --> 00:03:53.352
revolution and there really wasn't any way of mass producing the stuff.

00:03:53.952 --> 00:03:58.992
It was a luxury that only the richest in society could afford.

00:04:00.912 --> 00:04:07.062
Over the next few hundred years, as innovation led to a reduction in the cost of

00:04:07.062 --> 00:04:13.297
producing water, and there was an increasing amount of health concerns about drinking

00:04:13.297 --> 00:04:20.287
water from public supplies, the bottled water industry continued to grow and grow.

00:04:21.337 --> 00:04:29.257
Bottles became cheaper and safer, and throughout Europe and North America sales grew every year.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:39.622
However, the success and growth of bottled water hit a bit of a roadblock, its growth slowed.

00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:46.155
The reason for this was that in the early 20th century, it was discovered

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:52.155
that adding chlorine to the water supply would kill a lot of bacteria and

00:04:52.485 --> 00:04:57.765
that this was a cheap and effective way of making the water safe to drink.

00:04:59.105 --> 00:05:03.275
Suddenly people realised that the water that came from

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:07.385
the municipal supplies was good, it was safe to drink.

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:14.495
And it was free, or if it wasn't completely free, it was very, very cheap.

00:05:15.905 --> 00:05:22.265
In North America, the sales of bottled water plummeted, they reduced drastically.

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:29.090
Understandably, people could get it for free, so why would they pay for it?

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.590
In Europe, bottled water remained a bit of a status symbol, something that was

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:43.070
sold in cafes and restaurants, especially on the continent, in continental Europe.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.817
In the late 20th century, though, everything changed again for bottled water.

00:05:51.227 --> 00:05:59.174
There was a very famous marketing campaign in 1977, by Perrier, the French fizzy water company.

00:06:00.914 --> 00:06:05.794
It was  by the actor and filmmaker Orson Welles.

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:10.264
I'm actually going to play it here, it's only 30 seconds.

00:06:11.134 --> 00:06:18.064
So here we go, listen to the advert that changed the fate of bottled water forever.

00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:25.054
Deep below the Plains of Southern France, in a mysterious process, begun millions of

00:06:25.054 --> 00:06:31.724
years ago, nature herself adds life to the icy waters of a single spring, Perrier.

00:06:32.434 --> 00:06:36.694
Its natural sparkle is more delicate than any made by man and therefore

00:06:36.694 --> 00:06:40.354
more quenching, more refreshing, and the mixer par excellence.

00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:47.434
Naturally sparkling, from the center of the earth, Perrier.

00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:50.001
So there we go.

00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:56.751
If you didn't get everything there, he is describing how this amazing water

00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:02.871
comes from deep under Southern France and how it is made by nature herself.

00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:10.611
This advert positioned this water as the ultimate status symbol.

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:16.581
It was expensive, at today's equivalent of around $3 a bottle.

00:07:17.016 --> 00:07:25.416
But not so expensive that it was completely out of reach to America's aspiring middle class.

00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:30.696
This coincided with a shift in North America and Europe

00:07:31.056 --> 00:07:34.776
away from drinking strong alcohol during the day.

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:39.546
Previously, it had been socially acceptable to drink

00:07:39.746 --> 00:07:44.526
whisky and brandy and all sorts of spirits at the office.

00:07:44.871 --> 00:07:48.171
But this was becoming less and less acceptable.

00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:54.591
If you've watched the series Mad Men, you will, of course know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:59.991
Drinking something like Perrier, or if I'm an American,

00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:03.561
I should say Perrier, showed that you were serious.

00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:09.531
It showed you cared about your health and it showed that you were an aspirational person.

00:08:11.161 --> 00:08:17.281
But it wasn't really about what was inside the bottle, but it was the bottle itself.

00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:21.471
The bottle showed what you wanted to be.

00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:24.831
Sales skyrocketed.

00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:33.561
It went from selling 3 million bottles in 1975 to 200 million just four years later.

00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:36.611
Americans were loving it.

00:08:38.056 --> 00:08:41.146
But remember, this was still fizzy water.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:47.836
This idea of buying bottled plain water, when you could get

00:08:47.896 --> 00:08:53.026
the same normal water out of the tap was still quite strange.

00:08:54.586 --> 00:09:01.126
As companies saw the growing popularity of fizzy water and saw how

00:09:01.156 --> 00:09:06.586
they could persuade consumers to do almost anything through large

00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:12.526
advertising campaigns, they came for plain water, they came for tap water.

00:09:14.066 --> 00:09:20.396
In the early 200s there was a series of campaigns that preyed on people's

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:25.676
fears, they capitalised on the fears that people had about tap water.

00:09:26.856 --> 00:09:30.246
They tried to get people to be afraid of drinking

00:09:30.246 --> 00:09:34.476
water from the tap, and instead to buy bottled water.

00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:41.736
There were famous advertising campaigns with taglines like "tap and

00:09:41.736 --> 00:09:46.056
toilet water come from the same source, don't you deserve better?"

00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:53.661
And sales of normal flat, bottled water, they really started to take off.

00:09:54.861 --> 00:10:01.671
Despite the fact that in most of North America and large parts of Europe water from

00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:08.271
the tap is just as safe as bottled water, people were understandably concerned when

00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:13.071
someone made them think about their toilet and drinking water in the same sentence.

00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:18.946
And as there has been increasing levels of concern about the dangers

00:10:18.976 --> 00:10:24.976
of drinking lots of sugary drinks, of soda, Coke, and so on, bottled

00:10:24.976 --> 00:10:30.586
water has continued its ascent, it has continued to rise in popularity.

00:10:31.976 --> 00:10:37.698
Bottled water is now the most popular drink in North America, and this is in

00:10:37.698 --> 00:10:43.068
a country where you can get the same thing from the tap practically for free.

00:10:44.298 --> 00:10:47.418
Of course it's not just in North America and Europe.

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:54.948
The US is actually the second largest consumer market for bottled water after China.

00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:59.983
But in China, there is a perfectly good reason to drink

00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:03.373
bottled water, at least from a consumer point of view.

00:11:04.153 --> 00:11:09.913
And that is that the water that you get from the taps in China just isn't safe.

00:11:11.803 --> 00:11:18.073
Even in Shanghai, which if you've been there you'll know is a huge futuristic

00:11:18.103 --> 00:11:26.698
metropolis, 85% of the water in its major rivers was considered undrinkable, and

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:34.438
56% of it was considered unfit for any purpose, so they can't use it for anything.

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:42.718
In Beijing, 40% of all water sources are so polluted that they basically

00:11:42.748 --> 00:11:49.018
just can't be used, and in Tianjin, a huge port city in the North of

00:11:49.018 --> 00:11:55.768
China, less than 5% of the water can be used as a source of drinking water.

00:11:57.748 --> 00:12:02.098
So of course, in lots of countries, drinking water from the

00:12:02.098 --> 00:12:06.388
tap just isn't an option - you have to drink bottled water.

00:12:07.528 --> 00:12:14.848
But coming back to bottled water in places where there is perfectly good tap water, it is

00:12:14.848 --> 00:12:21.748
a really interesting phenomenon, that people pay to get something that they can get almost

00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:28.198
for free, that also has the advantage of having a significantly lower environmental impact.

00:12:30.138 --> 00:12:37.457
A study from the WWF, the world wildlife fund, found that more than 50% of the

00:12:37.457 --> 00:12:45.767
US population drinks bottled water and people spend from 240 to over 10,000

00:12:45.767 --> 00:12:52.097
times more per gallon for bottled water than they typically do for tap water.

00:12:53.422 --> 00:13:01.672
So it can cost 10,000 times more to buy pretty much exactly the same thing, but

00:13:01.762 --> 00:13:08.482
Americans still spend around $16 billion on bottled water every single year.

00:13:09.982 --> 00:13:17.242
This study said that if you drink eight glasses of water per day, a year's supply of normal bottled

00:13:17.242 --> 00:13:26.852
water would cost approximately $200, and the same amount of tap water would cost about 33 cents.

00:13:27.512 --> 00:13:32.132
To repeat, that is $200 versus 33 cents.

00:13:33.502 --> 00:13:38.302
Now most of us are conditioned to think that bottled water is

00:13:38.302 --> 00:13:44.552
better - it's healthier, safer and tastier than what comes out of a tap.

00:13:45.602 --> 00:13:50.612
Of course it must be - you pay for it, therefore it must be better, right?

00:13:51.512 --> 00:13:53.732
In some cases, this is true.

00:13:54.032 --> 00:13:59.222
Some places have water that has more chemicals in it, or has a strange taste.

00:13:59.777 --> 00:14:06.557
But in the vast majority of cases in North America and in Europe, at least,

00:14:06.767 --> 00:14:11.597
there is very little evidence to suggest that there is any difference.

00:14:12.497 --> 00:14:16.997
There have been lots of experiments where people are given different types

00:14:16.997 --> 00:14:23.177
of water - some very expensive water from bottles and some water just from

00:14:23.177 --> 00:14:27.587
the tap, from the main supplies, the same water that goes into your toilet.

00:14:28.292 --> 00:14:32.672
And not only can most people not tell the difference,

00:14:32.822 --> 00:14:36.812
but from a health perspective, there is no difference.

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:45.332
In many cases, the bottled water that has the lovely logo, the lovely name and that you

00:14:45.332 --> 00:14:52.712
might think has been lovingly put into a bottle at the top of a glacier is actually just

00:14:52.712 --> 00:14:59.402
the same water as the water that comes from the tap, but has been slightly treated by a

00:14:59.402 --> 00:15:06.632
company, put in a bottle and then sold for up to 10,000 times more than they bought it for.

00:15:08.132 --> 00:15:11.132
Not everyone is falling for this trick though.

00:15:11.612 --> 00:15:16.562
When Coca Cola tried to launch their own brand of bottled water in the

00:15:16.562 --> 00:15:22.652
UK called Dasani, it was a complete flop, it was a complete disaster.

00:15:23.732 --> 00:15:31.517
They used the same approach, the same formula as had worked in the United States, which

00:15:31.517 --> 00:15:37.637
was just add some minerals to tap water and put it in a bottle with a large price tag.

00:15:38.777 --> 00:15:44.657
What they hadn't realised is that there is a famous scene in a British

00:15:44.687 --> 00:15:50.327
comedy series called Only Fools and Horses where one of the main

00:15:50.327 --> 00:15:56.087
characters tries to sell water from the tap in a bottle for a huge profit.

00:15:57.877 --> 00:16:03.457
When it was revealed that the water that Coca-Cola was selling for around a dollar

00:16:03.457 --> 00:16:09.937
a bottle was just slightly treated tap water, there was a huge uproar in the

00:16:09.937 --> 00:16:15.727
British press, in the British newspapers, and a lot of comparisons made between

00:16:15.757 --> 00:16:22.237
Coca-Cola and this character from Only Fools and Horses, this famous British comedy.

00:16:23.617 --> 00:16:29.707
Just three months after launching Dasani was removed from sale in Great Britain

00:16:31.077 --> 00:16:36.837
and Coca Cola didn't return to the British bottled water market for 10 years.

00:16:38.337 --> 00:16:42.777
Even though this might all be an interesting idea to think about

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:47.037
theoretically, it obviously has an environmental cost as well.

00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:53.662
The world will produce over half a trillion plastic bottles next year.

00:16:54.442 --> 00:17:00.772
Fewer than half of the bottles bought are ever even collected for recycling, and

00:17:00.802 --> 00:17:07.282
only 7% of the bottles that are collected for recycling are turned into new bottles.

00:17:08.122 --> 00:17:16.462
Most of them have a life of about an hour or so when they are opened drunk, and then they

00:17:16.462 --> 00:17:22.702
end up in the rubbish dump or in the ocean, as we talked about on another recent episode.

00:17:24.562 --> 00:17:30.262
And unlike most other plastic waste, whether that's shampoo, toothpaste

00:17:30.292 --> 00:17:35.677
or food packaging, for many people there is an alternative to bottled

00:17:35.677 --> 00:17:40.477
water that is right in front of us and significantly less expensive.

00:17:41.607 --> 00:17:45.667
Yet hundreds of millions of people choose not to use it.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:52.807
What I do think is a really interesting idea though, and it's what we will

00:17:52.807 --> 00:17:59.947
end with today is how water has been a status symbol for hundreds of years.

00:18:01.087 --> 00:18:06.067
It's something that everyone on the planet needs to drink, and therefore

00:18:06.217 --> 00:18:10.961
the kind of water we drink is to a certain extent, a way of showing

00:18:10.961 --> 00:18:14.971
your identity, of showing how you're different from other people.

00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:22.831
Hundreds of years ago, it might have been a visit to a spa town to show that you care about your

00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:31.361
health, but also just showing yourself there, drinking this water - you wanted to be seen at a spa

00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:37.261
town, as it said something about who you were and the kinds of people that you socialised with.

00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:45.511
Then 40 years ago, it was drinking a chilled glass of Perrier with a slice of

00:18:45.511 --> 00:18:50.501
lemon to show that you meant business - you weren't going to be drinking whisky

00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:55.141
at lunch, you drunk Perrier because you were an important business person.

00:18:56.841 --> 00:19:02.948
And now in 2020, it might be drinking fancy flavoured water to

00:19:02.948 --> 00:19:06.638
show that you are healthy and you care about your wellbeing.

00:19:07.528 --> 00:19:13.774
Or it might be just drinking normal, bottled water because you can afford it, and perhaps

00:19:13.774 --> 00:19:18.454
you just want to show that you can't afford to take risks with water from the tap.

00:19:19.514 --> 00:19:22.724
The reasons might change, but we still drink certain

00:19:22.724 --> 00:19:27.254
types of water often because we want to show who we are.

00:19:28.453 --> 00:19:34.339
Of course, for the billions of people all over the world who don't have access to clean

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:42.199
drinking water from taps, bottled water is an amazing invention and necessity for daily life.

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:46.729
It's not going to give you cholera or be filled with disease,

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:52.039
it is cheap and convenient, and that is a fantastic thing.

00:19:53.269 --> 00:20:01.849
But for those of us who do have access to healthy, clean drinking water from our taps available at

00:20:01.849 --> 00:20:09.814
a very small cost, I think if you went back to someone 50 years ago, before that famous advert had

00:20:09.814 --> 00:20:17.914
come out and explained that now we are all buying bottled water, that is really not so different to

00:20:17.914 --> 00:20:24.394
the stuff that we get out of our taps, well, I think they would probably find that quite surprising.

00:20:27.169 --> 00:20:30.379
Okay then, that is it for bottled water.

00:20:30.739 --> 00:20:36.019
It is a really interesting idea, and with my marketing hat on, it

00:20:36.019 --> 00:20:40.399
does sort of show that we can be persuaded to do almost anything.

00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:44.869
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:48.079
I know we have members from some countries where the

00:20:48.079 --> 00:20:51.019
water from the tap is delicious and completely fine.

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:56.569
I know we have members from countries where the water from the tap is not so good.

00:20:57.199 --> 00:21:02.389
And I also know that we have members from countries where drinking water from the

00:21:02.389 --> 00:21:08.419
tap or asking for tap water is not really a culturally acceptable thing to do.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:15.939
So I would love to know what you think, as always you can email hi hi@leonardoenglish.com.

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:22.269

Hello, hello, hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:11.927
English.

00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:17.402
The show where you can improve your English while learning fascinating things about the world.

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:24.812
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the most famous English dictionary

00:00:24.932 --> 00:00:26.552
that has ever been written.

00:00:27.872 --> 00:00:34.982
It wasn't the first and it wasn't the last, but it is probably the most important and has gone down

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:39.362
in history as the most amazing work of scholarship.

00:00:40.592 --> 00:00:40.952
Yes.

00:00:41.072 --> 00:00:47.252
I know it's about a dictionary, and this might not sound like the most interesting of subjects, but

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:54.542
I promise you that the story is pretty intriguing and ends up being quite funny, certainly funnier

00:00:54.572 --> 00:00:57.812
than you think that a podcast about a dictionary would be.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:05.132
Some of the definitions of words are, well, they're not very politically correct as we'll find out.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:13.097
Before we get right into the podcast though, let me just give you your customary reminder for those

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:19.517
of you listening to the podcast on iVoox Spotify, Google Podcasts, or wherever you get your

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:25.367
podcasts, that you can find a copy of the transcript and key vocabulary for this podcast over on the

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:27.997
website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:35.927
The transcript is super helpful for following along with the podcast, and the key vocabulary helps

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:41.927
explain difficult words so that you can build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening.

00:01:42.707 --> 00:01:44.627
So it's definitely worth a look.

00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:47.707
You can find out more at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:49.907 --> 00:01:52.967
Okay then let's talk about this dictionary.

00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:00.517
It was published in the year 1755, over 250 years ago.

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:08.672
It took eight years to complete and is a work of extraordinary scholarship.

00:02:10.052 --> 00:02:18.722
It's author was a man called Samuel Johnson, who was paid the equivalent today of about 250,000

00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.852
pounds to write the dictionary.

00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:24.472
It wasn't the first dictionary.

00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:32.782
Dictionaries had been written before, and there were some attempts in the late 16th century to

00:02:32.782 --> 00:02:34.312
create English dictionaries.

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:44.392
But Johnson's dictionary, this dictionary has gone down in history as the first real authoritative

00:02:44.662 --> 00:02:45.172
dictionary.

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:53.827
The first one that actually captured the English that was used by the masses, the kind of English

00:02:54.007 --> 00:03:00.607
that you would find spoken if you walked down the streets of London, Liverpool, or Bristol.

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:09.077
Before we talk about the dictionary itself, I think it's worth just painting a picture of the kind

00:03:09.077 --> 00:03:16.712
of world, from a linguistic point of view, that existed at the time that this dictionary was

00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:17.072
written.

00:03:17.912 --> 00:03:22.892
And also it's worth reflecting on why people might want a dictionary.

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:31.072
What was the actual purpose of a dictionary and why was Johnson paid to write one?

00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:41.721
Well, the Early Modern period of British history, so that's the period between 1500 and 1650, this

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:47.601
was a period in which they were a huge number of new words added to the English language.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:55.514
It's estimated that the number of words in use doubled in that 150-year period.

00:03:57.164 --> 00:04:03.344
Some of these new words were added to English after being borrowed from Latin or Greek.

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.419
And others were just added from other languages, from other countries.

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:19.399
English as a language was a bit of a mess and there wasn't one central record of what all of these

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.869
words actually meant.

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:29.119
At the same time, people were starting to move from the countryside to the cities.

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:36.394
Literacy rates were starting to rise - that's the number of people who could read and write, and

00:04:36.604 --> 00:04:41.524
there was much more of a focus on the education of children.

00:04:42.244 --> 00:04:45.784
Unfortunately, at that time, that just meant the education of boys.

00:04:47.134 --> 00:04:55.069
So if you add all of these factors together, a large increase in the number of words in use, plus

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:02.479
more people able to read and write, then you could say that it seemed clear that there was a need

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:10.729
for some kind of formal record of what all of these words actually meant, a record of the language.

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:20.269
Without a record, words would mean different things to different people in different places, and

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:27.229
there was the risk of different parts of the country all ending up speaking completely different

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:27.889
languages.

00:05:28.993 --> 00:05:37.161
There were a few attempts to create this all-encompassing dictionary, this attempt to collate all of

00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:47.401
the words and their definitions, but for a few hundred years, the efforts, the attempts made were

00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:49.921
overall unsatisfactory.

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:51.331
They didn't do a very good job.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:06:03.146
So fast-forward a century or so, we get to the early 18th century and the scene was set for Samuel

00:06:03.146 --> 00:06:05.745
Johnson, the hero of our story.

00:06:07.495 --> 00:06:17.225
When Johnson started out on his task, he saw his role as to provide order, and to help stabilise the

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:19.565
rules surrounding the English language.

00:06:20.515 --> 00:06:22.785
He thought it had got too messy.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:32.295
There were too many anomalies, too many peculiarities, too many strange rules, and he saw it as his

00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:40.845
task, his role, to set things straight, to document the English language as it should be documented.

00:06:41.962 --> 00:06:49.381
I'm sure you might be thinking, "hang on, even now it is full of anomalies and exceptions, if he

00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:51.481
improved it, what was it like before?"

00:06:53.311 --> 00:07:00.781
Well, after eight years of scholarship, Johnson realised that the English language was actually too

00:07:00.781 --> 00:07:06.331
complicated and convoluted, too messy, for him to fix.

00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:13.891
And he sort of gave up on his original task, his original mission of fixing English.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:22.646
The fact that language is a living organism, something that constantly changes, meant that he

00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:28.826
decided that his role was just to record the language of the day.

00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:31.721
Not to actually fix anything.

00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:39.586
And so he did record the language of the day, and he did so with incredible accuracy.

00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:45.046
In his dictionary there were 40,000 words.

00:07:46.336 --> 00:07:53.806
Each word was defined in detail, and the definitions had quotations and examples.

00:07:55.846 --> 00:08:02.716
When you think of the work that must have been required to achieve this, it's pretty amazing.

00:08:03.886 --> 00:08:11.566
This was obviously in a world before computers, the internet, Google, before information was so easy

00:08:11.566 --> 00:08:12.436
to access.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.522
So it was a huge, gargantuan task.

00:08:16.882 --> 00:08:22.372
No wonder it took him eight years to complete with the help of six assistants.

00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:31.677
Not only was it a hugely impressive piece of work, but lots of it was also pretty funny, and you can

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:37.827
see his sense of humour coming out in the definitions of some of the words.

00:08:38.277 --> 00:08:41.967
He's sort of hidden funny jokes in some of the definitions.

00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:47.067
So for example, the definition of oats.

00:08:48.207 --> 00:08:54.957
Now, if you don't know what oats are, the actual definition that you'd find today is something like

00:08:55.377 --> 00:09:02.517
"a plant that is a type of grass or as a grain used in baking and cooking or to feed animals".

00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:06.387
So it's used for cereals, but also for animals.

00:09:07.957 --> 00:09:16.657
In Johnson's dictionary, he defined oats as "a grain, which in England is generally given to horses,

00:09:17.107 --> 00:09:19.447
but in Scotland supports the people".

00:09:20.853 --> 00:09:26.178
As you may know, there was a lot of rivalry between England and Scotland at the time.

00:09:26.898 --> 00:09:34.128
Well, there is still to this day, and he was saying there that oats are something that people in

00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:39.078
England give to their horses, but in Scotland are eaten by the people.

00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:43.698
So basically comparing English horses with Scottish people.

00:09:44.658 --> 00:09:50.818
Yes, a little bit racist, you could say, but this was probably actually a joke for his assistants,

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:52.998
five of whom were Scottish.

00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:57.529
Secondly, he makes fun of himself.

00:09:58.669 --> 00:10:06.619
The technical term, the actual word, for the job that Johnson did was a lexicographer.

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:11.419
So lexicographer is the name for someone who writes dictionaries.

00:10:12.934 --> 00:10:21.004
But in Johnson's dictionary, when he had to write the definition of lexicographer, he wrote "a

00:10:21.004 --> 00:10:28.834
writer of dictionaries, a harmless drudge that busies himself in tracing the original and detailing

00:10:28.954 --> 00:10:30.814
the signification of words".

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:35.805
Now, you may not know what drudge means.

00:10:36.349 --> 00:10:43.398
It's defined as a person who has to work hard at boring and unpleasant tasks and who is not

00:10:43.398 --> 00:10:44.838
respected by other people.

00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:52.188
So basically he's saying that his job is to work on boring tasks and to be unappreciated.

00:10:54.158 --> 00:11:02.307
And finally, and I particularly like this one, he gave the definition of lunch as as much food as

00:11:02.307 --> 00:11:03.747
one's hand can hold".

00:11:04.993 --> 00:11:08.944
Obviously lunches with Samuel Johnson would have been pretty extensive.

00:11:09.813 --> 00:11:16.653
It's quite fun to think that he buried these little jokes in this work of what is otherwise

00:11:16.952 --> 00:11:18.782
incredibly impressive scholarship.

00:11:20.352 --> 00:11:27.492
I have developed even more respect for Johnson after now four months or so of creating definitions

00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:31.182
for all of the key vocabulary in the podcasts for you.

00:11:32.512 --> 00:11:38.782
If you haven't seen this already, all of the more difficult words are highlighted and we provide

00:11:38.782 --> 00:11:43.342
definitions for everyone so that the podcast is easier to understand.

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:52.217
There are so many words in English with multiple different definitions and providing a meaning that

00:11:52.217 --> 00:11:59.987
is clear and easy to understand and correct for the context of the word is often quite hard.

00:12:01.104 --> 00:12:07.750
And today, at least, we have the advantage of the internet, of being able to consult multiple

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:15.430
dictionaries and see examples in order to either choose the best one or adapt it slightly to fit the

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.000
purpose.

00:12:17.016 --> 00:12:20.672
Johnson was starting completely from scratch, from nothing.

00:12:21.302 --> 00:12:28.442
And to think that this one person, or I should say one person and small team, to think that they

00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:34.382
were responsible for documenting 40,000 words, it's pretty impressive.

00:12:36.162 --> 00:12:44.142
So even though being a lexicographer is, as Johnson may say, a harmless drudge, it's certainly one

00:12:44.142 --> 00:12:46.152
that deserves a lot of respect.

00:12:48.482 --> 00:12:53.884
Okay then I hope that this has been an interesting look into this pretty amazing dictionary.

00:12:54.519 --> 00:13:01.449
Of course, the English language is constantly evolving, as is almost every language, and there are

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:07.119
hundreds of new words added every year, and a lexicographer's work is never done.

00:13:08.469 --> 00:13:11.709
As always, I'd love to know what you thought that the show.

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:14.949
Had you heard of the story of Johnson before?

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:21.669
Are there similar kinds of stories of famous lexicographers, famous dictionary writers, in your

00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:22.089
country?

00:13:22.689 --> 00:13:23.409
I'd love to know.

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:24.699
You can email in.

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:27.839
That's, hi hi@leonardoenglish.com.

00:13:28.329 --> 00:13:32.649
I read and respond to every single one and love hearing from you.

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:37.089
Okay then that is it for today's episode.

00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:39.669
I hope that you're staying safe wherever you are.

00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:45.009
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:49.569
I'm Alastair Budge and I will catch you in the next episode.

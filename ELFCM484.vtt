Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:16.134
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:19.994
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:26.854
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about a Scottish man called Robert Fortune.

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:34.174
He was a botanist, an expert in plants, but he has gone down in the record books for having pulled

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:41.994
off what has been called the greatest corporate espionage in history: the theft of tea from China.

00:00:42.794 --> 00:00:47.724
His is an amazing story that brings together colonialism, international

00:00:47.724 --> 00:00:53.634
trade, economics, drugs, addiction, botany, pirates and, of course, tea.

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:57.434
OK then, Robert Fortune.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:03.244
It is something of a stereotype that British people love drinking tea.

00:01:04.274 --> 00:01:07.824
Like most stereotypes, there is some truth behind it.

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:13.924
Brits drink a reported 100 million cups of tea every single day.

00:01:14.584 --> 00:01:20.924
In terms of the amount of tea consumed per capita, per person, Brits are the

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:26.244
third biggest consumers of tea in the world, behind only Ireland and Turkey.

00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:31.894
And this has been going on for almost 400 years.

00:01:32.814 --> 00:01:38.214
As you may know, or you might remember from episode number 238, in which we did a

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:44.304
deep dive into the history of tea, tea was first brought to Britain in the 1650s.

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:50.314
It was expensive, and was initially something that only the upper classes could afford.

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:57.484
Fast forward 150 years or so, and it was something that practically every

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:02.084
Brit could afford to drink on a daily basis, multiple times a day even.

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:07.944
It was safer to drink than water, because it was boiled, it was

00:02:07.954 --> 00:02:12.494
nice and warm, which comes in handy on a cold, damp British winter

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:17.264
morning, it gave you a nice little caffeine boost, and it tasted good.

00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:22.524
Well, it was tea, people enjoyed drinking it then for the

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:27.024
same reasons that I and perhaps you enjoy a cup today.

00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:33.824
By the start of the 19th century, tens of millions of Brits

00:02:34.054 --> 00:02:37.764
were hooked to their morning tea, but there was a problem.

00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:45.224
Their dealer, the source of the tea, was right over on the other side of the world: china.

00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:51.264
Practically all the tea in the world at this time came from China, and the

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:57.014
Chinese were not prepared to let anyone else in on the secret of how you make tea.

00:02:58.024 --> 00:03:02.504
I mean, Brits made tea by adding boiling water to the leaves, and then adding

00:03:02.504 --> 00:03:07.204
milk and sugar, they knew how to “make” tea once they had the tea leaves.

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:12.684
But as to where these leaves came from, and how they were prepared

00:03:13.014 --> 00:03:17.894
so that they could be used for tea, well that was a mystery.

00:03:18.894 --> 00:03:24.214
It was an important mystery to solve for greater reasons than simply curiosity.

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:30.994
Firstly, there was the question of how Britain could continue to pay for its tea habit.

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:36.254
The Chinese needed to be paid for their tea, so Britain

00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:40.224
needed a product it could sell China in exchange for tea.

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:45.274
The problem was that there wasn’t really anything China wanted.

00:03:45.644 --> 00:03:49.094
It didn’t want British textiles or manufactured goods.

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:57.634
To quote the Chinese emperor in a 1793 letter to King George of Britain, “our Celestial Empire

00:03:57.884 --> 00:04:03.534
possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its own borders”.

00:04:04.694 --> 00:04:07.934
In other words, “we have everything we need”.

00:04:09.234 --> 00:04:13.854
But there was one product that the British found they could sell into China.

00:04:14.364 --> 00:04:18.914
A product that the Chinese emperor might not have wanted for his people,

00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:25.444
but that the Chinese people were more than willing to buy: the drug opium.

00:04:26.674 --> 00:04:30.274
So, the trade went like this: Britain grew opium

00:04:30.654 --> 00:04:37.144
in India, shipped it to southern China, sold it to Chinese merchants in exchange

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:42.464
for silver, bought tea with silver, then shipped the tea back to Britain.

00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:48.734
Fast forward again to 1839, and China has had enough.

00:04:49.234 --> 00:04:54.834
Millions of Chinese are hooked on opium, and it is destroying the country.

00:04:56.094 --> 00:05:03.424
A Chinese governor in the south of China threw a massive amount of opium into the sea, sparking

00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:09.404
off the Opium Wars, which resulted in Britain winning the rights to trade in five treaty ports.

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:16.154
We have another entire episode on the Opium Wars, that’s episode number 93, so if you’d

00:05:16.154 --> 00:05:20.574
like to explore this in more detail, I’d recommend checking that one out afterwards.

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:24.864
But in the interests of today’s story, we must move on.

00:05:26.074 --> 00:05:33.494
By 1842 the first Opium War was over, China was licking its wounds, thoroughly

00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:39.724
defeated, and was forced to concede access to foreigners in five port cities.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:44.264
Britain continued to send opium into the country,

00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:48.264
and the number of Chinese addicts continued to grow.

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:54.594
The tea trade continued, but it was now on shaky ground.

00:05:55.144 --> 00:05:59.364
Relations between Britain and China were not amicable, they

00:05:59.364 --> 00:06:03.794
were practical, based only on mutually beneficial trade.

00:06:04.754 --> 00:06:08.484
British opium went in, Chinese tea came out.

00:06:09.294 --> 00:06:13.314
And these trade relations were hanging on a thread.

00:06:14.214 --> 00:06:18.514
What would happen if China legalised the production and consumption of opium?

00:06:18.874 --> 00:06:21.434
There would be no reason for it to continue trading

00:06:21.434 --> 00:06:25.234
with Britain, and the supply of tea would be cut off.

00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:31.344
This was a big concern, and it wasn’t only because tea was so tasty.

00:06:32.514 --> 00:06:35.314
To quote a letter from the governor-general of India,

00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:40.684
" “  It is in my opinion by no means improbable that in a few years the Government

00:06:40.684 --> 00:06:45.914
of Peking, by legalising the cultivation of Opium in China, where the soil has

00:06:45.914 --> 00:06:50.124
been already proved equally well adapted with India to the growth of the plant,

00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:54.964
may deprive this Government of one of its present chief sources of revenue

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.554
The clue to his primary concern is in the last part of the sentence.

00:07:01.054 --> 00:07:06.324
“may deprive this Government of one of its present chief sources of revenue”.

00:07:07.144 --> 00:07:10.474
See, tea was big business.

00:07:11.134 --> 00:07:18.524
Taxes on tea brought in an estimated 10% of the British government’s tax revenue.

00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:25.574
As a proportion of total government revenue, this is equivalent to corporation tax today.

00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:31.364
In other words, the proportion of the government’s income that came from taxes

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:36.794
on tea in the mid 19th century was the same as the proportion of the government’s

00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:42.114
income that comes from the profits of every single British business today.

00:07:43.454 --> 00:07:49.424
Clearly, protecting the tea trade was of great national importance, and it

00:07:49.424 --> 00:07:54.754
was of strategic concern that the secret to this entire trade, the secret

00:07:54.754 --> 00:08:00.414
of how to cultivate tea, was kept hidden deep inside a wounded enemy: China.

00:08:01.794 --> 00:08:05.754
And China at this time was a secret, mysterious place.

00:08:06.264 --> 00:08:11.604
Foreigners were not allowed to freely travel inland, all trade and all

00:08:11.614 --> 00:08:17.264
knowledge of what lay inland came through merchants in the five port

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:23.754
cities: if you're wondering, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Ningbo and Shanghai.

00:08:25.154 --> 00:08:29.967
So, access to China was contained to these five port cities,

00:08:29.974 --> 00:08:33.254
and foreigners were not legally allowed to travel inland.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:37.114
But not all foreigners heeded this law.

00:08:37.734 --> 00:08:43.184
And it’s here that we need to meet the hero–or villain–of today’s story.

00:08:43.834 --> 00:08:50.504
His name was Robert Fortune, and he was a botanist by trade, an expert in plants.

00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:55.644
He was born in 1812, and as a young man had developed

00:08:55.674 --> 00:09:00.014
something of a name for himself as an expert horticulturist.

00:09:00.994 --> 00:09:06.624
He did not grow up in a wealthy family, he had no titles or fortune to his

00:09:06.624 --> 00:09:12.554
name, so like other entrepreneurial or adventurous Victorian young men,

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:18.194
he decided that his name and fortune would be made through exploration.

00:09:19.354 --> 00:09:25.044
In 1842, after the end of the first Opium War, Fortune was commissioned

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:29.314
by the Royal Horticultural Society of London to go on a trip to

00:09:29.314 --> 00:09:33.734
China and examine and collect as many plant samples as he could.

00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:39.024
It took three years, And he returned with a huge collection

00:09:39.214 --> 00:09:43.094
of wonderful samples of trees, plants and bushes.

00:09:43.844 --> 00:09:51.104
He also had a huge adventure, and–like any Victorian worth their salt–wrote and

00:09:51.104 --> 00:09:56.404
published an account of his trip, which detailed battles with pirates, encounters

00:09:56.404 --> 00:10:01.764
with opium addicts, huge storms, almost dying on multiple occasions, as well

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:06.594
as plenty of plant references to satisfy armchair botanists back in Britain.

00:10:07.824 --> 00:10:13.554
Importantly for our story, he had also discovered that black and green

00:10:13.554 --> 00:10:18.514
tea do not come from two different types of tea plants; they come

00:10:18.544 --> 00:10:22.964
from the same tea leaf, they are simply treated in a different way.

00:10:24.574 --> 00:10:30.104
This made a name for him, and it also brought him to the attention of the

00:10:30.104 --> 00:10:34.934
most powerful company in the world at that time, some might argue the most

00:10:34.944 --> 00:10:39.684
powerful company that the world has ever seen: The East India Company.

00:10:41.114 --> 00:10:48.004
As you may know, or remember from episode number 279, The East India Company was this huge,

00:10:48.104 --> 00:10:53.974
sprawling private company that was given monopolies on trade in Asia by the British government.

00:10:55.114 --> 00:11:00.154
In 1848, a year after the publication of the account of his first trip to

00:11:00.154 --> 00:11:06.084
China, the East India Company made Robert Fortune an offer he could not refuse.

00:11:06.964 --> 00:11:13.644
They offered to pay him five times his annual salary to go to China, not only to learn

00:11:13.644 --> 00:11:19.714
the secret of how tea was made but to come back with tea plants and tea making experts,

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:25.864
so that the East india Company could start the production of Chinese tea in India.

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:31.474
They also threw in an extra little bonus, which was that he could keep

00:11:31.484 --> 00:11:35.254
the commercial rights to any other plants that he discovered on his trip.

00:11:36.224 --> 00:11:39.254
The East India Company was interested in one thing

00:11:39.454 --> 00:11:43.464
and one thing only: the secret of how to make tea.

00:11:44.884 --> 00:11:48.844
Fortune jumped at the offer, and set off for China.

00:11:49.634 --> 00:11:55.614
He had been there before, of course, but as a botanist, someone exploring the plants of the region.

00:11:56.394 --> 00:12:02.254
Now he was coming back for a good so valuable that countries had gone to war for it.

00:12:03.514 --> 00:12:09.044
He had to carefully create a new persona for himself, a new look and a new identity.

00:12:10.624 --> 00:12:15.644
See, Fortune was a 6 foot tall Scotsman, he was white,

00:12:15.894 --> 00:12:19.514
he was almost 2 metres tall and had big sideburns.

00:12:20.554 --> 00:12:23.314
To state the obvious, he did not look Chinese.

00:12:24.084 --> 00:12:26.294
So, he had to get creative.

00:12:27.114 --> 00:12:32.854
His persona, his alter ego, was to be a wealthy Chinese official from

00:12:32.854 --> 00:12:37.874
the north of the country who had come to observe the manufacture of tea.

00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:46.117
He shaved his head in the traditional way, and he got someone else’s ponytail sewn into his hair.

00:12:46.884 --> 00:12:50.734
He hired a collection of local Chinese men as his guides and

00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:56.074
translators, and together they seem to have managed to fool everyone.

00:12:56.774 --> 00:13:00.054
It’s not thought that he spoke any Chinese language,

00:13:00.254 --> 00:13:03.744
but he gets the men he hired to do the talking for him.

00:13:05.164 --> 00:13:10.244
It must have been incredibly tense at times, but he gets away with it because

00:13:10.244 --> 00:13:15.104
the people he met didn’t have any knowledge of what a foreigner would look like.

00:13:15.924 --> 00:13:21.144
China was a big place, the people he met probably had never seen

00:13:21.294 --> 00:13:25.284
anyone from the north of the country, and they wouldn’t be able to

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:28.784
converse with one anyway, because they would speak different dialects.

00:13:29.314 --> 00:13:34.124
So the fact that there was this tall, white man who couldn’t speak

00:13:34.184 --> 00:13:37.854
any of their language wasn’t as strange as you might have thought.

00:13:38.892 --> 00:13:44.894
This disguise worked, and after travelling for several months deep into the Chinese

00:13:44.894 --> 00:13:51.474
interior, Fortune is allowed unrestricted access into several tea processing plants.

00:13:52.234 --> 00:13:58.294
He discovers how tea is processed, and he notes down every step in its production.

00:13:58.864 --> 00:14:03.374
How long different types of tea should be left outside to dry, how to heat the leaves,

00:14:03.584 --> 00:14:09.194
how to roll them, how to go from seed, or sapling, through to finished product.

00:14:10.204 --> 00:14:16.554
He also manages to bring with him hundreds of saplings, the little plants, which he plans

00:14:16.554 --> 00:14:22.074
to ship to India, where they can be grown, as well as back to London for observation.

00:14:23.464 --> 00:14:28.744
And if you are wondering whether he just puts them in his pocket, or he has a big tray of

00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:33.604
them like someone returning from a garden centre, no, it was slightly more advanced than that.

00:14:35.144 --> 00:14:40.074
Shortly before he had set off, a fellow Scotsman and botanist had invented

00:14:40.074 --> 00:14:45.654
something called the “Wardian Case”, which is basically a sealed glass house.

00:14:46.924 --> 00:14:54.324
What he discovered was that this sealed glass case creates its own mini ecosystem, so

00:14:54.474 --> 00:14:59.774
a plant can survive without water or other nutrients for a very long period of time.

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:05.344
It allowed plants to be transported for thousands of kilometres without spoiling.

00:15:06.024 --> 00:15:09.394
At least, it did as long as the case wasn’t opened.

00:15:10.574 --> 00:15:15.794
A year into his trip, Fortune had managed to collect 13,000 plants

00:15:15.794 --> 00:15:20.834
and 10,000 seeds, more than enough to start production back in India.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:24.384
He dutifully packed them into Wardian cases.

00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:29.614
They would be shipped first to Hong Kong and then to Calcutta, from where

00:15:29.734 --> 00:15:33.754
they would be transported to the Himalayas, a region of northern India

00:15:34.014 --> 00:15:38.104
that had a similar climate to that of the tea-producing region of China.

00:15:39.364 --> 00:15:45.314
The problem, which Fortune would only discover many months later, was that along the way

00:15:45.624 --> 00:15:51.324
a zealous official had decided to open the Wardian cases to look at the plants, thereby

00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:57.414
destroying the carefully protected ecosystem and killing all but 1,000 of the seeds.

00:15:58.344 --> 00:16:00.934
Fortune was not to be deterred.

00:16:01.314 --> 00:16:07.534
He continued his trip, collected more seeds and plants, and also recruited a group of Chinese

00:16:07.594 --> 00:16:13.114
expert tea growers who would come with him to oversee the production of Chinese tea in India.

00:16:14.674 --> 00:16:19.379
Given how closely the Chinese guarded the secret to making tea you might have thought that

00:16:19.394 --> 00:16:25.854
this would be the hardest bit, but Fortune had the financial backing of the East India Company,

00:16:26.354 --> 00:16:31.564
and it didn’t take all that much to find tea growers who were willing to come with him.

00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:33.834
So, he had it all.

00:16:34.434 --> 00:16:40.534
the knowledge of what he had seen firsthand, the plants in their protective glass cases, and

00:16:40.714 --> 00:16:46.274
a group of Chinese tea experts who would be responsible for managing the entire operation.

00:16:47.314 --> 00:16:51.584
They arrived in India, and travelled to a region of northern India that

00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:55.584
had a similar climate to that of the tea-producing region of China.

00:16:56.939 --> 00:17:00.229
As the East India company had hoped, it worked.

00:17:01.379 --> 00:17:05.039
From these little seeds and plants, and under the watchful

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:09.279
eyes of the Chinese tea growers, grew the Indian tea industry.

00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:14.999
Within a generation there was more tea coming from India than China, and

00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:20.509
finally the Chinese stranglehold over the secret of this beverage was no more.

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:25.659
It was a huge coup for Britain, and for the East India Company, which

00:17:25.659 --> 00:17:29.619
would make vast amounts of money from its northern Indian tea plantations.

00:17:30.659 --> 00:17:35.719
As to Fortune, he returned to Britain, and went on to live a quiet life.

00:17:36.829 --> 00:17:43.329
If you go to 9 Gilston Road, in London’s South Kensington, you will see a blue plaque on the wall.

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:47.649
Blue plaques are typically reserved for people of historical interest.

00:17:48.569 --> 00:17:57.889
It says “Robert Fortune lived here from 1857-1880” and lists his occupation as “plant collector”.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:04.779
By all accounts, Fortune was a modest man, and perhaps he would like the idea of

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:09.339
people walking past and thinking that he was merely a man who collected plants.

00:18:10.479 --> 00:18:16.049
In reality, he was a professional botanist, an adventurer, a spy, a travel writer,

00:18:16.159 --> 00:18:20.729
a diplomat, debatably a thief, and undoubtedly a man who changed the world.

00:18:21.429 --> 00:18:26.129
But to the residents of Gilston Road, and anyone walking by and peering at the

00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:31.609
name on the blue plaque, he is and will always remain a mere plant collector”.

00:18:33.449 --> 00:18:38.149
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Robert Fortune, the man who stole tea from

00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:38.579
China..

00:18:38.949 --> 00:18:41.839

What do you think about Robert Fortune?

00:18:49.369 --> 00:18:55.299
Heroic gardener, terrible coloniser, corporate thief, or a mixture of all three?

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:56.529
I would love to know.

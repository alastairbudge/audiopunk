Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:16.242
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:21.102
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:27.192
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about Pompeii.

00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:31.272
Now, I imagine you know a little bit about Pompeii.

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:37.822
It is the scene of probably the most famous volcanic eruption in history, a volcanic

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:44.362
eruption that stopped the clocks on an entire town, preserving it for thousands of years.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:51.942
In today’s episode we are going to, of course, tell the story of Pompeii, but we will explore

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:58.632
the questions that Pompeii makes us ask ourselves, from what is the relationship between

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:04.342
the past and the present, to how we should actually think about the people who died there.

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:10.152
I should also add that today’s episode is a request from an amazing member

00:01:10.162 --> 00:01:14.482
of Leonardo English called Silvana, so, Silvana, I hope you enjoy it.

00:01:15.652 --> 00:01:19.832
Right, let’s not waste a minute, and get started right away.

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:22.082
So, Pompeii.

00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:26.582
For those of you who need a reminder about where Pompeii actually

00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:31.702
is, it is just inland from the Bay of Naples, in southern Italy.

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:38.092
It sits on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, the volcano which was to play a

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:43.582
crucial, albeit catastrophic, role in the history of the town of Pompeii.

00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:53.212
Our story starts in the late summer or early autumn of the year 79 AD, almost 2,000 years ago.

00:01:54.352 --> 00:02:00.232
The exact dates, and specifics of what happened are still not universally

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:04.552
agreed on, but it is thought to have gone something like this.

00:02:05.602 --> 00:02:10.112
For a few days there had been small earthquakes in the area, but

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:14.802
nothing too troubling, nothing too worrying for the inhabitants.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:20.172
Small plumes of smoke were coming out of Mt Vesuvius, but

00:02:20.442 --> 00:02:25.352
this was nothing so abnormal - it seemed relatively harmless.

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:32.092
Then, around 1pm, after the pressure had been building up deep within,

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:38.042
the volcano erupted and a column of ash was shot up into the sky.

00:02:39.022 --> 00:02:45.762
Ash fell all over the nearby area, covering it in a grey cloud and a grey layer of ash.

00:02:46.812 --> 00:02:53.802
Residents of Pompeii, and all of the other nearby towns, started to flee, they started to run away.

00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:59.742
They weren’t to know what was to come, but presumably they thought that it wasn’t good news.

00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:02.672
Many did manage to escape.

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:09.003
The ash wasn’t deadly itself, it was bad for your lungs, made it hard to breathe,

00:03:09.263 --> 00:03:14.013
and made it hard to see, but it wasn't to be the thing that would actually kill you.

00:03:15.343 --> 00:03:19.353
Either some time later on that evening, or during the night,

00:03:19.743 --> 00:03:25.493
the volcano spewed out, it threw out, a huge pyroclastic flow.

00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:31.533
A pyroclastic flow is a collection of extremely hot ash and gas

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:36.243
that can travel incredibly fast, up to 700 kilometres per hour.

00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:43.533
And the temperature inside one of these deadly clouds can reach 1,000 degrees Centigrade.

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:48.523
This deadly collection of gas and volcanic matter rushed

00:03:48.543 --> 00:03:52.133
down the side of the volcano, heading straight for Pompeii.

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:57.143
Some of the residents that were still in the town and saw this coming

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:01.473
ran for their lives, while others sheltered inside their houses.

00:04:02.183 --> 00:04:04.263
But, it was to no avail.

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:10.973
As the deadly gas covered the town the people left there would have been killed almost instantly.

00:04:12.003 --> 00:04:17.673
It would have been so hot that the bodies would have been vaporised, and there’s evidence

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:24.283
that one poor person’s brain was actually melted and turned into a glass-like consistency.

00:04:25.403 --> 00:04:30.333
To put things in perspective, and give you some points of comparison, it’s

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:36.696
estimated that the eruption would have released about 100,000 times the amount

00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:41.996
of thermal energy released in the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:48.627
at its peak it would have released 1.5 million tonnes of matter every second.

00:04:49.697 --> 00:04:51.467
A pretty serious explosion, right?

00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:58.147
Now, to state the obvious, it must have been horrifying to see, and if you were

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:03.333
one of the poor souls later found in the remains, it must have been terrifying.

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:09.003
But what this tragic event has left us with is a

00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:12.353
Roman settlement, almost perfectly preserved in time.

00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:18.153
There really isn’t anything quite like it anywhere, at least that we have discovered yet.

00:05:19.503 --> 00:05:24.663
When we think of other ancient monuments or towns, they have often fallen into

00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:30.133
a state of disrepair, or they have been built over by subsequent generations.

00:05:30.443 --> 00:05:37.033
There is usually a period of time between when they stopped being used and the present day.

00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:43.113
But in the case of Pompeii, one minute there was a thriving Roman settlement, then

00:05:43.123 --> 00:05:48.773
the next it was all covered in ash and volcanic matter, its inhabitants preserved

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:55.123
standing up, a dog tied to a wall, and everything left as if time had been stopped.

00:05:56.253 --> 00:06:02.473
This is the true magic of Pompeii, and the reason it has captured so many people’s imagination.

00:06:03.603 --> 00:06:10.013
Now, before we reflect on some of the questions Pompeii gets us thinking about, let me remind you

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:17.503
of both how we know what happened, and what has happened to Pompeii since that fateful day in AD79.

00:06:18.773 --> 00:06:21.033
Firstly, how do we know what happened?

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:25.513
Well, through the letters of a Roman named Pliny The Younger.

00:06:26.383 --> 00:06:32.333
He would have been 17 at the time of the explosion, and he was residing in a settlement called

00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:39.343
Miseno, which was across the bay from both Vesuvius and Pompeii, so he was safe from the blast.

00:06:40.243 --> 00:06:44.643
He wrote a vivid description of the eruption, but he actually wrote it

00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:49.925
about it 25 years after it happened, in letters to the historian Tacitus.

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:57.603
Now, Pliny’s account of the eruption is considered to be authoritative and broadly true,

00:06:57.893 --> 00:07:03.993
but we should remember that Pliny is recalling something that happened 25 years beforehand.

00:07:05.278 --> 00:07:12.433
Pliny provides us with a vivid picture of the ash cloud, describing the ash as a blanket of snow.

00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:17.313
And his account is consistent with what archaeologists

00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:20.653
later found when excavating the town of Pompeii.

00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:25.173
After the eruption, the entire town was covered in ash and

00:07:25.183 --> 00:07:30.092
lava, it was in effect submerged, it was under the ground.

00:07:30.268 --> 00:07:35.223
There’s evidence that some thieves returned in the days and weeks after the

00:07:35.223 --> 00:07:40.443
eruption to try to steal any jewels or precious possessions that had been

00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:45.893
left behind, but in the subsequent years, subsequent centuries even, the

00:07:45.903 --> 00:07:51.203
ancient town lay below the ground, hidden, knowledge of it lost to the world.

00:07:52.223 --> 00:07:57.123
Various different people had found signs of its existence, but it wasn’t

00:07:57.203 --> 00:08:03.273
until the year 1763 that the town of Pompeii was properly rediscovered.

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:08.623
The nearby town of Herculaneum, which had been completely covered by

00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:15.163
ash in the same eruption, had been discovered in 1738, and this prompted

00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:20.403
renewed interest in unearthing Pompeii, in rediscovering Pompeii.

00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:25.793
The archeological work was complicated by the French invasion of

00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:32.603
Naples in 1799, and it wasn’t until 1863 that the famous archaeologist,

00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:37.253
Giuseppe Fiorelli, took over and things really started to progress.

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:43.333
I imagine you might be familiar with much of what they found, but let me

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:49.013
remind you about some of the most startling, the most surprising, discoveries.

00:08:50.313 --> 00:08:55.883
The first thing to mention about what they discovered is actually what they didn’t discover.

00:08:56.943 --> 00:09:03.313
They didn’t discover bodies, but instead discovered holes in the solid ash layer.

00:09:04.513 --> 00:09:07.883
You might think, hang on, I thought I had seen bodies

00:09:07.893 --> 00:09:11.003
of people in Pompeii...who were these people then?

00:09:11.933 --> 00:09:15.623
Well, what happened was that the bodies of the people who died

00:09:15.663 --> 00:09:19.633
during the eruption were completely stuck in the volcanic ash.

00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:24.973
As the years went by, their clothes and their bodies disintegrated, they

00:09:25.173 --> 00:09:31.503
biodegraded, often just leaving a pile of bones inside a cavity full of air.

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:39.073
As the archaeologists dug through the ash they found these pockets of air, with

00:09:39.343 --> 00:09:45.353
some bones at the bottom, and realised that the empty space represented the people.

00:09:46.593 --> 00:09:52.173
Fiorelli, the man leading the project, realised that you could pour in liquid

00:09:52.223 --> 00:09:58.693
plaster into the hole, and it would form an exact copy of that person’s body.

00:09:59.893 --> 00:10:05.583
So, to the question of these bodies that you might see in a museum or on a television

00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:10.963
documentary as “bodies of someone who died in Pompeii”, they aren’t the physical

00:10:10.963 --> 00:10:16.333
bodies, but they are an exact representation of that person when they died.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:22.883
Although they are copies, you could certainly make the argument that they are more ‘real’

00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:29.683
than a bag of old bones, or the decaying corpse, the old dead body, of an old king or queen.

00:10:30.683 --> 00:10:36.403
These moulds, these copies, are exact copies of the people who died in the eruption.

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:41.203
This also means that we have a different relationship with them.

00:10:42.013 --> 00:10:46.643
They are, on one level, less human, because they are made of plaster.

00:10:47.113 --> 00:10:50.153
But on another level, they are far more.

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:57.543
Unlike tombs or graves, or even skeletons that have been discovered elsewhere, the plaster moulds of

00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:03.973
the victims of Pompeii are their exact shape, their exact position at their moment of their death.

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:09.843
The bodies weren’t the only amazing thing that the archaeologists found, and I

00:11:09.843 --> 00:11:13.833
imagine that you might be familiar with some of the other amazing discoveries.

00:11:14.753 --> 00:11:19.323
Over the course of the past 150 years, excavations have uncovered

00:11:19.363 --> 00:11:23.943
the thriving town, from its well-developed amphitheatre to its

00:11:24.223 --> 00:11:29.993
bustling, busy market, from the public baths to the many brothels.

00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:36.733
Over 2,000 frescoes have been discovered, which tell the story of life in the town.

00:11:37.693 --> 00:11:42.663
In the market and shops of the town they found evidence of the food that people

00:11:42.663 --> 00:11:48.313
would eat, and one type of food in particular helped in an unexpected way.

00:11:49.153 --> 00:11:55.823
In 2008, historians used something called garum, which was a type of ancient Roman

00:11:55.823 --> 00:12:01.253
fish sauce, to help confirm the date that the eruption of Pompeii took place.

00:12:01.993 --> 00:12:06.193
Now, what exactly was this garum, and how does fish sauce

00:12:06.293 --> 00:12:09.383
help you understand what date a volcano exploded on?

00:12:10.013 --> 00:12:14.883
Those are perhaps two very valid questions that are going through your mind.

00:12:16.263 --> 00:12:22.603
Garum was made by fermenting the insides, the guts, of small fish,

00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:27.773
leaving them out together with herbs and salt for several weeks.

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:33.493
Historians believe that the ancient Romans used to eat it with almost every

00:12:33.493 --> 00:12:38.493
meal - it was a way of adding flavour to the food, and was cheaper than salt.

00:12:39.413 --> 00:12:43.573
It might not sound so enticing, so delicious, to you or me,

00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:48.323
but it is believed to have been hugely popular 2000 years ago.

00:12:49.383 --> 00:12:53.193
Now, to the question of how did a bunch of fermented fish

00:12:53.193 --> 00:12:57.443
intestines help us understand the exact date that Vesuvius erupted.

00:12:58.163 --> 00:13:03.523
Of course, they couldn’t confirm the date, but what the analysis of the garum did

00:13:03.553 --> 00:13:09.843
do was confirm that Pliny the Younger’s reported date of August 24th was possible.

00:13:10.813 --> 00:13:15.883
Scientists analysed the type of fish in the garum, and discovered that it

00:13:15.883 --> 00:13:20.833
was a type of fish common in the area in late July and early August, and

00:13:20.893 --> 00:13:24.953
this garum would normally be left to ferment for no longer than a month.

00:13:25.673 --> 00:13:30.243
So, Pliny’s date of August 24th was supported by this

00:13:30.243 --> 00:13:33.973
disgusting to me or you but delicious to the Romans, fish.

00:13:34.473 --> 00:13:35.293
Amazing, right?

00:13:36.653 --> 00:13:39.993
Moving on, let’s talk a little more about the opening up

00:13:40.013 --> 00:13:43.853
of Pompeii, and how it was perceived by early visitors.

00:13:44.863 --> 00:13:48.093
When the city was first discovered, in the late 19th

00:13:48.113 --> 00:13:51.873
century, it was just opened up, shown as it was.

00:13:53.173 --> 00:13:59.803
Visitors often remarked that it was a little chaotic and messy, and in a real state of disrepair.

00:14:00.663 --> 00:14:04.553
Obviously, one might think, the town had suffered a catastrophic volcanic

00:14:04.563 --> 00:14:09.213
eruption and been stuck under ash for the best part of 2,000 years.

00:14:10.153 --> 00:14:15.503
Then over the past 100 years conservation and restoration efforts have focussed

00:14:15.513 --> 00:14:20.603
on recreating and restoring some of the original buildings in a sustainable way.

00:14:21.573 --> 00:14:26.553
The result is now pretty outstanding, and the reconstructions bring

00:14:26.553 --> 00:14:30.593
the ancient town to life, allowing visitors to experience what

00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:34.123
life would have been like at the very moment the volcano erupted.

00:14:35.193 --> 00:14:39.273
If you have been to Pompeii you will have experienced this firsthand.

00:14:39.653 --> 00:14:44.943
You can walk through the old Roman road, you can go into the old amphitheatre,

00:14:44.943 --> 00:14:50.033
you can even visit the brothel and look at the adult-only frescoes on the wall.

00:14:50.713 --> 00:14:54.433
It truly is an amazing experience, and if you have the

00:14:54.433 --> 00:14:56.973
chance, it is something that I would highly recommend.

00:14:57.943 --> 00:15:01.333
Now, there are a few outstanding questions that many people

00:15:01.343 --> 00:15:04.623
have about Pompeii, and the volcano that stands above it.

00:15:05.503 --> 00:15:10.193
The most frequent one seems to be “will Vesuvius erupt again?”

00:15:11.213 --> 00:15:15.993
The answer to that, according to most seismologists, most experts

00:15:16.013 --> 00:15:20.563
on the subject is a resounding “yes, it is just a question of when”.

00:15:21.493 --> 00:15:28.533
Mount Vesuvius is in a dormant phase at the moment, but is regarded as an active volcano.

00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:33.283
If you go to the top, which you can very easily do, you can see the

00:15:33.303 --> 00:15:37.803
gases coming out of it, as well as some quite unpleasant smells.

00:15:38.683 --> 00:15:44.193
There hasn’t been a large eruption since 1944, when 26 people died.

00:15:44.663 --> 00:15:49.353
We are due another one, there should be another one happening relatively soon.

00:15:50.163 --> 00:15:55.353
Compared to AD79, the area around the volcano is significantly more

00:15:55.423 --> 00:15:59.393
populated, there are many more people living there than 2000 years ago.

00:16:00.083 --> 00:16:03.843
Naples is Italy’s third largest city, and the area

00:16:03.853 --> 00:16:07.353
around Mt Vesuvius is filled with towns and villages.

00:16:08.043 --> 00:16:13.973
But, of course, we have many scientific advantages that the poor residents of Pompeii didn’t have.

00:16:14.603 --> 00:16:19.223
The volcano is now under constant monitoring, it is now much easier to

00:16:19.223 --> 00:16:24.343
leave in a hurry, and if there were another eruption of a similar size to

00:16:24.343 --> 00:16:29.367
the one in AD79, then most people would likely manage to get away in time.

00:16:30.647 --> 00:16:34.987
Let us end today’s episode with a few weird and unexpected facts

00:16:35.017 --> 00:16:38.967
about Pompeii, since we are now fully acquainted with the story.

00:16:40.067 --> 00:16:45.127
Firstly, there is a theory that the residents of Pompeii didn’t actually know

00:16:45.177 --> 00:16:50.287
that Vesuvius was a volcano, they thought it was just a harmless mountain.

00:16:50.907 --> 00:16:55.277
They didn’t even have a word for volcano, and so they must have been

00:16:55.337 --> 00:17:00.377
even more surprised when this large mountain exploded and clouds of

00:17:00.377 --> 00:17:03.927
deadly gas and dust rushed down the side of the mountain towards them.

00:17:04.947 --> 00:17:10.617
Secondly, the excavations of Pompeii revealed several things that one might not first

00:17:10.617 --> 00:17:16.017
associate with the ancient Romans, or at least, don’t always appear in the history books.

00:17:16.787 --> 00:17:21.777
For starters, there was a lot of graffiti, a lot of writing on the walls of the town.

00:17:22.507 --> 00:17:26.727
Indeed, there are over 11,000 samples of graffiti that have

00:17:26.727 --> 00:17:30.627
been found, with all sorts of poems, insults, and more.

00:17:31.607 --> 00:17:35.087
There were also 25 different brothels found.

00:17:35.867 --> 00:17:40.887
For some people, when we imagine ancient Romans, we think of a very different type

00:17:40.897 --> 00:17:46.907
of society to our own, without things such as graffiti or prostitution, but the

00:17:46.907 --> 00:17:51.597
example of Pompeii makes us remember that humans really don’t change that much.

00:17:53.067 --> 00:17:58.907
And finally, something that is not only a weird fact, but also makes us remember quite

00:17:58.907 --> 00:18:04.057
how special and unique the case of Pompeii is, is the fact that the victims of the

00:18:04.057 --> 00:18:09.887
volcano were preserved for so long meaning that we know quite a lot about their bodies.

00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:14.627
Specifically, we know that most of them had excellent teeth.

00:18:15.617 --> 00:18:20.507
Teeth normally aren’t parts of the body that survive for 2000 years after

00:18:20.507 --> 00:18:25.717
death, but given the nature of how these people died, and how their bodies

00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:29.857
were preserved, scientists saw that these people had fantastic teeth.

00:18:30.657 --> 00:18:34.867
The hypothesis about why that is is that their diet would have

00:18:34.867 --> 00:18:39.077
been rich in fruit and vegetables, and had relatively no sugar.

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:42.637
So, we can all probably learn something from that.

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:47.157
Pompeii, when you stop for a minute and think about what it

00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:51.187
really tells us about the past, is completely fascinating.

00:18:51.837 --> 00:18:55.287
Our understanding of the past, in general, comes from

00:18:55.437 --> 00:18:59.647
written records and objects, not from the people themselves.

00:19:00.647 --> 00:19:05.787
Pompeii is unique in that it is an entire town, an entire civilization,

00:19:05.817 --> 00:19:10.957
complete with its residents, which was stopped in time, preserved for eternity.

00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:19.377
And although the physical bodies of the victims are long gone, the voids, the empty spaces, remain.

00:19:20.137 --> 00:19:25.987
It might sound like a gloomy way to end this episode, but I think it’s an interesting

00:19:25.987 --> 00:19:32.245
question to ask ourselves in 2,000 years from now, what might be the next Pompeii?

00:19:35.429 --> 00:19:39.817
OK then that is it for today’s episode on Pompeii.

00:19:40.357 --> 00:19:45.657
I imagine that you knew something of the story of Pompeii before, but I hope that you have

00:19:45.657 --> 00:19:50.677
learned a few new things, and it has encouraged you to think about it in a slightly different way.

00:19:51.977 --> 00:19:55.187

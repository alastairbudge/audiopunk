Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:16.348
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:20.468
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:26.838
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about three women, the Brontë

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:34.318
sisters, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne, authors of novels such as Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights.

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:41.618
This is actually part three of a three-part mini-series on great authors of the Victorian era.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:46.748
In case you haven’t listened to the first two, in part one we looked at the

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:52.378
woman often called the queen of Victorian literature, Jane Austen, and in

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:57.098
part two we looked at the great social and urban writer, Charles Dickens.

00:00:57.998 --> 00:01:03.368
The subjects of today’s episode, the Brontë sisters, come from a similar period,

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:08.608
but developed their own very different and hugely important literary style.

00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:12.918
Indeed, these three women arguably make up the most

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:17.148
extraordinary family of literary geniuses in European history.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:22.538
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get started with the Brontë sisters.

00:01:23.808 --> 00:01:28.268
As we did in the previous episodes, we’ll look at four major themes.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:32.348
The novelists’ life and upbringing, the works that they

00:01:32.348 --> 00:01:36.128
wrote, the impact of these books, and their legacy.

00:01:37.188 --> 00:01:42.768
In this episode we do have three authors, not just the one, so we’ll focus a little

00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:48.258
more on the lives and shared upbringing of the women, but, as you’ll see, their early

00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:53.608
lives and childhood tragedy will be instrumental for an understanding of their work.

00:01:54.858 --> 00:01:58.798
First, let me set the scene, to provide you with the location

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:02.898
both for the Brontë sisters’ lives, and for their novels.

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:10.118
The location is rural Yorkshire, in the north of England, in a small village called Haworth.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.688
Specifically, the Parsonage at Haworth.

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:19.768
A parsonage is the name for a house given to a clergyman, a Church of England priest.

00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:26.128
The Brontës lived in the parsonage because the girls’ father, Patrick, was the village priest.

00:02:27.218 --> 00:02:34.158
As a side note, if you remember Jane Austen, you’ll remember that her father also was a priest,

00:02:34.498 --> 00:02:40.668
but, as you’ll see, the Brontës were very different people, and writers, compared to Jane Austen.

00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:43.288
OK, back to Haworth.

00:02:43.488 --> 00:02:50.708
If you visit Haworth now, you will find a small village surrounded by wild beauty, by big

00:02:50.748 --> 00:02:58.028
empty spaces known as the Yorkshire moors – a moor is a big expanse of land that cannot be

00:02:58.028 --> 00:03:05.258
cultivated and usually is left in a natural state, covered with bogs, bushes and heather.

00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:10.951
In the first half of the 19th century, however, it wasn’t quite so isolated.

00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:15.698
It would have been surrounded by small factories and workshops

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:19.688
involved in the industries of weaving and cloth making.

00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:22.958
It was a poor, hillside village.

00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:31.188
41% of children died before they were six months old, and life expectancy was a miserable 25 years.

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:38.588
Although the Brontës were not rich, say compared to the factory owners, they were in a relatively

00:03:38.648 --> 00:03:44.461
comfortable position financially, as their mother, Maria, had a small amount of money of her own

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:50.848
which supplemented her husband’s modest salary as a minister or vicar of the Church of England.

00:03:52.058 --> 00:03:56.938
Patrick Brontë, the girls’ father, was clearly an extraordinary man.

00:03:57.558 --> 00:04:01.288
He had been born into a poor peasant family in Ireland.

00:04:01.998 --> 00:04:07.198
Through his own intelligence, enterprise and determination he had managed

00:04:07.198 --> 00:04:12.068
to secure a place at Cambridge University, graduating with a first class

00:04:12.108 --> 00:04:16.568
honours degree and securing access to the Church of England as a vicar.

00:04:17.398 --> 00:04:22.068
This was an amazingly socially upwardly mobile thing for the time,

00:04:22.408 --> 00:04:27.408
social classes were still pretty fixed, and to go from a peasant family

00:04:27.618 --> 00:04:31.548
to the most prestigious university in the country was astounding.

00:04:32.788 --> 00:04:36.368
His wife, Maria, was from a much wealthier family.

00:04:36.798 --> 00:04:39.278
Both parents were highly cultured people.

00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:44.818
At the Parsonage they had a very good library, were engaged politically and

00:04:44.948 --> 00:04:49.288
raised their family in what must have been a highly stimulating environment.

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:55.088
They had six children, all born between 1814 and 1820.

00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:59.948
Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Branwell, Emily and Anne.

00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:06.138
The most famous are Emily, who wrote Wuthering Heights, and  Charlotte, who wrote Jane Eyre.

00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:14.878
Sadly, by 1855 the only surviving member of the Brontë family was the father, Patrick.

00:05:15.968 --> 00:05:18.968
All six children and the mother would be dead.

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:24.908
So, let’s rewind a bit, back to the early 1800s, to the sisters’ upbringing.

00:05:25.978 --> 00:05:31.978
We now need to dive into the tempestuous, traumatic and colourful story of these six

00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:37.438
Brontë children, so that you can get an idea of their shared experiences growing up.

00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:44.688
Disease and death will, I'm sorry to say, feature prominently, we’ll come across a lot of this.

00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:50.818
As you’ll know, in this era, even for families like the Brontës who were able to

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:56.998
afford such luxuries as servants, early death through disease was just a fact of life.

00:05:58.218 --> 00:06:03.738
The first to die was the wife and mother, Maria, who suffered a short illness before dying

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:10.878
of cancer aged only 38 in 1821, the year after the birth of her youngest daughter, Anne.

00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:18.278
As you might imagine, the children’s father was distraught, he was incredibly sad and desperate.

00:06:19.308 --> 00:06:22.898
By all accounts it had been a happy marriage, but the man

00:06:23.068 --> 00:06:26.758
was now left widowed and with 6 young children to look after.

00:06:27.668 --> 00:06:33.078
His wife’s sister, the children's aunt, came to live with them and help raise the

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:38.448
children, but Patrick felt that he needed to find a boarding school for the older girls.

00:06:39.038 --> 00:06:42.138
A boarding school is a school where children are sent

00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:45.938
to live, in effect, for weeks or even months at a time.

00:06:46.978 --> 00:06:52.438
The problem was that the Brontës didn’t have much money, and boarding schools weren't cheap.

00:06:53.228 --> 00:06:57.068
Patrick managed to find one where the fees were reduced

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.468
for members of the clergy, for children of priests.

00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:06.348
It was called Cowan Bridge School, and the four older Brontë sisters were sent there to study.

00:07:07.148 --> 00:07:11.038
The school was a living hell, it sounded terrible.

00:07:11.468 --> 00:07:16.178
Children had to share beds, there was no warm water, they were only

00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:21.048
given burnt toast, and were often beaten and punished terribly.

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:26.138
As if this wasn’t bad enough, the two older girls, Maria and

00:07:26.138 --> 00:07:29.638
Elizabeth, contracted tuberculosis at their boarding school.

00:07:30.418 --> 00:07:36.068
They returned home, but both died in quick succession, aged 11 and 10.

00:07:37.168 --> 00:07:41.518
Charlotte and Emily were quickly taken away from this unhealthy and cruel

00:07:41.518 --> 00:07:46.618
school, but clearly chilling memories of it would stay with them for life.

00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:52.738
If you read Jane Eyre, Charlotte’s most famous novel, there’s a terrible, cruel

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:58.198
school called Lowood school which has striking similarities with Cowan Bridge School.

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:04.308
So much so, in fact, that the real school threatened to sue the

00:08:04.318 --> 00:08:08.238
publishers of Jane Eyre for their portrayal of the school in the novel.

00:08:09.258 --> 00:08:14.028
So, we now have four remaining children after the death of the oldest two.

00:08:14.608 --> 00:08:20.948
Charlotte, Branwell – who was the only son, the only male child – Emily and Anne.

00:08:21.718 --> 00:08:25.628
The rest of our story will deal with these four surviving siblings.

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:32.828
From a young age, perhaps as a way to escape the misery of the real world, the

00:08:32.848 --> 00:08:38.788
surviving Brontë children came up with their own, highly detailed, imaginary worlds.

00:08:39.358 --> 00:08:43.798
Of course, there’s nothing particularly unusual about children creating their

00:08:43.838 --> 00:08:49.298
own imaginary worlds, and every novelist, to a certain degree, creates their own

00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:54.178
stories with their own worlds, their own characters, they create their own reality.

00:08:55.278 --> 00:09:01.138
What was splendidly bizarre and unusual with the Brontës was that these imaginary

00:09:01.138 --> 00:09:07.258
worlds not only were incredibly detailed and developed, but that they continued

00:09:07.348 --> 00:09:12.688
through into adulthood, and they would go on to form the basis for the sisters’ novels.

00:09:13.688 --> 00:09:20.108
We know from family letters how, for example, Emily and Anne would pass the time on a

00:09:20.108 --> 00:09:25.258
railway journey discussing the various things that happened in their own imaginary world.

00:09:26.178 --> 00:09:31.068
These imaginary places inspired much of the early writing that allowed all

00:09:31.108 --> 00:09:36.148
the Brontë children to develop their own craft, their own skills, as writers.

00:09:36.918 --> 00:09:43.048
The Brontë sisters would set poems, plays and short stories in these self-contained,

00:09:43.218 --> 00:09:48.358
imaginary worlds, and discuss what the inhabitants of these worlds would get up to.

00:09:49.538 --> 00:09:54.338
The most influential of these imaginary, mythical landscapes was the one which

00:09:54.378 --> 00:09:59.998
Emily, helped by her younger sister Anne, created, which went by the name of Gondal.

00:10:00.858 --> 00:10:07.478
This was a place inhabited by men and women with high passions who did extreme and wild

00:10:07.498 --> 00:10:14.468
things – violent romances and extreme actions took place in this exotic land of the mind.

00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:19.788
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Gondal, would become an essential part of the

00:10:20.028 --> 00:10:24.698
inspiration for Emily's only novel, the magnificent “Wuthering Heights”.

00:10:25.328 --> 00:10:30.528
Now, moving on to the education and early careers of the four surviving

00:10:30.528 --> 00:10:35.108
Brontë children, I need to emphasise that most of their education was

00:10:35.108 --> 00:10:40.438
through the fertile, creative atmosphere of the Parsonage, their family home.

00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:46.643
It is perhaps not surprising that their formal education was relatively brief, given

00:10:46.643 --> 00:10:51.703
the terrible experience that had resulted in the early deaths of the two older sisters.

00:10:52.243 --> 00:10:56.553
There was some formal schooling, but it played a relatively small part.

00:10:57.673 --> 00:11:03.543
Perhaps the person for whom it was most important was Charlotte, whose unusual experience

00:11:03.593 --> 00:11:09.173
attending a school in the capital of Belgium, Brussels, was formative in two ways.

00:11:10.633 --> 00:11:16.063
Firstly, she had an inspirational literature teacher, who taught her how to put much more

00:11:16.063 --> 00:11:21.673
discipline into her writing and also ensured that she had an excellent facility with French.

00:11:22.593 --> 00:11:25.293
The other reason why her time in the school was so

00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:29.923
important was sentimental or having to do with the emotions.

00:11:30.983 --> 00:11:34.202
She fell in love with her teacher, Monsieur Constantin

00:11:34.202 --> 00:11:37.156
Heger, who was the husband of the headmistress.

00:11:38.273 --> 00:11:43.163
She believed that he was the first man to have taken her seriously on an

00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:47.853
intellectual level, and after she left the school she wrote him letters where

00:11:48.043 --> 00:11:53.273
she hinted at her true feelings for him, hoping that he would respond favourably.

00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:57.643
But, at least from the letters that have remained, he seemed

00:11:57.813 --> 00:12:00.738
to have got scared, and he stopped writing back to her.

00:12:01.113 --> 00:12:05.453
This theme of unreturned, or as it’s called, “unrequited”

00:12:05.473 --> 00:12:08.853
love, would be a recurrent one in Charlotte’s novels.

00:12:10.243 --> 00:12:12.633
What about the young boy, young Branwell?

00:12:13.053 --> 00:12:16.853
This episode is about the sisters, so what happened to their brother?

00:12:17.593 --> 00:12:20.793
Well, he was thought to be a talented painter and

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:24.193
pursued the life of a portrait painter for some time.

00:12:24.553 --> 00:12:27.843
He was also considered to be a talented writer and

00:12:28.053 --> 00:12:31.753
had hopes and dreams of writing for serious journals.

00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:39.453
Unfortunately, Branwell proved to be a massive disappointment to everyone, in particular to himself.

00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:46.093
He tried various jobs, then started working as a tutor to a young boy in a house

00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:50.953
called Thorp Green, where his sister Anne was tutoring the daughters of the house.

00:12:51.873 --> 00:12:55.253
Here Branwell found himself in serious trouble.

00:12:55.683 --> 00:12:59.123
He started an affair with the mistress of the house, a

00:12:59.123 --> 00:13:02.933
woman almost 20 years his senior, 20 years older than him.

00:13:03.883 --> 00:13:07.003
It seems that her marriage with her husband was an

00:13:07.043 --> 00:13:10.483
unhappy one, and the two struck up a relationship.

00:13:11.303 --> 00:13:15.663
Their affair was discovered, and Branwell was sacked in disgrace.

00:13:16.303 --> 00:13:20.373
In love with Mrs Robinson, the mistress, and ordered not to

00:13:20.373 --> 00:13:23.453
have anything to do with her, he was desperately unhappy.

00:13:23.973 --> 00:13:30.033
He sunk deeper into depression and became heavily addicted both to alcohol and morphine.

00:13:30.713 --> 00:13:36.142
These twin addictions would lead him to an early grave, aged just 31.

00:13:37.373 --> 00:13:43.193
So, let’s get back to the Brontë sisters, the surviving three: Charlotte, Emily, and Anne.

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:50.135
They are most famous for their novels, but all three of them worked as something called governesses.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.502
A governess was a blend between being a private tutor and a babysitter or childminder.

00:13:57.963 --> 00:14:02.643
See, for all the talents of the sisters, the era in which they were living

00:14:02.853 --> 00:14:07.323
meant that the potential careers open to women were extremely limited.

00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:13.878
The so-called “ideal” situation, as we explored in the Jane Austen episode, was for

00:14:13.878 --> 00:14:19.008
a woman to have enough money from her family so that another wealthy man would want

00:14:19.018 --> 00:14:24.608
to marry her, and she could live in suitable style with her money and her husband's

00:14:24.608 --> 00:14:29.498
money funding the family’s comfortable life, without ever needing to do a day’s work.

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:34.648
This was simply not possible for the Brontës, as they were

00:14:34.648 --> 00:14:38.228
not rich, therefore their marriage prospects were not good.

00:14:38.998 --> 00:14:43.768
So they prepared for the only respectable career available to them, which

00:14:43.818 --> 00:14:48.836
was being a governess, this strange mix of private tutor and childminder.

00:14:49.928 --> 00:14:54.328
Governesses would usually live in the large houses of their wealthy employers.

00:14:55.388 --> 00:14:59.598
They would be in charge of anywhere between one and five children.

00:15:00.478 --> 00:15:06.652
As well as being poorly paid, their status in the home was not high, and slightly strange.

00:15:07.392 --> 00:15:11.722
Although they would be highly educated and, in effect, private tutors,

00:15:12.012 --> 00:15:16.042
they would be treated no better than the higher-ranking family servants.

00:15:16.562 --> 00:15:21.032
However they would be seen by the servants of the house as being of a

00:15:21.242 --> 00:15:26.192
superior education and social class and would therefore have none of the

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:30.372
friendship, the camaraderie, that those servants would have with each other.

00:15:31.482 --> 00:15:35.002
It's not surprising that the miserable condition of the governess

00:15:35.232 --> 00:15:39.842
features so often in Brontë novels, and that the Brontë sisters continued

00:15:39.862 --> 00:15:44.792
to be very close as adults, with their shared “status” as governesses.

00:15:45.882 --> 00:15:51.032
So, to recap, we have these three sisters: Charlotte, Emily, and Anne.

00:15:51.372 --> 00:15:54.522
They have grown up creating their own imaginary worlds, they have

00:15:54.652 --> 00:15:58.782
known great tragedy, and their prospects in life are limited.

00:15:59.902 --> 00:16:04.302
They had written some poetry from a young age, but when they tried to publish

00:16:04.332 --> 00:16:09.242
a collection of their poems the collection sold a grand total of three copies.

00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:17.552
They decided to try to each publish a novel, and so it was that in 1847 they published three

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:23.372
books, two of which would go down as some of the finest novels ever written in English.

00:16:24.352 --> 00:16:30.362
Charlotte published Jane Eyre, Emily published Wuthering Heights, and Anne published Agnes Grey.

00:16:31.393 --> 00:16:36.233
When the novels were published, however, the surname Brontë was nowhere to be seen.

00:16:36.643 --> 00:16:41.983
They published their books under pen-names - taking the identity of male authors.

00:16:43.053 --> 00:16:45.523
Charlotte adopted the name Currer Bell.

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:49.973
Emily, the name Ellis Bell, and Anne, Acton Bell.

00:16:50.493 --> 00:16:57.123
So when the three novels had been published, by Christmas of 1847, they were known as the Bells.

00:16:58.443 --> 00:17:03.593
Although there was considerable speculation as to who the Bells were – and some

00:17:03.593 --> 00:17:08.443
questioning as to whether they were actually male – their identity remained hidden.

00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:14.983
Of the three novels published in this extraordinary year, the most successful in terms

00:17:14.983 --> 00:17:19.743
of the reading public and the critics was Charlotte's extraordinary work, Jane Eyre.

00:17:21.163 --> 00:17:26.983
This remarkable piece, narrated by a governess, Jane Eyre, has become for many readers across

00:17:26.983 --> 00:17:33.603
the globe one of the finest examples of the romantic novel - the romantic novel par excellence.

00:17:34.273 --> 00:17:37.743
It has all the necessary ingredients – frustrated love,

00:17:38.013 --> 00:17:42.873
betrayal, imprisonment, physical danger, trials and separation.

00:17:43.803 --> 00:17:48.703
Although the journey to eventual happiness for the narrator and heroine, Jane,

00:17:48.713 --> 00:17:53.526
is a dangerous one, it does reach a happy conclusion when Jane gets her man.

00:17:54.636 --> 00:18:00.486
Emily’s extraordinary work, Wuthering Heights, which was based on this imaginary world of Gondal

00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:08.156
we mentioned earlier, was a similarly extreme tale of violent passion, murder, revenge and ghosts.

00:18:09.566 --> 00:18:14.096
Now, we could spend hours or days talking about Wuthering Heights, but there’s

00:18:14.106 --> 00:18:18.236
one point I really want to stress about this novel, and its importance.

00:18:18.746 --> 00:18:23.176
And that is because it was one of the first novels in English that

00:18:23.176 --> 00:18:27.506
really dealt with the spectrum of human emotions, and showed that both

00:18:27.526 --> 00:18:32.746
men and women were capable of the same kind of feeling and passion.

00:18:33.816 --> 00:18:39.766
To compare it to the work of Jane Austen, for example, Jane Austen’s works typically deal with

00:18:39.926 --> 00:18:47.586
love and marriage, whereas the themes in Wuthering Heights range from race to class, morality

00:18:47.796 --> 00:18:53.676
to religion, really addressing deep, fundamental questions about what it is to be human.

00:18:54.796 --> 00:18:59.766
And as a reminder, this is all set in this imaginary world that Emily has

00:18:59.766 --> 00:19:04.136
been developing, in collaboration with her sisters, from a very young age.

00:19:05.226 --> 00:19:11.656
Anne’s first novel, Agnes Grey, was much more restrained and deals with a less extreme world.

00:19:12.801 --> 00:19:17.886
Her second book, incidentally, a book called The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, was

00:19:17.886 --> 00:19:22.996
considered to be so "coarse", so rough and rude, that it was barely sold or

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:29.236
read for almost 150 years because the material, which included domestic abuse,

00:19:29.506 --> 00:19:34.696
alcoholism and adultery, was considered to be too extreme for the public audience.

00:19:35.456 --> 00:19:40.672
It really started to be read and analysed again in the late 20th century, and it is

00:19:40.672 --> 00:19:46.312
now widely considered to be the first “feminist” novel, with Anne considered by many

00:19:46.312 --> 00:19:51.492
critics to be equally talented and brilliant as her far more famous older sisters.

00:19:52.612 --> 00:19:57.522
These three novels – Jane Eyre especially - were a sensation - they

00:19:57.522 --> 00:20:01.202
took the London-based readership and literary critics by storm.

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:05.852
Critics made connections between the three novels of the Bells.

00:20:06.152 --> 00:20:11.942
They referred to the "painful and exceptional subjects", and the "eccentricities

00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:16.712
of woman's fantasy" and overall the "coarseness" of emotions displayed.

00:20:17.952 --> 00:20:23.842
However, notably, as one commented "we are spellbound, we cannot choose but read…”.

00:20:24.892 --> 00:20:29.062
Famously, the highly respected and established novelist William

00:20:29.062 --> 00:20:33.232
Thackeray missed his day's appointments because he simply could not

00:20:33.252 --> 00:20:37.362
stop reading Jane Eyre and was in tears when reading the love scenes.

00:20:38.332 --> 00:20:43.712
And in case you haven’t read them, let me simply say that they are great, extraordinary

00:20:43.712 --> 00:20:48.972
and highly unusual books, written by three sisters who had suffered greatly.

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:54.990
Unfortunately, two of the sisters, Emily and Anne, were both dead

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:59.520
within two years of their publication, aged 30 and 29 respectively.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.620
After the death of her sisters, the true identity of the Bells was revealed, and

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.420
the surviving sister, Charlotte, became a literary sensation, visiting London a

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.880
number of times and becoming a favourite guest amongst London literary people.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.460
She did manage to find some happiness in marriage, but sadly

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.290
she too died young, aged only 38 and several months pregnant.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:33.590
By 1855, poor Patrick Brontë, the father, who had already lost his wife, then his

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.950
eldest two daughters in quick succession, then three of his remaining children

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.990
within a nine month period, finally had to bury his last remaining daughter.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.100
It's quite something to think about.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.570
Although none of the sisters lived a long life, the long term

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.600
legacy of these three women’s works has been extraordinary.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.540
Charlotte and Emily wrote books which defined the idea of the romantic

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.100
novel and created some of the best known characters and scenes in fiction.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.430
They redefined what was thought possible for women to write

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.570
about, and paved the way for a new generation of novelists.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.840
It's particularly powerful to think about when you know that two of

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.020
the sisters had died within 2 years of the books being published, both

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.570
before their 31st birthday, and the final sister didn’t live much longer.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.460
One can only guess how many more works of genius might have been

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.790
written if all five of the Brontë sisters had lived to old age.

00:22:37.241 --> 00:22:41.171
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Brontë sisters.

00:22:41.391 --> 00:22:45.361
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and perhaps

00:22:45.361 --> 00:22:49.841
this episode might have inspired you to pick up a copy of Jane Eyre or Wuthering

00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:54.891
Heights, either in English or in translation, and jump into these wonderful books.

00:22:55.751 --> 00:23:01.811
And with this episode comes the end of our three-part mini-series on great Victorian novelists.

00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:07.311
In case you haven’t yet listened to parts one and two, we covered Jane Austen and Charles Dickens.

00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:10.581
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:23:10.581 --> 00:23:13.411
this episode, and of this mini-series in general.

00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:17.751
Can you think of a more talented literary family than the Brontës?

00:23:18.511 --> 00:23:23.751
Of the three subjects we covered, Austen, Dickens, and the Brontës, do you have a favourite?

00:23:24.231 --> 00:23:28.321
Have you ever tried reading any of them in the original, English version?

00:23:28.611 --> 00:23:31.191
Or have you seen any of the film adaptations?

00:23:31.551 --> 00:23:33.221
If not, what is stopping you?

00:23:33.541 --> 00:23:36.561
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:16.418
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:20.828
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:27.568
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about The National Trust.

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.928
In case you haven’t heard of it before, it’s the biggest conservation

00:00:31.928 --> 00:00:37.048
charity in Europe, and is responsible for preserving large parts of Britain.

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:44.968
It is a fascinating story, and through it you’ll learn about how it started, why it was

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:50.818
able to become so big, the value it provides today to people in Britain–and of course,

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:55.948
to you as well if you visit Britain–and some of the controversy that surrounds it.

00:00:56.778 --> 00:01:02.148
I’m really excited for this episode, so without further ado, let’s get right into it.

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:10.238
The National Trust is something uniquely British, there are comparable organisations in other

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:16.898
countries, but nothing of quite the same size, or national impact, as the National Trust has.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:24.018
If you ask someone in Britain what the National Trust does, they might say something like

00:01:24.538 --> 00:01:30.678
“they own all those big houses”, or “they have the big parks”, or something along those lines.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:36.788
The National Trust does both of those things, but it is much bigger than that.

00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:43.483
It’s an organisation that is responsible for the protection, and conservation of large,

00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:50.088
historic buildings, of country houses, of parks, of the coastline, and of the countryside.

00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:53.471
And it is responsible for a lot.

00:01:54.661 --> 00:02:00.691
To give you an idea of the actual size of the area it’s responsible for, it is

00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:07.121
responsible for 2,500 kilometres squared of land, that’s an area the size of Luxembourg.

00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:10.771
Granted, Luxembourg isn’t huge.

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.011
But nor is Great Britain, really.

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:21.741
These 2,500 kilometres squared make up about 1.5% of the total land area of England, Wales

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:28.151
and Northern Ireland, so the National Trust is responsible for 1.5% of the total land area.

00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:34.571
Note, I didn’t include Scotland, because there is actually a separate National Trust for Scotland.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:41.401
It’s not just the land that the National Trust is responsible for, it also manages

00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:48.081
large proportions of the coastline, 1,260 kilometres of coastline to be precise,

00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:53.191
which is about 20% of all the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

00:02:54.311 --> 00:03:00.511
To give you an idea of exactly how much that is, it’s almost exactly the same distance as

00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:06.771
London to Madrid, as the crow flies, or if you drew a line directly from London to Madrid.

00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:12.801
One of the fantastic things about what this means, from a practical point of

00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:18.311
view, is that anyone can walk through this land, so if you want to walk along

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:23.161
vast parts of the British coastline, you can do it, thanks to the National Trust.

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:30.361
When it comes to the houses that it is responsible for, it owns over 500 historic

00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:36.721
houses, castles, parks and gardens, containing almost one million works of art.

00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:40.401
So, it is big, and it is responsible for a lot.

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:47.801
But what you might still be wondering is...why and what does ‘responsible’ actually mean?

00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:50.941
And what exactly is The National Trust?

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:58.321
To best answer those questions, and to give you an idea of the role that it plays today, we need to

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:05.101
go back to where it all started, and that is Victorian Britain, Britain in the late 19th century.

00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:10.891
By the time that Queen Victoria came onto the throne, in 1837,

00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:15.501
Britain was almost 100 years into the industrial revolution.

00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:21.821
Manufacturing had boomed, people had flocked to the cities, people had gone

00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.691
to the cities in large numbers, and a country that had been predominantly

00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:31.791
rural and agricultural had started to become industrial and urban.

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:38.353
Large areas of countryside were used for factories, cities expanded,

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:43.443
and there was an increasing feeling that the city was just expanding and

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:48.127
expanding, and the countryside of Britain was going to be swallowed up.

00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:54.967
You can see this feeling through literature and art at the time, but an excellent

00:04:54.967 --> 00:05:01.647
example of it is in the 1803 poem by William Blake called “And did those

00:05:01.647 --> 00:05:07.697
feet in ancient time”, where he talks about ‘dark, satanic mills’ - the dark,

00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:11.957
factories of the devil that were poisoning the beautiful English countryside.

00:05:12.887 --> 00:05:18.597
So, in 1895, three people got together to do something about it.

00:05:19.877 --> 00:05:25.447
Their names were Octavia Hill, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley and Sir Robert Hunter.

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:29.987
But it was Octavia Hill that was the most famous of the

00:05:29.987 --> 00:05:34.337
three, and is really the patron saint of the National Trust.

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:41.887
Hill was a fierce social reformer, and she believed in the importance of green

00:05:41.897 --> 00:05:47.947
spaces, and historic places for everyone, that every person had the right to

00:05:47.947 --> 00:05:52.945
enjoy the beauty of nature, and that something needed to be done in order to

00:05:52.945 --> 00:05:57.495
stop the English countryside from being swallowed up by industrialisation.

00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:04.555
So, in 1895, our three heroes, Octavia Hill, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley

00:06:05.065 --> 00:06:09.435
and Sir Robert Hunter, came together and established The National Trust.

00:06:10.355 --> 00:06:17.375
It started as a company, just like any other, and the idea was that it could buy and hold

00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:23.945
buildings and land, with the objective of preserving them, of saving them from being turned

00:06:23.955 --> 00:06:29.675
into factories or sold to industrialists, and allowing everyone to benefit from them.

00:06:30.935 --> 00:06:37.625
That same year, in 1895, the National Trust got its first piece of land, a small

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:43.015
piece of land near a cliff in Wales, which it was given by a philanthropist.

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:50.065
Later that year, still in 1895, it bought its first property, a 14th

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:54.735
century house in a county called East Sussex, to the south of London.

00:06:55.925 --> 00:07:02.615
It paid £10 for it, and then needed to spend an additional £350 for repairs.

00:07:03.525 --> 00:07:12.035
£10 back in 1895 is the equivalent of about £600 now, so that’s around €700.

00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:19.175
And this is broadly what the National Trust did for several decades - it received

00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:24.615
land and property as gifts from people who believed in its philanthropic mission,

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:29.915
and it also bought property with money that it had been given as a donation.

00:07:31.155 --> 00:07:37.935
For the first 50 years or so of its existence the properties it acquired were generally quite small.

00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:43.955
It was a charity, and although it did have an increasing number of supporters every year,

00:07:44.225 --> 00:07:49.105
an increasing number of people who gave it money, it still wasn’t rich by any means.

00:07:49.855 --> 00:07:54.285
But now it owns some of the most majestic, the most important

00:07:54.305 --> 00:07:58.295
buildings in the entire country, huge, beautiful country houses.

00:07:59.235 --> 00:08:01.395
How did it manage that, you might be thinking?

00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:05.295
Well, it actually comes down to tax.

00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:12.927
Starting in 1894, an inheritance tax was introduced in Britain, meaning that when someone

00:08:12.937 --> 00:08:19.447
died, any assets that they passed to their heirs, typically their children, would be taxed.

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:26.527
It increased gradually during the first half of the 20th century, then at the end of World War

00:08:26.537 --> 00:08:33.487
II, after a new Labour government was elected, it was increased dramatically, to up to 80%.

00:08:34.757 --> 00:08:41.827
So, when someone died, their heirs would have to pay up to 80% in tax to the British government.

00:08:42.737 --> 00:08:47.907
Whether this is right or wrong is another question, but the result was that

00:08:47.907 --> 00:08:53.527
many of the old, British families with these huge country houses simply

00:08:53.557 --> 00:08:58.167
couldn’t afford to pay the tax on the inheritance and keep the property.

00:08:59.367 --> 00:09:04.627
To give you a working example, if your parents owned a large country mansion,

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:09.827
a large country house, and it was left to you after they died, let’s say this

00:09:09.827 --> 00:09:15.827
mansion was valued at £10 million, you might have to pay £8 million in taxes.

00:09:16.687 --> 00:09:22.177
Now, assuming you didn’t have £8 million in your bank account, or in other assets

00:09:22.317 --> 00:09:26.627
that you could quickly sell, you would need to sell the house to pay the tax.

00:09:27.937 --> 00:09:32.717
This would mean that lots of these old, beautiful houses would be sold to

00:09:32.717 --> 00:09:36.617
the highest bidder, who could do whatever they wanted with them - knock

00:09:36.617 --> 00:09:41.147
them down, completely change them, build new villages on top of the land.

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:45.477
The National Trust offered an alternative to this, and

00:09:45.477 --> 00:09:48.587
something called the Country House Scheme was developed.

00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:56.217
In short, this meant that someone who inherited a large property but didn’t have the money to

00:09:56.237 --> 00:10:01.977
pay the inheritance tax on it could give the property to the National Trust, and the National

00:10:01.977 --> 00:10:07.987
Trust would allow that person and their family to continue to live in a part of the property.

00:10:08.857 --> 00:10:15.677
So everyone was a winner - the National Trust acquired a grand property, the heirs could continue

00:10:15.677 --> 00:10:22.135
to live in a part of that property, and the ordinary people of Britain had the right to go and

00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:27.855
visit these beautiful country houses that had previously belonged to the richest in society.

00:10:28.925 --> 00:10:33.245
Through this scheme the National Trust acquired some of the most prestigious

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:37.935
country houses in the country and they are now all open to the public.

00:10:39.325 --> 00:10:43.405
And they are, in many cases, absolutely fabulous, and if

00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:46.885
you visit the UK I would certainly urge you to visit some.

00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:49.725
You might even have been to some already.

00:10:50.965 --> 00:10:56.955
Giant’s Causeway, an amazing volcanic area by the sea in Northern Ireland is a National

00:10:56.955 --> 00:11:02.575
Trust property, as is Attingham Park, an amazing country house in the west of England.

00:11:03.665 --> 00:11:08.695
If you haven’t had the chance to visit any of them, you will probably have seen them in

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:15.485
films and TV series, from Game of Thrones to Harry Potter, and of course, Downton Abbey.

00:11:16.665 --> 00:11:20.725
It’s a unique part of British heritage, and is hugely popular.

00:11:21.586 --> 00:11:27.195
Indeed, the National Trust has 5.6 million paying members, 5.6

00:11:27.635 --> 00:11:31.935
million people who pay a membership fee to support it every year.

00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:37.585
So that’s almost one in ten people in Britain, 10% of the British population.

00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:40.475
So far so good, you might think.

00:11:41.005 --> 00:11:45.325
It’s a cultural organisation that is responsible for protecting beautiful country

00:11:45.325 --> 00:11:50.745
houses, preserving them for future generations, making them accessible to anyone

00:11:50.745 --> 00:11:56.145
who wants to visit them, and allowing anyone to visit lovely countryside landscapes.

00:11:56.775 --> 00:12:01.395
I should add that many of these sites are free to visit, you don’t have to pay.

00:12:02.565 --> 00:12:08.885
Often the larger houses do require a fee, or a donation to go in, but even in

00:12:08.885 --> 00:12:14.515
this case, the gardens and the grounds are often free to walk around and enjoy.

00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:20.865
This is made possible not only by the 10% of the British population

00:12:21.085 --> 00:12:25.937
that supports it, but also because the Trust has a huge army of

00:12:25.947 --> 00:12:30.427
volunteers, people who volunteer to work in the properties for free.

00:12:31.663 --> 00:12:37.317
There are 65,000 of these people, a huge football stadium full of volunteers

00:12:37.627 --> 00:12:42.327
who stand in often cold country houses all day long with a smile on

00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:46.267
their face because they believe in the mission of The National Trust.

00:12:47.427 --> 00:12:48.477
Quite something, right?

00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:53.707
Well, yes it is, but it has come under some recent controversy.

00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:58.993
And the best way of explaining this controversy is through a story

00:12:59.023 --> 00:13:03.083
of a property that the National Trust relatively recently acquired.

00:13:04.263 --> 00:13:07.483
There is a fantastic great house near Bristol, in

00:13:07.483 --> 00:13:10.093
the South-West of England, called Tyntesfield Manor.

00:13:11.143 --> 00:13:15.053
In 2002 it was put up for sale by its owners.

00:13:15.943 --> 00:13:23.693
The National Trust managed to raise £3 million from 50,000 individual donors, an average

00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:30.753
of £60 per donor, and together with a grant from the UK government, it bought the house.

00:13:31.989 --> 00:13:38.048
The house had been built in 1863, and was in serious need of renovation.

00:13:39.258 --> 00:13:43.498
The National Trust piled money into it to bring it back to its

00:13:43.508 --> 00:13:48.068
original glory, and it is now restored and open to the public.

00:13:49.208 --> 00:13:56.288
It’s an absolutely fantastic house, it has huge gardens, 23 main bedrooms and 47

00:13:56.598 --> 00:14:01.828
bedrooms in total - including the servants' accommodation of course - it has its

00:14:01.828 --> 00:14:06.988
own private chapel, and everything you might expect from a huge, country mansion.

00:14:08.308 --> 00:14:13.278
When it was built, in 1863, just the construction of it

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:17.788
cost today’s equivalent of £7 million, about €8 million.

00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:22.718
Where did the owner get the money to do this, you might be asking?

00:14:23.688 --> 00:14:28.438
The man who built the house was called William Gibbs, and he made

00:14:28.438 --> 00:14:33.718
his fortune selling guano, the poo, the excrement, from sea birds.

00:14:34.638 --> 00:14:38.438
As you may know, there was a lot of money to be made in guano.

00:14:39.398 --> 00:14:46.448
Gibbs exported guano from Peru, and shipped it to Europe, where it was used to produce fertiliser.

00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:51.509
Gibbs was given a monopoly on the guano trade by the Peruvian government,

00:14:51.589 --> 00:14:55.539
he was the only person allowed to export Guano from Peru to Europe.

00:14:56.859 --> 00:15:05.679
The business started small, but by 1864 he was exporting 435,000 tonnes of guano

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:11.689
to Europe, and making the equivalent of about €9 million in profit every year.

00:15:12.729 --> 00:15:17.209
Indeed, there was a song that was sung about Gibbs that goes

00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:21.779
“William Gibbs made his dibs, Selling the turds of foreign birds“.

00:15:22.559 --> 00:15:30.789
So, to explain that, dibs is a slang term for money, turd is a slang term for poo, it’s excrement.

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:34.279
So, “William Gibbs made his dibs, made his money,

00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:37.449
Selling the turds, selling the poo, of foreign birds“.

00:15:38.289 --> 00:15:42.299
Now, why is how Gibbs made his money important for our story?

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:48.909
It’s because Gibbs used slave labour from indigenous Peruvians and imported

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:54.369
Chinese labourers, these people worked in terrible conditions to collect the guano,

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:59.559
ship it to Europe, where it was turned into piles of money, and then ultimately

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:04.399
partly turned into this fantastic house that is open to the public to enjoy.

00:16:05.819 --> 00:16:10.689
Indeed, a large number of these properties that are now in the hands of the National

00:16:10.689 --> 00:16:17.099
Trust were built because of fortunes enabled by British colonialism, and by slavery.

00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:23.209
In 2020, actually before the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter

00:16:23.239 --> 00:16:28.879
demonstrations, the National Trust commissioned a report into the links between its

00:16:28.909 --> 00:16:35.695
properties and the slave trade, and unsurprisingly found that there were very strong links.

00:16:37.005 --> 00:16:42.025
Now, in many National Trust properties, including Tyntesfield Manor, there are

00:16:42.035 --> 00:16:46.765
signs up that acknowledge the links between the property and the slave trade.

00:16:48.145 --> 00:16:52.195
When these signs started going up, it divided opinion.

00:16:53.155 --> 00:16:58.855
For some, acknowledging the fact that these beautiful buildings exist partly because of

00:16:58.875 --> 00:17:06.055
slavery was the right thing to do, and indeed it’s not morally right to enjoy strolling

00:17:06.075 --> 00:17:11.215
through the beautiful gardens and houses without at least understanding the past.

00:17:12.145 --> 00:17:16.825
For others, it was political correctness gone mad, it was the left

00:17:16.935 --> 00:17:21.585
imposing different cultural norms, and why should people have this history

00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:25.745
forced upon them when all they want to do was enjoy a countryside walk.

00:17:26.855 --> 00:17:30.175
This debate is all relatively new, and is still ongoing.

00:17:30.745 --> 00:17:36.955
The report came out in September 2020, and you will see opinion articles in UK newspapers,

00:17:37.045 --> 00:17:42.265
or letters written in to the editor almost every week with strong opinions either way.

00:17:43.445 --> 00:17:46.415
Whatever your view on the matter, it’s hard to debate

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:49.595
the fact that the National Trust is a national treasure.

00:17:50.005 --> 00:17:54.755
Its original stated mission was to preserve properties that were to be kept

00:17:54.765 --> 00:18:00.095
for the enjoyment, refreshment and rest of those who had no country house.

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:06.285
And it's quite something that, 126 years later now, whether it’s enjoyment

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:11.285
or refreshment you can now find it at over 500 different country houses.

00:18:11.825 --> 00:18:15.355
And for that, we have a wonderful woman called Octavia Hill to thank.

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:22.285
Now, I can’t think of any better way to end today’s episode than with a quote from

00:18:22.295 --> 00:18:27.535
the marvelous Octavia Hill, which really sums up the philosophy of The National Trust.

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:31.195
And that is: “We all want quiet.

00:18:31.725 --> 00:18:32.725
We all want beauty...

00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:34.275
We all need space.

00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:39.085
Unless we have it, we cannot reach that sense of quiet

00:18:39.355 --> 00:18:43.235
in which whispers of better things come to us gently."

00:18:46.445 --> 00:18:51.015
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The National Trust.

00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:55.405
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that

00:18:55.425 --> 00:19:00.445
if you do manage to go to the UK, and you do go to a National Trust property, then

00:19:00.665 --> 00:19:04.775
you’ll know a little bit more about the history of this fantastic organisation.

00:19:05.605 --> 00:19:09.065
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:13.355
What’s the equivalent of The National Trust in your country, if one exists?

00:19:13.685 --> 00:19:18.685
Who, or what, is responsible for preserving the cultural heritage in your country?

00:19:19.695 --> 00:19:25.085
And of course a question that is a real hot potato, what do you think the National

00:19:25.085 --> 00:19:29.782
Trust should do about its complicated legacy with colonialism and slavery?

00:19:30.541 --> 00:19:31.435
I would love to know.

00:19:31.925 --> 00:19:34.845

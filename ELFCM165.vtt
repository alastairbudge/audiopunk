Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:17.458
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:22.078
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:27.728
I'm Alastair Budge and today is the start of another three-part

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:32.558
mini-series, this time on great American business frauds.

00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:38.218
In this mini-series we are going to look at times when companies, or

00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:43.898
individuals within companies, committed huge frauds, tricking investors,

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:49.148
employees, journalists, while becoming fabulously wealthy in the process.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:56.818
In today’s episode, the first episode, we are going to talk about Enron, the mysterious

00:00:56.848 --> 00:01:03.188
energy trading company that was once the poster child of American success, the company

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:09.748
that couldn’t stop making money, but eventually came crashing down, resulting in lengthy

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:17.148
prison sentences, billions of dollars wiped out, thousands of jobs lost, and even a suicide.

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:23.028
Then, in part two, which is going to come out on Friday, we are going to look

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:28.738
at Theranos, the company that promised to revolutionise the world of blood

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:34.608
testing, and save millions of lives by making it easier to detect diseases.

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:40.608
A noble mission, of course, but it was a fraud, it was one great lie.

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:46.608
And in part three, our final part, which will come out next Tuesday we

00:01:46.608 --> 00:01:52.048
will end with perhaps the biggest fraudster in history, Bernie Madoff.

00:01:52.688 --> 00:01:56.098
He was the darling of Wall Street, a man who made his

00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:59.818
clients, and himself, hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:04.988
But it turned out that he wasn’t so special at all, he was merely

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:09.798
the mastermind behind the biggest Ponzi scheme in American history.

00:02:10.448 --> 00:02:14.218
So, that is what you have coming up in the next three episodes.

00:02:15.238 --> 00:02:19.628
Let’s not waste a minute then, and start with the story of Enron.

00:02:21.482 --> 00:02:25.228
Our story starts with a man named Kenneth Lay.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:33.128
He was born in Missouri, in the American midwest, in 1942, the son of a baptist minister.

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:39.048
He grew up in poverty, there was never much money around when he was a child.

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:46.098
On graduating from university, he took a job at an oil company, before

00:02:46.168 --> 00:02:50.488
working inside The Pentagon, the heart of the American Defense Department.

00:02:51.548 --> 00:02:57.662
After a couple of years working for the state, he returned to the private sector, taking jobs

00:02:57.762 --> 00:03:03.552
with a variety of different energy companies, and working his way up the corporate ladder.

00:03:04.782 --> 00:03:11.062
By 1985 he was in control of a company called Houston Natural Gas, which

00:03:11.092 --> 00:03:15.112
later changed its name to Enron when it was bought by a competitor.

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:22.852
The 1980s had seen the energy sector in the US opening up, it had seen deregulation.

00:03:24.062 --> 00:03:28.482
What this meant in practical terms was that there was more competition

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:32.992
and more room for private companies to step in and make money.

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:39.372
Kenneth Lay, and his company Enron, were perfectly poised to benefit from this.

00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:43.982
What Enron did, or at least what it started out by doing,

00:03:44.252 --> 00:03:47.872
was by transporting and selling oil and natural gas.

00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:54.792
It owned around 60,000 kilometres of pipeline, which would be used to transport natural

00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:59.382
gas around the country, from where it was produced to where it was going to be used.

00:04:00.432 --> 00:04:01.662
All simple so far.

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.832
But this business wasn’t actually very profitable.

00:04:06.332 --> 00:04:11.612
Enron had been struggling to compete, and was at risk of going bankrupt.

00:04:12.532 --> 00:04:19.762
It was kept afloat, it was kept alive, partly by a new activity, by a new business division.

00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:26.902
Oil and gas trading, speculating on whether the price of oil or gas would rise or fall.

00:04:27.912 --> 00:04:34.632
This was where the real money seemed to lie, and Enron started making vast amounts of cash.

00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:40.092
Oil trading is normally a risky business, because there are all sorts of

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:44.722
factors that can influence the price, and the price goes up and down a lot.

00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:52.212
In the 1970s and 1980s there were huge swings, huge variations in the oil price.

00:04:53.032 --> 00:04:58.912
But Enron always seemed to be on the right side, it always seemed to make money.

00:04:59.872 --> 00:05:01.992
This seemed a little suspicious.

00:05:02.632 --> 00:05:08.762
Early warning signs about bad behaviour in the company came in 1987, when it

00:05:08.762 --> 00:05:14.032
was discovered that a group of Enron traders had been betting vast amounts

00:05:14.032 --> 00:05:19.032
of money, much more than they should have, on the price of oil, and taking

00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:23.602
money from the company and putting it into their own hidden bank accounts.

00:05:24.452 --> 00:05:30.912
There were internal investigations and exactly what these traders had been doing was discovered.

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:35.752
Not only had they been taking this money and putting it into hidden

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:41.002
accounts, but they had been destroying documents, destroying evidence.

00:05:41.722 --> 00:05:48.952
It all seemed to be a joke to them, with one trader even sending money to a fake account named

00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:57.802
M Yass, a joke name, which if you move the position of the y to behind the m becomes “my ass”.

00:05:58.682 --> 00:06:03.392
Yet Ken Lay, the boss of the company, didn’t seem to care.

00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:07.052
The traders weren’t fired, or even disciplined.

00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:13.972
Even though they had been taking money from the company, and behaving in a dishonest way,

00:06:14.432 --> 00:06:20.552
they were making so much money for Enron that Lay couldn’t bear the idea of losing them.

00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:24.112
If they were sacked, Enron would be in trouble.

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:29.352
Indeed, the company didn’t fire them, but sent the head

00:06:29.412 --> 00:06:33.482
trader a letter saying “Please keep making us millions”.

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:40.192
The traders were allowed to continue working for Enron, and were encouraged to take

00:06:40.202 --> 00:06:45.892
greater and greater risks, with a view to making larger and larger profits for the company.

00:06:46.842 --> 00:06:52.682
But, as we now know, oil trading was a very risky business, and two months

00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:58.512
later, after a few risky bets the same trading division that had previously

00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:04.102
made Enron millions, lost $90 million over the course of five days.

00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:10.052
Even though Enron might have accepted these traders’ excuses, the US

00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:14.972
government didn’t, and when their actions were discovered also by the

00:07:14.972 --> 00:07:20.482
SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, they were sentenced to jail.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:24.802
Enron was suddenly without its top money-makers.

00:07:25.062 --> 00:07:28.832
Ken Lay and Enron corporation needed a new plan.

00:07:29.812 --> 00:07:34.632
And when an American corporation needs a new plan, a new strategy, the

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:40.642
tried and tested idea is to fly in management consultants to fix things.

00:07:41.412 --> 00:07:45.882
And the most prestigious management consultancy, where the advice of

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:50.332
a single person can run into the tens of thousands of dollars a day,

00:07:50.602 --> 00:07:54.812
is called McKinsey & Company, normally just shortened to McKinsey.

00:07:55.742 --> 00:08:04.062
McKinsey was hired by Enron after the 1987 trading scandal to advise on new ways of making money.

00:08:05.232 --> 00:08:08.992
One McKinsey consultant in particular impressed Enron.

00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:14.962
His name was Jeffrey Skilling, and he will have a pivotal role in our story.

00:08:16.062 --> 00:08:20.722
Skilling proposed that Enron become a sort of energy trading

00:08:20.722 --> 00:08:25.182
house, more like a financial company than an energy company.

00:08:26.232 --> 00:08:32.772
Instead of dealing with the messy work of transporting oil and gas, what if

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:38.982
Enron created a sort of stock exchange for energy, a place where buyers and

00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:44.222
sellers could meet, and Enron would of course take a slice of every transaction.

00:08:45.492 --> 00:08:50.982
Ken Lay, the boss of Enron, knew how profitable the trading business

00:08:50.992 --> 00:08:55.272
had been for the company, Skilling’s idea came at the right time,

00:08:55.652 --> 00:09:01.092
and Jeffrey Skilling was hired to start something called Enron bank.

00:09:01.902 --> 00:09:07.942
Skilling’s other major suggestion to Enron was to switch the way it did its accounting.

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:13.832
Enron had previously used a straightforward, simple way of accounting.

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:19.052
If it bought or sold oil or gas, or was paid for transporting

00:09:19.052 --> 00:09:22.162
it, these numbers would be added to its accounts.

00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:23.132
Easy.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:29.672
But Skilling proposed that Enron adopt something called market-to-market accounting.

00:09:30.722 --> 00:09:34.742
To put it simply, this meant that Enron could say that

00:09:34.752 --> 00:09:39.162
it had made money even if it hadn’t actually yet made it.

00:09:39.982 --> 00:09:45.812
It allowed the company to look at deals it had done, value them itself,

00:09:45.892 --> 00:09:50.822
and book the profits, to account for these profits in its accounts.

00:09:51.952 --> 00:09:58.362
The result of this was that, from an accounting point of view, Enron seemed to be making more

00:09:58.362 --> 00:10:03.642
and more money, it seemed to be a business that was printing money left right and centre.

00:10:04.212 --> 00:10:09.062
Yet these profits weren’t actually realised profits, they were just

00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:13.902
estimates of the profits that the business said it would make in the future.

00:10:14.752 --> 00:10:17.392
Why would a company do this, you might ask?

00:10:18.022 --> 00:10:20.902
Well, Enron was a publicly traded company.

00:10:21.352 --> 00:10:25.452
The more money that outsiders thought it was making, the more

00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:29.382
desirable it would be, and the higher the share price would go.

00:10:30.402 --> 00:10:35.112
Enron executives were normally given large amounts of shares, and so

00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:39.152
the higher the share price, the more money they made individually.

00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:45.132
In the case of senior executives, these sums were astronomical.

00:10:46.242 --> 00:10:53.592
Kenneth Lay, the boss of Enron, made $220 million in cash and shares in only

00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:59.552
3 years, and traders were routinely making tens of millions of dollars a year.

00:11:00.712 --> 00:11:05.512
The other thing that Skilling did was to change the character of the company.

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:12.472
He was a deeply competitive person, and believed that humans thrive on competition.

00:11:13.492 --> 00:11:18.692
At Enron he fostered a culture of dog-eat-dog, of people competing

00:11:18.692 --> 00:11:21.652
to be number one, to make the most money for the company.

00:11:22.642 --> 00:11:25.682
There were frequent performance reviews at the company

00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:29.872
where every employee was given a score of 1 to 5.

00:11:31.032 --> 00:11:35.422
1 was excellent, and meant you were in line for promotion, and more money.

00:11:35.952 --> 00:11:40.882
5 was the worst, and if you got a 5 you would be fired.

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:47.932
10% of employees had to be given a 5, meaning there was a ruthless culture

00:11:48.102 --> 00:11:52.222
of employees working all hours of the day to try to make the company

00:11:52.222 --> 00:11:56.362
as much money as possible, and be ranked higher than their colleagues.

00:11:57.282 --> 00:12:01.872
As all of this was happening, the energy sector was deregulating further.

00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:08.782
Enron’s traders used all sorts of tricks to drive up the price of the energy it was

00:12:08.782 --> 00:12:15.282
selling, even doing things like moving energy from one state to another, cutting off the

00:12:15.282 --> 00:12:21.132
power, and then selling it back to states at a higher price when they needed it most.

00:12:22.352 --> 00:12:27.032
It’s estimated that in the state of California alone this kind of

00:12:27.092 --> 00:12:32.412
unethical behaviour cost the state government $30 billion dollars.

00:12:33.502 --> 00:12:39.112
The late 1990s also saw the dotcom boom, with technology companies going

00:12:39.112 --> 00:12:44.862
public at huge valuations, and making people vast fortunes in the process.

00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:52.062
Enron wanted to get in on this and it teamed up with Blockbuster, the video

00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:57.802
rental company, to build a broadband network, and created its own broadband unit.

00:12:58.842 --> 00:13:03.782
As soon as the deal was signed, Enron recorded bumper profits,

00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:08.804
saying that this broadband unit would be worth $35 billion.

00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:13.214
Yet nobody actually knew what it was worth.

00:13:13.534 --> 00:13:19.015
It certainly seemed unlikely that it was worth anywhere near $35 billion,

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:24.714
but this new system of market-to-market accounting meant that Enron

00:13:24.724 --> 00:13:30.294
was free to claim this as a profit, yet again boosting its share price.

00:13:30.984 --> 00:13:33.864
Enron seemed to be able to do no wrong.

00:13:34.306 --> 00:13:39.146
Its employees were making vast amounts of money, its shareholders were getting

00:13:39.146 --> 00:13:45.216
rich, and it seemed to be a great success story of the merits of deregulation.

00:13:46.116 --> 00:13:50.566
Ken Lay was a great storyteller, a charismatic man, and

00:13:50.626 --> 00:13:54.076
he sold the story that Enron was enabling the future.

00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:58.266
Almost everyone bought it, but some didn’t.

00:13:59.166 --> 00:14:04.646
One journalist, a lady named Bethany McLean, even asked an Enron executive

00:14:04.956 --> 00:14:09.356
“How exactly does Enron make its money?”, to which the answer was–and

00:14:09.376 --> 00:14:13.036
I’m paraphrasing here– “it’s complicated and I don’t want to tell you”.

00:14:14.326 --> 00:14:18.336
As more people started to look more closely at the inner

00:14:18.336 --> 00:14:22.046
workings of Enron, they started scratching their heads.

00:14:22.936 --> 00:14:25.566
A lot of it didn’t make a huge amount of sense.

00:14:26.646 --> 00:14:33.946
Then, abruptly in August 2001, Jeff Skilling resigned, citing personal

00:14:33.946 --> 00:14:37.926
reasons, saying he was leaving for reasons unrelated to the job.

00:14:38.976 --> 00:14:44.826
He had taken over as CEO of Enron 6 months before, and analysts saw

00:14:44.856 --> 00:14:49.756
that he had sold $33 million worth of shares just before resigning.

00:14:50.546 --> 00:14:56.446
These didn’t seem to be the actions of a man who was really leaving for personal reasons.

00:14:57.386 --> 00:15:01.126
A day later an executive wrote an anonymous letter to

00:15:01.366 --> 00:15:05.036
Kenneth Lay, saying that the company was about to implode.

00:15:05.586 --> 00:15:07.746
It was the start of the end for Enron.

00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:12.006
In September the New York Times published an article

00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:15.286
saying “Something is wrong with the state of Enron”.

00:15:15.716 --> 00:15:21.046
The share price crashed, and Enron admitted that various divisions were

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:25.416
worth billions of dollars less than it had previously said they were.

00:15:27.086 --> 00:15:31.526
As the curtains were raised on the inner dealings of the company, it was

00:15:31.526 --> 00:15:37.446
revealed that it had used all sorts of complex structures to pretend that it was

00:15:37.446 --> 00:15:42.116
making huge amounts of money, and hide how much money it was actually losing.

00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:50.816
Its high-flying CFO, the finance boss, who was described as a man with no moral compass, had

00:15:50.836 --> 00:15:57.286
created these complex structures which allowed Enron to show its profits and hide its losses,

00:15:57.556 --> 00:16:02.906
making it look like a flourishing business when in fact it was completely the opposite.

00:16:03.966 --> 00:16:09.916
At the same time, he had paid himself tens of millions of dollars personally to

00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:16.126
manage these dubious structures on top of the huge salary he was getting from Enron.

00:16:17.156 --> 00:16:20.826
By the end of November, Enron was on its last legs.

00:16:21.266 --> 00:16:27.146
Its share price had tumbled from over $90 in August of 2000 to

00:16:27.156 --> 00:16:33.096
being worth 61 cents in November a year later, a loss of over 99%.

00:16:34.776 --> 00:16:39.506
And on December 1st the business was officially declared bankrupt.

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:44.556
Tens of thousands of employees lost their jobs, as well as losing

00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:47.956
all of their pension money that they had invested in the company.

00:16:48.916 --> 00:16:54.206
Enron executives had persuaded employees to invest their life savings,

00:16:54.326 --> 00:16:59.466
as well as their pensions, in Enron shares, while knowing full well that

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:04.056
it was a huge fraud, that the company had been inflating its profits.

00:17:05.186 --> 00:17:12.766
In the aftermath of the collapse, senior executives including Lay and Skilling were tried in court.

00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:17.776
Lay was charged with 11 counts of fraud, but died of

00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:20.656
a heart attack before ever spending a night in prison.

00:17:21.756 --> 00:17:26.736
Jeffrey Skilling, on the other hand, was sentenced to 24 years in prison.

00:17:27.446 --> 00:17:31.646
He served 13 years, and was released in 2019.

00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:34.266
Another executive, J.

00:17:34.266 --> 00:17:38.526
Clifford Baxter, shot himself in the head before he could stand trial.

00:17:39.596 --> 00:17:46.296
The scandal also saw the downfall of one of America’s oldest accounting firms, Arthur Andersen.

00:17:47.136 --> 00:17:52.166
The firm was in charge of Enron’s accounts, so should have seen what was going on.

00:17:53.226 --> 00:18:00.726
Yet Enron was too big, too profitable, and Arthur Anderson didn’t want to lose its golden goose.

00:18:01.786 --> 00:18:07.016
Arthur Anderson wasn’t just guilty of doing nothing, it was actively complicit, and

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:13.906
helped Enron shred over a tonne of incriminating evidence, hiding it from investigators.

00:18:14.486 --> 00:18:16.536
And it too collapsed with Enron.

00:18:17.716 --> 00:18:21.656
Since the fall of Enron, there have been numerous new laws

00:18:21.686 --> 00:18:26.126
implemented to try to avoid a similar situation happening again.

00:18:27.226 --> 00:18:31.776
This might certainly help, but almost all of the individuals

00:18:31.786 --> 00:18:35.616
responsible for the crimes at Enron are now walking free.

00:18:36.296 --> 00:18:40.766
Indeed, one of the first things that Jeffrey Skilling did, on his

00:18:40.766 --> 00:18:44.586
release from prison, was start up a new energy trading business.

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:49.566
He was banned by the government from serving as an officer in a public

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:53.836
company, but there is nothing to stop him from working for a private company.

00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:58.686
One has to only hope that his 13 years in prison will have

00:18:58.686 --> 00:19:01.996
taught him to behave a little bit better this time round.

00:19:03.766 --> 00:19:12.036
Ok then, that is the story of The Enron Scandal, a story of unadulterated greed, a story of

00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:18.846
financial engineering gone wrong, a story of what can happen when executives become addicted to

00:19:18.876 --> 00:19:24.826
quarterly earnings reports, and of when profits need to be bigger and bigger every three months.

00:19:25.476 --> 00:19:29.866
It is a fascinating story, and shows the lengths that people will

00:19:29.886 --> 00:19:34.286
go to to make money, and then try to cover their tracks afterwards.

00:19:35.466 --> 00:19:39.076
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:19:39.396 --> 00:19:42.996
Have there been similar scandals, or frauds in your country?

00:19:43.296 --> 00:19:45.086
Do you remember the Enron scandal?

00:19:45.646 --> 00:19:49.576
What do you think it tells us, if anything, about human nature?

00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:51.526
I would love to know.

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:54.956

And as a reminder, this is part 1 of our 3-part series.

00:20:05.186 --> 00:20:11.226
Next up we will have Theranos, the blood testing startup, and the lady who went from

00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:17.866
being the world’s youngest female self-made billionaire to being exposed as a huge fraud.

00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:22.356
And part three will be on the most prolific fraudster of

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:27.276
them all, the man who stole $65 billion, Bernie Madoff.

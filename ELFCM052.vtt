Hello, hello, hello and welcome to

00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:11.952
English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:15.402
The show where you can learn fascinating things about

00:00:15.402 --> 00:00:19.542
the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:21.282
I'm Alastair Budge.

00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:28.002
Today we are talking about a book that I imagine you may have heard of.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.582
It's more than a book though.

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:32.427
It is a cult.

00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:38.067
It's something that is turned from an argument between two men in a

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:45.177
field into a multimillion pound empire and a feature of popular culture.

00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:52.137
That's right, today it is time to talk about the Guinness World Records.

00:00:53.511 --> 00:00:57.064
Before we get right into it, for those of you who didn't manage

00:00:57.064 --> 00:01:01.984
to listen to the last episode, I just wanted to remind you that we are now

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:07.714
doing one episode a week that is available to everyone, that's today's episode.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.794
We will still make two episodes a week though, so to

00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:16.144
listen to the other one, you will need to be a member of Leonardo English.

00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:20.764
If you want to find out more about that change, then you can listen to

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:24.994
the last episode that we did where I explained the reason behind it.

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:29.358
To celebrate this change though, and the launch of our new

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:34.908
Listener membership, you can become a Listener member for just four euros

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:42.353
a month, 48 euros a year, if you use the promo code April4 AP R I L 4.

00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:49.203
Becoming a member of Leonardo English means that you get access to every episode we've ever

00:01:49.203 --> 00:01:55.773
released, plus the ability to request episode topics and participate in Q and A sessions.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:03.417
So if you are interested, the link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:09.252
Okay then let's talk about the Guinness World Records.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:15.562
For those of you who are old enough to remember life before smartphones,

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:20.512
I imagine you can recall times where you would be chatting with

00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:26.272
a friend and you would disagree on a particular fact or figure.

00:02:27.242 --> 00:02:33.002
Maybe that was the capital city of a country, how heavy a particular type of

00:02:33.032 --> 00:02:37.892
animal was, or how many times a football team won the league.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:42.422
You would be sure that the answer was one thing,

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:45.632
but your friend would be sure it was something else.

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:49.502
Or maybe neither of you had any idea.

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:55.875
These kinds of conversations, at least in the UK, tended to happen

00:02:55.875 --> 00:03:02.455
in a pub over a pint or sometimes more than one pint, I should say, of beer.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.418
Now, the arrival of the internet and

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:11.248
smartphones has removed all of the magic from this situation.

00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:17.918
People now can just look it up and a conversation barely lasts

00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:22.738
a minute before someone inevitably says, I'll just Google it.

00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:27.568
But before smartphones, you will remember that it wasn't

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:33.328
quite so easy to solve an argument, to solve these kinds of conversations.

00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:40.503
You could ask someone, another friend, but then that wasn't normally reliable either.

00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:43.725
If you had a computer with the internet back

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:47.325
home, you could wait until you got back then to Google it.

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:49.875
But what about before then?

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.895
You would consult a book, you'd go to the library

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:57.975
or try to find some kind of resource with the information in.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.895
So what is the connection between this and

00:04:02.895 --> 00:04:05.775
the Guinness Book Of Records, you may be asking yourself?

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:10.495
Well, it is that the history of the Guinness World

00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:14.965
Records can be traced back to a very similar event.

00:04:16.315 --> 00:04:23.665
In the early 1950s a man called Sir Hugh Beaver was at a shooting event in Ireland.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.070
He was the managing director of the Guinness brewery, Ireland's famous dark beer.

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:38.686
At this shooting event, he and the group he was with couldn't

00:04:38.686 --> 00:04:46.371
agree on what was Europe's fastest game bird, the fastest bird people would hunt.

00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:52.821
It was almost half a century until Google and the worldwide web

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:58.341
appeared, and so there was no easy way to resolve this debate.

00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:07.251
They consulted, they looked through, various reference books, but couldn't find anything

00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:13.371
that answered their question, that told them what the fastest game bird in Europe was.

00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:20.001
So, Sir Hugh, the boss of Guinness brewery, had an idea.

00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:27.551
He thought he could create a marketing campaign, a promotion for Guinness,

00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:33.221
based on the idea of solving these pub arguments, Alastair Budge:

00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:38.561
these debates that went on typically in pubs over a pint of beer.

00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:45.681
The idea was they could create a book that would solve these

00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:51.741
pub arguments so that the next time two friends were arguing over what was the

00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:58.706
heaviest kind of dog or the most goals scored in a world cup match, or the oldest

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:05.276
person to have ever lived, they could consult this book made by Guinness and it

00:06:05.276 --> 00:06:11.126
would make them feel all happy about Guinness and perhaps even order another beer.

00:06:12.695 --> 00:06:16.375
To do this, Sir Hugh Beaver was recommended

00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:22.505
to speak to a pair of twins called Norris and Ross McWhirter.

00:06:24.735 --> 00:06:31.580
These twins, the McWhirters had made a career out of facts and statistics.

00:06:32.198 --> 00:06:36.285
They had an agency, a small company that supplied

00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:41.775
facts and statistics to newspapers and advertisers in London.

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:49.797
They also, reportedly, both had a photographic memory, which I guess

00:06:49.827 --> 00:06:55.182
is pretty useful when you're dealing in the business of lots of facts and figures.

00:06:56.548 --> 00:07:01.237
Beaver, the boss of the Guinness factory, knew he had found

00:07:01.237 --> 00:07:07.597
the right people for the job, and so he hired the twins to create his book.

00:07:09.087 --> 00:07:16.169
And they worked tirelessly on the project, reportedly putting in 90-hour weeks

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:24.394
over the course of a thirteen and a half week period, working nights, weekends, and bank holidays.

00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:28.774
And after this three month period, the

00:07:28.774 --> 00:07:33.394
first Guinness Book Of Records was done, it was complete.

00:07:35.494 --> 00:07:42.639
Around a thousand copies were printed and they were given out for free, the idea being

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:48.609
that people could read them while they were enjoying a refreshing pint of Guinness.

00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:53.368
But when it was first published, neither

00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:58.348
the twins nor Guinness were to know what they had started.

00:08:00.398 --> 00:08:05.768
It was to go on to become the best selling copyrighted book of all time,

00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:12.978
having sold more than 140 million copies in 100 different countries.

00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:21.181
And it is now, almost 70 years later, a huge media empire with

00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:28.021
millions of subscribers on YouTube, its own TV shows, corporate events, and more.

00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:32.881
Record-breaking is big, big business.

00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:40.906
If you are wondering how or why there is a record for the most people chewing

00:08:40.906 --> 00:08:45.297
bubblegum at the same time, or the largest paella, this

00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:51.972
is because you can now apply to set a Guinness World Record for, well, almost anything.

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:57.552
I can remember when I was a kid, we used to always ask for a

00:08:57.552 --> 00:09:03.252
copy of the Guinness Book Of Records at Christmas, and it was always amazing to

00:09:03.462 --> 00:09:09.222
leaf through this book, to browse the book, and look for the weirdest records.

00:09:10.452 --> 00:09:15.792
But over the years, the records have got stranger and stranger.

00:09:16.898 --> 00:09:20.498
Before we go onto the next part, I just wanted to share a few of my

00:09:20.598 --> 00:09:27.338
favourite records, mainly because they are all quite strange and some pretty gross.

00:09:29.408 --> 00:09:32.468
First up is a man called Donald Gorske

00:09:33.008 --> 00:09:37.558
who set the record for the most McDonald's Big Macs eaten.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:50.048
In 2012 he ate his 26,000th Big Mac, after eating multiple Big Macs every day for 40 years.

00:09:51.878 --> 00:09:59.018
Amazingly, he has lower than average cholesterol, which I have to say I find quite hard to believe.

00:10:00.528 --> 00:10:05.508
Then there are the weird collectors, people who have managed to get into

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:11.028
the record books for the largest collection of slightly unorthodox things.

00:10:12.943 --> 00:10:18.743
Steve Sansweet, another American, has 300,000 individual

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:27.803
Star Wars collection items, while a woman called Charlotte Lee has 5,631

00:10:28.013 --> 00:10:33.893
rubber ducks, those strange yellow ducks that you can put in your bath.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.198
There are, of course, the physical records, records that are

00:10:39.258 --> 00:10:43.008
far more fun when you can actually see a picture of the person, Alastair Budge:

00:10:43.008 --> 00:10:48.408
but I'm sure you've probably seen a picture of someone like Robert Wadlow,

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:53.863
who was the tallest man in the world, at two meters 72 centimetres.

00:10:55.433 --> 00:11:01.733
Or the woman with the longest fingernails in the world, which I definitely find pretty disgusting.

00:11:03.172 --> 00:11:07.162
When the Guinness Book Of Records was first created, when it was

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:13.012
first thought up as an idea, it was meant to be just this collection of facts

00:11:13.282 --> 00:11:18.202
that already exist, collection of records that already existed in the world.

00:11:19.687 --> 00:11:26.887
But it has now created this entire industry of record-breaking people,

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:34.057
companies, and organisations wanting to be a record-breaker for almost anything.

00:11:35.907 --> 00:11:41.517
And there are big teams now at Guinness World Records that will help you,

00:11:41.697 --> 00:11:46.107
they will guide you through the process of becoming a record breaker.

00:11:47.732 --> 00:11:55.352
If you want this guided service, it's certainly not cheap, costing $800 or a lot more

00:11:55.622 --> 00:12:00.032
if you are a company trying to promote your product, as we will discuss in a minute.

00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:05.237
And because of how popular becoming a record-breaker has

00:12:05.237 --> 00:12:10.877
become, Guinness World Records has had to set out some guidelines on what

00:12:10.877 --> 00:12:16.237
can actually make it into the book, what is a real record and what isn't.

00:12:18.537 --> 00:12:26.037
According to their website, a good rule of thumb, a general rule, is 'if you can't

00:12:26.037 --> 00:12:32.847
measure it, you can't weigh it and you can't count it, then it's probably not a record'.

00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:39.193
It is a pretty fascinating concept, the idea that there has been

00:12:39.193 --> 00:12:45.973
this entire industry created based on encouraging people to do weird things and

00:12:45.973 --> 00:12:52.183
break records, to be a Guinness world record breaker, even if the thing that they

00:12:52.183 --> 00:12:58.663
are doing probably is so strange that nobody else will have attempted it before.

00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:05.434
Things like the fastest person to run the hundred metres are

00:13:05.464 --> 00:13:12.604
of course, perfectly valid records, but the biggest mosaic of postage stamps

00:13:13.114 --> 00:13:19.254
or the biggest line of cereal boxes that have been knocked over like dominoes?

00:13:20.014 --> 00:13:24.711
Well, I wonder how many people have ever actually tried that before.

00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:30.941
But this leads us on to discovering how Guinness World

00:13:30.941 --> 00:13:35.711
Records has become such a huge industry and a huge business.

00:13:37.221 --> 00:13:41.841
It is the big companies, the sponsors who are using Guinness World

00:13:41.841 --> 00:13:47.061
Records as a way of marketing or drawing attention to what they do.

00:13:48.224 --> 00:13:50.294
That world record for the biggest

00:13:50.294 --> 00:13:53.264
mosaic of postage stamps that I mentioned a minute ago?

00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:56.874
That was set by the Spanish postal service.

00:13:58.414 --> 00:14:03.364
The record for the largest loop the loop in a car, you know when

00:14:03.364 --> 00:14:07.114
a car drives up and around in a circle and it goes upside down?

00:14:07.834 --> 00:14:14.824
That record was set by the car maker Jaguar to promote the launch of a new model.

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:22.049
And the record for the most cereal boxes that were knocked over in a line like dominoes?

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:25.339
Surprise, surprise, that was Kellogg's.

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:32.839
And of course, these companies are paying large, large sums of money to

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:37.579
Guinness World Records for all this, for the promotion of their products.

00:14:39.289 --> 00:14:43.849
When you think about the history of the Guinness Book Of Records and how

00:14:43.939 --> 00:14:50.539
this little book was first created as a way to promote Guinness to solve pub arguments,

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:58.009
I think it's a fascinating twist that now it is turned into this huge publishing and

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:05.539
media empire that relies to a large extent on promoting other companies, allowing

00:15:05.539 --> 00:15:12.619
them to create their own records and of course pay handsomely for the privilege.

00:15:14.349 --> 00:15:20.139
Even more interesting and quite funny on one level is that Guinness, the

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:26.949
company, Guinness the drink, no longer has anything to do really with Guinness World Records.

00:15:27.929 --> 00:15:32.699
The company itself changed hands several times, it was sold

00:15:32.729 --> 00:15:38.219
several times, but has kept the iconic name of Guinness.

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:44.829
So Guinness the drink gets all of this publicity every time

00:15:44.859 --> 00:15:49.389
someone says the name Guinness World Records, it gets it for free.

00:15:50.323 --> 00:15:54.093
It has certainly come a long way and has had an interesting

00:15:54.093 --> 00:15:59.738
history for a book that was written in 13 and a half weeks and meant to be

00:15:59.738 --> 00:16:04.869
given away for free and enjoyed over a cold pint of Guinness.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.160
Okay, then that is it for today's episode of English Learning for Curious Minds.

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.460
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:23.880
so please do write in, the email is hi H i@leonardoenglish.com.

00:16:25.012 --> 00:16:28.038
As I said at the start of this podcast, we

00:16:28.038 --> 00:16:31.668
have made a few changes to the way that the podcasts work.

00:16:32.058 --> 00:16:38.298
So if you want access to every single episode plus two new ones a week, then you

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:44.388
should head to the Leonardo English website and until May the 10th which is this

00:16:44.388 --> 00:16:50.178
coming Sunday, you can save 20% on the normal cost of our Listener membership with

00:16:50.178 --> 00:16:57.708
the code april4, A P R I L 4, so it's just four euros a month, 48 euros a year.

00:16:58.068 --> 00:17:02.508
But be quick as that only lasts until midnight on Sunday.

00:17:03.693 --> 00:17:08.083
The link to go to is Leonardoenglish.com/subscribe.

00:17:09.973 --> 00:17:14.383
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.

00:17:14.953 --> 00:17:20.713
I'm Alastair Budge, you stay safe and I will catch you in the next episode.

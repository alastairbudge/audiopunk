Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:17.154
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:17.164 --> 00:00:21.574
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:26.024
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:30.514
about Ferdinand Magellan & The First Voyage Around The World.

00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:40.584
On September 20th, 1519, five ships and 270 men set sail from southern Spain.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.164
Their aim?

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:47.844
To sail west and find a route through the Americas to the Spice

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:52.324
Islands, in modern day Indonesia, on the other side of the world.

00:00:53.184 --> 00:01:01.624
In all of history, no human had ever managed this before, and very few even thought it was possible.

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:12.294
1,381 days later, 18 of the 270 men returned to Spain, tired, hungry,

00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:17.564
full of disease, but becoming the first people to have successfully

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:22.539
circumnavigated the globe, to have done a complete circle of the Earth.

00:01:23.964 --> 00:01:28.874
This story, of the first voyage around the world, will involve national

00:01:28.874 --> 00:01:34.984
rivalries, ambitious kings, geopolitical divisions, religion, colonialism,

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:42.079
racism, pride, foolishness, terrible punishments, bravery, slavery, and more.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:49.424
It is quite the story, and as such, this episode is going to be a little longer than normal.

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.876
OK then, let’s get started.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:02:02.266
The late 15th and early 16th century was the height of the Age of Exploration, as

00:02:02.276 --> 00:02:09.896
European powers sought to explore the world and seize territory and riches for themselves.

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:19.226
Top of the list were India and south East Asia, in a large part because of their precious spices.

00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:27.366
The world’s two most powerful maritime powers, Spain and Portugal, were engaged in a competition

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:34.266
to see who could discover the first sea route, and claim these riches for themselves.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:39.809
Christopher Columbus, on the Spanish side, had sailed west and

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:45.189
accidentally discovered the Americas in 1492, while looking for India.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.642
Meanwhile, the Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:54.889
successfully managed to sail to India 6 years later, in 1498.

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:05.029
With the backdrop of this increasing rivalry, in 1494 Spain and Portugal had signed an agreement

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:12.349
called the Treaty of Tordesillas, which divided the world into two sections, East and West.

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:17.799
Imagine a map of the world, and draw a line straight down

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.379
the Atlantic, going through the eastern part of Brazil.

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.439
Any new lands discovered to the east of the line would be the property

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:32.599
of Portugal, and everything to the west would be the property of Spain.

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:37.889
The treaty was more like a guideline for behaviour between the two

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.579
countries, and wasn’t acknowledged by most other European powers, or of

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:47.279
course by any of the other nations that had been included in this division.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:55.669
The importance of it was that it allowed Portugal to sail east to India and to the Spice Islands,

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.599
which are in modern-day Indonesia, while for Spain to get there they would need to sail West.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.299
But there was one big problem here.

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:11.549
Nobody had ever sailed west to the Spice Islands, nobody

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.489
had ever sailed west all the way around the globe.

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:20.689
Christopher Columbus had sailed west and got to the Caribbean, he had discovered the Americas.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:29.269
Another Spanish explorer named Vasco Núñez de Balboa had discovered the Pacific Ocean in 1513,

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:36.219
after arriving in the Americas, making his way across Panama and seeing this huge stretch of water.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:44.169
On the other side of the Pacific Ocean, in East Asia, the Portuguese had done some exploring of

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:51.359
the Western Pacific, so they knew that the Pacific Ocean existed, it had been seen from both sides.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:05:00.269
But nobody knew firstly how to sail past the Americas, and secondly how far it was from the

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:07.859
west coast of America to the Spice Islands, essentially how large the Pacific Ocean was.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:14.119
Back in Europe, Charles V, the man who would later become Holy Roman Emperor,

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.769
had been crowned king of Spain in 1516, when he was just 16 years old.

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:27.649
Eager to make his mark, he was open to new ideas, he was willing to listen and

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.609
take risks, while an older, perhaps more established monarch, might not have been.

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:41.809
Sometime in late 1517 or early 1518, one such idea presented itself.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:48.131
It came from a man known in Spanish as Fernando de Magallanes,

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.569
but we will use his Anglicised name, Ferdinand Magellan.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.889
As regular listeners will know, usually we try to use the original

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.969
pronunciation, but in the case of Magellan, Magellanes isn’t even his real name.

00:06:04.609 --> 00:06:09.720
It's Fernão de Magalhães, because he wasn’t actually Spanish.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.250
He was Portuguese.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.940
Now, given what we know about the rivalry between Spain and

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.530
Portugal, why was a Spanish king listening to a Portuguese man?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.540
Well, much like the Italian, Christopher Columbus, who had discovered

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.810
the Americas on behalf of Spain, Magellan was more interested in

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.120
adventure and personal glory than allegiance to the country of his birth.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.220
He was born in 1480 to a minor aristocratic Portuguese family.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.270
After being orphaned, after losing both of his parents, when he was just 10 years old, he

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.580
served in the King of Portugal’s court, where he would have received a comprehensive education.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:05.030
At the first opportunity, he travelled east, and spent around 8 years

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:10.100
fighting colonial battles in the far East, as well as in north Africa.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.580
He was an accomplished, a very skilled soldier and

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.140
sailor, and showed a keen interest in exploration.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:25.580
The term most commonly used of him by historians is a “career-minded daredevil”,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.150
someone who is ready to embrace danger if it delivers him professional success.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.510
He was on the path to a successful career, and in 1511 he was appointed captain

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.620
of an expedition to the Molucca Islands, otherwise known as the Spice Islands.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.870
If you have listened to the episode on The Curious History of

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.130
Spice, you will know all about these islands, and their importance.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.890
At this time spices were in high demand back in Europe.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.180
They were used for cooking, but also for medicinal purposes.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:09.800
And they were incredibly expensive, with many worth more than their weight in gold

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.900
So Magellan, who would at this time still have gone by his Portuguese

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.500
name, Magalhães, was on the path to both career and financial success.

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:29.370
But sometime around 1514 he was accused of trading illegally with the Moroccans,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:35.890
and his promising career came to a sudden end, or at least, a sudden pause.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.460
By this time he had spent almost 10 years navigating the oceans, fighting and trading,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.640
and was an incredibly experienced soldier and sailor, with a deep knowledge of East Asia.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:58.650
He was also very interested, and increasingly knowledgeable in navigation, and became convinced

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:05.140
that it was possible to get to the Spice Islands from the east, that is sailing west from

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:11.710
Europe, across the Atlantic, and finding a way through the Americas to the Pacific Ocean.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.550
Since Christopher Columbus, around 500 different ships had

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:22.730
tried to find this navigable sea route, but none had managed.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:30.350
There were rumours that such a path existed, and even some maps that suggested where it was.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.290
But nobody had ever actually found it.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.800
What’s more, there were stories of sea monsters, terrible weather, and

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.780
all sorts of dangers that awaited any ship that went this far west.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.000
It was, in the literal sense of the term, uncharted territory.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:55.110
But Magellan was not the sort of person to be deterred by this.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.640
He tried to get the Portuguese King to support an expedition west, but he wasn’t interested.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.620
Firstly, Magellan was no longer in favour in his homeland,

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.630
after being accused of illegally trading with the Moroccans.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:18.960
Secondly, why would Portugal invest money in such an expedition, when the Portuguese already had

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:25.120
a very profitable route going east, and had already claimed the Spice Islands for themselves?

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:31.530
And thirdly, there was the treaty that divided the world in two, and Portugal

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:37.920
sailing west risked breaking the treaty and unnecessarily upsetting the Spanish.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.190
Magellan needed to find someone else who would be willing to support the mission.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.650
He left Portugal in 1517, arriving in Spain, and presented

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.320
his idea to the then 17-year-old Spanish king, Charles V.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:00.150
Not only did he propose to Charles that such a route existed, but he

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.960
also told him that he could prove that the Spice Islands were on the

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.920
Spanish side of the world, and thus they actually belonged to Spain.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.460
It was a case of right time, right person, right message.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.500
Charles agreed to pay for 5 ships and just short of 300 men.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.680
Magellan would lead this expedition, and if it were

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.420
successful he would become spectacularly wealthy.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.920
He put together a team of mainly Spanish sailors, and got ready to set sail.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:42.220
The sailors, however, weren’t told about the details of the trip.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:48.242
If they knew that they were going to what was then considered to be the end of the Earth,

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.170
going where no human had ever gone before, many would no doubt have refused to join.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:01.550
It was only after the ships set sail that the true nature of the trip was revealed.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.780
Almost from the outset, from the beginning of the trip, there was trouble.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:14.080
The majority Spanish sailors did not appreciate being under the leadership of a Portuguese captain.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.870
Although Magellan had been granted Spanish citizenship, and was undertaking

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.190
this mission on behalf of the Spanish king, he was still Portuguese.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.540
And the Portuguese king, when he found out what Magellan had done, was

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:34.580
furious, and sent Portuguese ships to follow Magellan as he sailed south.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:41.860
The Portuguese ships didn’t manage to catch up with them, so that problem was temporarily

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:47.900
resolved, but the animosity the Spanish sailors felt towards their captain certainly wasn’t.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:54.320
It took the five ships just short of three months to cross the Atlantic, finally

00:12:54.330 --> 00:13:01.270
arriving at a bay Magellan called Bahia de Santa Lucía on December 13th 1519.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:08.260
At that time it was a quiet, peaceful bay, but it’s now the location of the bustling

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:13.380
city of Rio de Janeiro, about halfway down the eastern coast of South America.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:21.527
As they sailed south, they explored every promising inlet, every passage inland,

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:27.050
to see whether it would lead them to the sea that they believed lay ahead.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:33.310
But time and time again, they would have to turn back around, as what

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.880
they had hoped would be a path through would be blocked by the land.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:45.620
Not only must it have been dispiriniting work, it was also dangerous - you never knew how

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:50.700
deep the water would be, what direction the currents would flow, and you had to remember

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.830
every turning you had taken, otherwise you wouldn’t be able to find your way back out.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:02.180
It took them another three and a half months to get to a place called Puerto San Julián, in

00:14:02.534 --> 00:14:08.850
Patagonia, almost at the tip of South America, but of course they weren’t to know that at the time.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:16.830
All they knew was that winter was soon approaching, the crew was tired, hungry and disillusioned.

00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:20.077
And they hated their Portuguese leader.

00:14:20.837 --> 00:14:28.190
There was a mutiny, much of the crew rose up against Magellan and demanded to return home to Spain.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.260
Three ships declared themselves independent of Magellan; they

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.510
declared that he no longer had control over the expedition.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.420
But Magellan was a cunning sailor and soldier.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.360
He tricked one of the mutinous captains, one of the rebellious captains,

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.770
into thinking that a messenger was coming on board to give him a letter.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:58.090
This messenger came onboard the ship, waited until he was next to the captain,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.580
pretended to give him a letter but then stabbed him, killing him outright.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:12.040
Magellan managed to subdue the other mutineers, and set off to punish the rebellious sailors.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.330
Two of the leaders were beheaded, their heads were chopped off, and

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.220
their bodies chopped up and put on sticks to be a warning to others.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:29.840
Another mutinous captain was left on an island with a mutinous priest, never to be heard from again.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:36.580
The message was clear - if you mess with Ferdinand Magellan, it will not end well.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:46.170
In October of 1520, Magellan got lucky, or rather his hard work and perseverance finally paid off.

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:52.670
He had sent one of the ships inland to investigate a promising passage.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:16:00.750
It returned with great news - they had gone through the other side, and found this promised sea.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.030
The remaining ships set sail, and made the crossing.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:10.660
As Magellan saw the sea, he named it Mar Pacifico, the

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.840
“still sea”, because of how still and calm it looked.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.970
Given what we know now about how rough the Pacific Ocean actually is, this might be

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.820
surprising, but it must have been a peaceful day when Magellan’s ships first saw it.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.500
By this time only three of the original five ships remained.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:39.260
One had sunk while exploring a passage, and another, the San Antonio,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.270
had taken the opportunity to turn back, to escape, and return to Spain.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.580
Nevertheless, the three ships continued west, sailing across the Pacific Ocean.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.430
Magellan had thought that the Pacific Ocean was quite small,

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.840
and had anticipated it would take them a few days to cross.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:06.270
It took almost four months for them to reach the Pacific island of Guam, which is

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:12.180
around 2,000 km east of the Philippines and 2,000 km north of Papua New Guinea.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:18.990
They were woefully unprepared for the size of the Pacific Ocean, and were reduced

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:26.630
to eating rats and maggots, those small white, worm-like animals used to catch fish.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.120
They had no fresh fruit or vegetables, and most of the men suffered terribly

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:39.220
from scurvy, the disease you get when you have a severe deficiency in Vitamin C.

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.170
19 of the men died on the trip across the ocean.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.810
Although there was no doubt a great sense of relief when they

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:53.270
finally saw land, their arrival at Guam wasn’t a peaceful one.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.580
The natives approached the boats, came onboard and took equipment.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.470
There was a struggle, and the European sailors killed one of the natives.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:09.420
As revenge for what Magellan considered to be an attack on his men, he

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.480
returned the day later burning housing and killing seven of the natives.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.860
Having taken fresh supplies of food and water, they continued their

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.550
journey westwards, and arrived at The Philippines a week later.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.470
Thankfully, they had better luck with the native people here than

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:33.500
in Guam, and this is in a large part due to a man called Enrique.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:38.870
Enrique, known as Enrique of Malacca, was a Malay man

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.650
who Magellan had bought as a slave 8 years beforehand.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.120
He accompanied Magellan everywhere, and although it was a

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.530
relationship of master and servant, the two had grown close.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.950
Enrique was able to speak to the native people in

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.060
Malay, and acted as translator for the Spanish party.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.750
They exchanged gifts, traded, and the Spaniards introduced Christianity to the

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:11.910
native people, many of whom, including the chief of an island called Cebu, converted.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:17.610
But one island, the island of Mactan, was not bowing down so easily.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.750
Its leader, a man called Lapu-Lapu, not only rejected the idea of

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.470
Spanish supremacy, but also refused to convert to Christianity.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:36.270
Mactan and Cebu were rival islands, and historians believe that the chief of Cebu, who

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:42.880
did convert to Christianity, persuaded Magellan to attack the island of Mactan, his rival.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.160
The Spaniards at this time numbered around 150.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:53.620
They were well-equipped, with guns, armour, and advanced weapons.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:58.070
The inhabitants of Mactan, on the other hand, were not.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.810
It should have been no contest.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.340
On the morning of 27th April 1521 Magellan attacked.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:13.420
He and a group of around 50 men sailed right up to the island, then got out

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.600
of the ships and advanced, walking through the water in their heavy armour.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:24.900
The natives had bows and arrows, but they just bounced off the Spanish armour.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:30.930
Magellan and his men arrived on the shore, and burned down some local houses.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.900
The idea was no doubt to scare the natives and get

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.600
them to surrender, but it had the opposite effect.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.870
A group of 1,500 natives rushed at them.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.340
They had noticed that the Spaniards had plenty of armour, plenty of

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.200
protection, on their upper bodies, but their legs were uncovered.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:01.280
They soon identified Magellan, and a poisoned arrow was shot into his upper leg.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.910
He fell to the ground, and within minutes a crowd of

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.230
natives had jumped on him and killed him with bamboo spears.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.670
His men retreated to their boats, leaving Magellan’s body to the Mactan people.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:23.800
It was a completely pointless, and utterly inglorious, death for Magellan.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:29.740
There was no need for him to attack Mactan, no need to get caught up in a

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:35.440
dispute between two island chiefs, and no need for him to risk everything

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.080
because he felt slightly offended, or because he wanted to do an ally a favour.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.000
But he did, and he paid for it with his life.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:54.061
By this time there were only 115 out of the 270 men who had left Spain a couple of years beforehand.

00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:59.721
This wasn’t enough men to manage three ships, so one was

00:21:59.721 --> 00:22:03.081
burnt and the other two pushed on to the Spice Islands.

00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:09.491
They had gone almost all the way, and they knew that if they could get there huge

00:22:09.511 --> 00:22:15.681
riches would await them, and they could turn the entire voyage into a profitable one.

00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:22.131
When they finally arrived there, they did manage to trade with the chief of one of the islands.

00:22:22.431 --> 00:22:27.061
They exchanged metals, cloths and glass for huge amounts

00:22:27.091 --> 00:22:31.861
of spices, particularly cloves, and set off back to Spain.

00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:35.681
Only one ship, The Victoria, would make it back.

00:22:36.331 --> 00:22:41.571
The other was badly damaged, and then captured by the Portuguese when it was being repaired.

00:22:42.704 --> 00:22:50.111
On 21st December 1521, two years and three months after it had set off from Spain,

00:22:50.271 --> 00:22:55.291
the one surviving ship, The Victoria, finally set off from the Spice Islands

00:22:55.601 --> 00:23:01.591
back to Spain, this time sailing westwards, around the tip of South Africa.

00:23:02.521 --> 00:23:08.541
And on September 5th 1522, eight and a half months after it

00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:12.791
had left the Spice Islands, it finally arrived back in Spain.

00:23:13.651 --> 00:23:19.966
The return trip had cost the lives of twenty-two of the crew members, who had died of starvation.

00:23:20.904 --> 00:23:26.034
And of the initial 270 men who had left on the adventure,

00:23:26.294 --> 00:23:30.524
only 18 were on the Victoria when it finally pulled into port.

00:23:31.594 --> 00:23:32.894
Quite the trip.

00:23:33.434 --> 00:23:37.454
In terms of the legacy of this expedition, it has of course gone down

00:23:37.524 --> 00:23:41.864
in history, and has been called  "the greatest sea voyage in the Age

00:23:41.864 --> 00:23:46.467
of Discovery" and "the most important maritime voyage ever undertaken".

00:23:47.394 --> 00:23:50.174
In many respects, it was a great success.

00:23:50.344 --> 00:23:56.124
A sea route from east to west was discovered, it enabled a greater understanding of other

00:23:56.124 --> 00:24:01.844
peoples and cultures, an understanding of maritime navigation and an interest in exploration.

00:24:02.354 --> 00:24:08.274
It also more than paid for its cost, as it came back filled with precious spices.

00:24:08.854 --> 00:24:13.814
And on a linguistic note, from it came the first known phrasebook of

00:24:13.814 --> 00:24:17.974
native languages, languages the sailors discovered on their voyage.

00:24:18.894 --> 00:24:23.754
This was written by the Italian scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who was one

00:24:23.764 --> 00:24:28.884
of the 18 men to return on The Victoria, and documented the entire trip.

00:24:29.554 --> 00:24:32.404
But in other respects, it was a failure.

00:24:32.894 --> 00:24:39.334
The intention was to find another commercial route to the Spice Islands, but the route across the

00:24:39.334 --> 00:24:46.104
Pacific proved to not be profitable - it was too long and too dangerous to make commercial sense.

00:24:47.064 --> 00:24:53.184
And in terms of the legacy of Magellan, yes he was clearly a brilliant and brave adventurer,

00:24:53.324 --> 00:24:59.554
sailor and navigator, but he was deeply unpopular with his men, got needlessly caught up

00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:05.564
in a tribal dispute, and ultimately never made it all the way around the world in one trip.

00:25:06.744 --> 00:25:12.004
So, while some people might know Magellan as the first person to sail

00:25:12.004 --> 00:25:16.464
around the world, technically he never actually got the whole way around.

00:25:17.534 --> 00:25:21.744
If that’s right, who was the first person to sail around the world?

00:25:22.384 --> 00:25:28.554
Well, this is where things get tricky, and there isn’t complete agreement between historians.

00:25:29.114 --> 00:25:30.154
It wasn’t Magellan.

00:25:30.534 --> 00:25:35.034
Yes, he was the person who was responsible for the expedition, and it

00:25:35.044 --> 00:25:39.654
wouldn’t have happened without him, but he died before the mission was over.

00:25:40.794 --> 00:25:46.914
It might have been one of the original men who set sail from Spain and returned, almost three

00:25:46.914 --> 00:25:53.222
years later, such as the captain of the Victoria after Magellan’s death, Juan Sebastian Elcano.

00:25:53.964 --> 00:25:58.249
It could, however have been Enrique, the Malay slave, who was

00:25:58.249 --> 00:26:01.769
left behind by the Spaniards as they left the Philippines.

00:26:02.609 --> 00:26:09.965
As a young boy he had been bought by Magellan and taken back west to Spain, so if he ever managed

00:26:09.995 --> 00:26:15.815
to get back to his homeland in Malacca, which was only a few hundred kilometres from where he was

00:26:15.815 --> 00:26:21.885
last seen, he would be the first person to have gone around the world, albeit in multiple trips.

00:26:22.405 --> 00:26:26.945
But nobody, at least in the European world, heard of him ever after.

00:26:27.665 --> 00:26:33.260
So, while we know the amazing story of the first trip around the world, and we know that

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:39.765
the first person to do it was on the ship that left Spain 502 years ago this month, we will

00:26:39.765 --> 00:26:46.315
never know for sure the identity of the first person to go all the way around the world.

00:26:48.863 --> 00:26:53.615
Ok then, there you have it, the story of the first voyage around

00:26:53.615 --> 00:26:57.615
the world, and of its daredevil captain, Ferdinand Magellan.

00:26:58.425 --> 00:27:00.925
As always, I would love to know what you thought of

00:27:00.925 --> 00:27:03.965
this episode, and of the story of Ferdinand Magellan.

00:27:04.285 --> 00:27:08.975
We have lots of listeners from the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking worlds,

00:27:09.025 --> 00:27:13.605
both old and new, so I would particularly like to get your take on it.

00:27:14.475 --> 00:27:15.885
Was Magellan a hero?

00:27:16.215 --> 00:27:19.845
How would history remember him differently if he hadn’t died?

00:27:20.315 --> 00:27:26.085
How is he remembered in Spain, and in Portugal, and in your country, wherever that might be?

00:27:26.445 --> 00:27:27.775
I would love to know.

00:27:27.985 --> 00:27:30.105

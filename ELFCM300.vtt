Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.860
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.850
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.420
I’m Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking about plastic.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.050
Plastic is clearly everywhere in modern life.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.180
It seems that everything we unwrap, unbox or throw away today comes with plastic,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.510
with the average person in Europe getting through a kilo of plastic every single week.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.913
But, no matter how much plastic we use, the good news is that if we are good

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:52.253
citizens and put it in a recycling bin it will magically be turned into new plastic.

00:00:53.076 --> 00:00:53.503
Or will it?

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:58.413
In this episode we are going to look at recycling plastic, and

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:02.333
ask the perhaps heretical question – “does it really work?”

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.663
Ok then, plastic.

00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:09.943
Today we use plastic in just about everything.

00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:16.993
Toys, technology, cars, appliances and even building materials all contain plastic.

00:01:17.763 --> 00:01:22.353
The device you’re listening to this on is made possible thanks to plastic.

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:28.683
Globally we produce over 380 million tonnes of plastic every year.

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:32.982
In 1950, this number was just 2 million.

00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:36.663
And over a quarter of that is packaging.

00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:42.613
The UK alone gets through 7.7 billion water bottles

00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:46.523
every year – that’s around 150 bottles per person!

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:53.193
Globally there are an estimated 500 billion plastic water bottles used worldwide.

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:58.923
And this is just water bottles - perhaps one of the most visible uses of plastic

00:01:58.943 --> 00:02:04.233
but only representing a tiny fraction of the total plastic used worldwide.

00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:10.523
And plastic, over the past few years, has got a lot of negative media attention.

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:15.463
It is thrown into our rivers and oceans, kills fish and birds,

00:02:15.523 --> 00:02:19.793
and ends up polluting the wonderful, beautiful world we live in.

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:24.203
There are a few different schools of thoughts about what should

00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:27.643
be done about this, or at least elements to the discussion.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.873
Firstly, that it’s the job of governments to better educate

00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:36.923
people about recycling, to simply get people to recycle more.

00:02:38.113 --> 00:02:43.623
You may be aware that only 9% of all plastic ever made has been recycled,

00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:48.823
so we simply aren’t very good at recycling, despite the fact that in much of

00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:52.973
the Western world at least we have been taught to recycle for decades now.

00:02:54.193 --> 00:03:00.033
Secondly, that we need to use less plastic and find more sustainable options.

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:08.113
Instead of plastic bags we should use paper bags, instead of plastic bottles we use glass and so on.

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:14.583
Thirdly, that we need to get better at reusing, that if we simply reuse the

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:19.776
plastic that has already been created, the levels of plastic created would reduce.

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:26.816
And fourthly, there’s a larger category of placing an increased focus on technological

00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:33.048
developments to both improve recycling processes and create alternatives to plastic.

00:03:34.308 --> 00:03:39.245
In this episode we’ll touch on all of these four different categories, but first

00:03:39.245 --> 00:03:45.035
off, let’s remind ourselves of what plastic actually is, and where it comes from.

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:49.945
We tend to think of plastic as a pretty modern material.

00:03:50.282 --> 00:03:56.082
So you might be surprised to find out that it was actually invented in the 19th century.

00:03:57.022 --> 00:04:04.542
Yes, the first plastic - something called Parkesine - appeared way back in 1862, 160 years ago.

00:04:06.002 --> 00:04:11.722
In the 1920s and 30s, the first modern plastic, Bakelite, came along.

00:04:12.382 --> 00:04:17.172
It was heat resistant, durable and insulating, Bakelite

00:04:17.182 --> 00:04:21.072
was used in everything from telephones to light switches.

00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:25.902
But plastic really came into its own in the second half

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.952
of the 20th century, 100 years after its first appearance.

00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:37.442
As plastic became cheaper and easier to produce, it increasingly replaced older,

00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:42.652
more expensive materials, such as metal and glass – especially in packaging.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:48.992
In the 1960s, the now ubiquitous plastic bag started to make

00:04:48.992 --> 00:04:52.842
its way into shops, ushering in the true age of plastic.

00:04:54.162 --> 00:05:01.372
And although it’s frequently bashed, criticised by a lot of environmental campaigners, it

00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:08.372
would be shortsighted and negligent not to take a minute to underline how much plastic has

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:14.942
revolutionised modern life, with some people even dubbing the modern era as “The Plastic Age”.

00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:20.732
Unlike glass, plastic is light and hard to break – making it

00:05:20.732 --> 00:05:24.512
easier and safer to transport items in plastic containers.

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:30.772
It doesn’t break down or decompose, meaning it’s hard-wearing and long-lasting.

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:38.492
These properties have allowed us to make huge advances in medicine, food production and technology.

00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:44.961
It’s no exaggeration to say that every aspect of our lives would be different without plastic.

00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:48.121
Take food production, for example.

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:54.571
Plastic is often a villain of the food industry, because of how much single-use plastic is

00:05:54.581 --> 00:06:00.501
used in food packaging, but there are many ways in which it actually helps reduce food waste.

00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:06.101
Plastic packaging means produce can be sealed – keeping it fresh for longer,

00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:11.011
and giving us a wider choice of fresh products on the shelves than ever before.

00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:18.761
Vacuum packaging protects food, slowing decomposition and giving food a longer shelf life.

00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:26.191
A study from 2011, for example, showed that the just 2g of plastic that

00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:31.171
is wrapped around a cucumber extends its shelf life by up to 60 per

00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:36.211
cent – simply by preventing the cucumber from losing water and drying out.

00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:42.771
Without plastic packaging, much of our food would go bad before it even reached the shops.

00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:48.721
In fact, a Swiss study suggested that the environmental benefit that

00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:52.991
wrapping cucumbers in plastic has on reducing food waste is almost

00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:57.211
5 times higher than the negative impact of producing the packaging.

00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:02.131
All these benefits are created by just a tiny amount of plastic.

00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:05.781
And of course it’s not just food production.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.631
Plastic’s insulating properties have given us huge advances in building and

00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:16.851
heating materials, helping to keep our homes warmer and reduce use of fossil fuels.

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:21.551
Plastic has also revolutionised healthcare, allowing us to create

00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:27.161
single use items such as gloves and syringes, which make medicine safer.

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:33.801
It’s sterile and hypo-allergenic, and its inherent flexibility has led to all

00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:39.151
kinds of innovations in medical devices, from pacemakers to blister packs.

00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:43.401
It has even made driving safer – plastic is used in

00:07:43.657 --> 00:07:47.541
airbags, bumpers and seat belts to name just a few.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:54.321
And then there’s the environmental and economic benefit of transporting goods in plastic packaging.

00:07:55.271 --> 00:08:00.121
Because it’s so lightweight, transporting plastic uses less fuel

00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:04.661
than other materials, meaning lower energy use and fewer emissions.

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:10.181
For example, a glass yoghurt pot weighs around 85 grams.

00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:14.321
But a plastic one only weighs 5.5 grams.

00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:20.891
So, once you’ve loaded your yoghurt into the truck, the glass jars – the packaging – takes

00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:25.421
up over a third of your total weight if we’re talking about a small pot of yoghurt.

00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:29.631
For plastic pots it’s less than four per cent!

00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:35.251
This means you need more trucks – and more fuel – to transport the glass pots.

00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:41.951
Now, based simply on how cheap, durable, lightweight, and hygienic plastic

00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:47.691
is, an alien arriving on planet Earth might ask “so, what’s the problem then?”

00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.491
Well, it’s precisely the properties that make plastic so useful

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:56.171
that also become its biggest problems after we’ve finished with it.

00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:02.951
It’s so cheap to make, meaning it’s economically acceptable to use it once and then throw it away.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:10.300
Given that only 9% of plastic is ever recycled, the vast majority of it ends up in landfills.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:16.500
And once it’s in a landfill, one of its biggest benefits becomes its biggest problem.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:23.310
It is so hard-wearing and durable that it can take hundreds of years to decompose.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.830
And when it does start to decompose, well that’s not good news either.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:37.040
Plastics break down into tiny, microscopic particles, known as microplastics, as they decompose.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.670
This may not sound like such a bad thing, but these particles

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.970
can get into our environment, and particularly into the oceans.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:51.290
They are then ingested by fish and marine animals, making their way through our

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.730
ecosystems and even into the human food chain when we eat these fish and animals.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:03.490
It’s estimated that a staggering 90% of seabirds now have plastic in their stomachs.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.540
And a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation claimed that at least eight

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.260
million tonnes of plastics are leaked into the ocean every year – that's

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.610
the equivalent of tipping a rubbish truck into the sea every minute.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.520
In fact it is predicted that by the year 2050 there

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.910
will be, by weight, more plastic in the sea than fish!

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.030
Now, we don’t really know the effect that these microplastics might have on our

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.690
bodies, but there is growing concern that they could be causing serious damage.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:45.385
So, plastic, whilst being cheap, durable and flexible, is also non-biodegradable,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.880
takes millennia to break down and pollutes our land and oceans.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.590
But there is a solution, I hear you saying.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.480
Recycling.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.020
It sounds like a brilliant solution.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.100
We get all of the benefits of using plastic without the environmental pollution.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.050
Except, of course, it’s not quite that simple.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.220
Firstly, getting people to actually recycle is really hard.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:17.000
Governments have been telling people to “reduce, reuse and recycle” for

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:23.530
over 40 years, but still only 9% of plastic is actually recycled globally.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:31.240
Yes, some countries are better, others are worse, but even doubling the global recycling rate would

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:37.030
still mean that four out of five pieces of plastic produced worldwide would never be recycled.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.640
And this is before we get to the question of plastic recycling itself.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:48.730
There is an environmental cost to everything, and recycling is no exception.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:55.323
And when it comes to recycling plastic, this cost is not insignificant, and

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:00.240
in some cases it can be higher than simply producing the plastic from scratch.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.060
Perhaps it’s useful to think about the process of recycling

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.940
something, a plastic bottle, let’s say, to illustrate this.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.430
After I’m finished with the bottle of water, I see a

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.198
recycling bin and think “great, I’ll just chuck it in there”.

00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:23.628
Someone needs to come in a truck to collect it, take it to be sorted, it needs to be put

00:12:23.628 --> 00:12:29.588
together with other similar plastics, because not all plastics can be recycled together, then

00:12:29.718 --> 00:12:35.588
it will probably be taken on a large ship, transported often thousands of kilometres away,

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:41.508
where it will be melted down at high temperatures, to be turned into small plastic pellets,

00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:47.938
which will only then be resold to plastic plants, who will melt it again to make another bottle.

00:12:49.048 --> 00:12:55.468
As we see, there is a non-zero environmental cost to this kind of circular economy.

00:12:56.468 --> 00:13:01.468
And this is not to say that this isn’t a cost worth paying, but rather

00:13:01.468 --> 00:13:05.918
to illustrate that recycling alone isn’t without its environmental cost.

00:13:07.178 --> 00:13:09.108
So, what is the answer then?

00:13:09.698 --> 00:13:13.678
Well, one theory has it that we should use plastic alternatives.

00:13:14.048 --> 00:13:17.288
Instead of plastic bottles, we use glass bottles.

00:13:17.558 --> 00:13:20.818
Instead of plastic bags, we use cotton bags.

00:13:21.988 --> 00:13:25.573
This might result in less plastic in the oceans, but

00:13:25.853 --> 00:13:29.333
neither of these options are ideal environmentally.

00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:36.473
There’s an excellent TED talk about this by a Danish professor called Kim Ragaert, where

00:13:36.593 --> 00:13:41.763
she explains in detail how to think about plastic as an alternative to these options.

00:13:42.923 --> 00:13:47.833
In the case of glass bottles, she explains that glass bottles can be twice

00:13:47.983 --> 00:13:52.553
as heavy as plastic, meaning the transport costs of the packaging is double.

00:13:53.643 --> 00:13:59.493
You can reuse glass bottles for liquids, but after the glass has been used 8 times

00:13:59.653 --> 00:14:05.783
it needs to be recycled, and because glass melts at 1,500 degrees Centigrade,

00:14:06.173 --> 00:14:11.423
the recycling process of glass takes a lot more energy than recycling plastic.

00:14:12.883 --> 00:14:18.643
Similarly, with the plastic versus cotton bag debate, because you need so much cotton to create

00:14:18.663 --> 00:14:25.713
a bag, and it is such a thirsty crop, it requires so much water, you would need to reuse a

00:14:25.713 --> 00:14:33.023
cotton bag 173 times for it to have a lower environmental impact than a single plastic bag.

00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:40.043
To put it another way, if you reused one of those simple plastic bags for a month

00:14:40.353 --> 00:14:46.593
it would have the same environmental cost as using the same cotton bag for 15 years.

00:14:47.973 --> 00:14:52.453
As you’re probably seeing now, one of the most effective ways to reduce

00:14:52.453 --> 00:14:57.713
the environmental use of plastic is to reduce your use of plastic and reuse

00:14:57.793 --> 00:15:02.433
the plastic you do use, not to rely on recycling to do the work for us.

00:15:03.323 --> 00:15:08.413
This is, of course, not to say that recycling is pointless or that it isn’t

00:15:08.423 --> 00:15:13.163
worth it, but that it should be complemented with reducing and reusing.

00:15:14.443 --> 00:15:16.983
In many cases, this is easy to do.

00:15:17.473 --> 00:15:22.553
Instead of buying plastic bottles, reuse old plastic bottles or use

00:15:22.553 --> 00:15:26.043
a water filter instead of buying plastic bottles in the first place.

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:32.663
But clearly, reusing or not using plastic in the first place isn’t always an option.

00:15:33.393 --> 00:15:38.223
Healthcare is an obvious example, but there are situations where even the

00:15:38.223 --> 00:15:42.993
most devoted anti-plastic campaigner may well admit that the alternatives are

00:15:43.243 --> 00:15:48.213
considerably worse, and criticism of plastic isn’t actually all that helpful.

00:15:49.273 --> 00:15:54.103
Plastic straws, for example, are a frequent object of government criticism,

00:15:54.293 --> 00:15:58.143
and multiple cities and countries across the world have banned them.

00:15:59.423 --> 00:16:05.053
Sure, plastic straws are very visible, there were an estimated 500 million

00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:10.113
plastic straws used every single day in the United States alone, and they are

00:16:10.143 --> 00:16:15.063
technically unnecessary because it’s perfectly possible to drink without a straw.

00:16:16.223 --> 00:16:22.423
But focussing attention on plastic straws is a distraction, so some critics say.

00:16:23.813 --> 00:16:30.093
Plastic straws make up just 0.025% of all of the plastic that goes into

00:16:30.113 --> 00:16:35.663
the ocean, and even if plastic straws were banned forever and every single

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:39.883
plastic straw that had been washed into the oceans throughout history was

00:16:39.893 --> 00:16:44.923
magically removed, it still wouldn’t account for 1% of plastic pollution.

00:16:46.403 --> 00:16:50.013
Put simply, the impact of plastic straws on environmental

00:16:50.013 --> 00:16:53.443
pollution is absolutely miniscule, it's tiny.

00:16:54.303 --> 00:16:59.673
This doesn’t mean that plastic straws are good, not at all, but rather that

00:16:59.673 --> 00:17:04.173
instead of focusing our attention and effort on things like plastic straw use,

00:17:04.433 --> 00:17:08.773
a renewed focus should be put on things that will actually have an impact.

00:17:09.593 --> 00:17:14.273
So, if you’re waiting for the punchline, what are the things that actually

00:17:14.273 --> 00:17:18.423
matter, according to environmental campaigners against plastic pollution?

00:17:19.223 --> 00:17:21.013
Well, you likely know them already.

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:27.733
Whether it’s Greenpeace or the World Wildlife Fund, the main recommendations all revolve around

00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:33.623
choosing non-plastic where the option exists, and reusing the plastic that you already use.

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:40.823
But there is another category of recommendation, and this is specifically around plastic recycling.

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:47.283
If you are going to recycle, which of course you should do, make sure that you do it properly.

00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:52.483
One of the biggest problems with plastic recycling is stuff being put

00:17:52.503 --> 00:17:56.713
in the recycling bin that shouldn’t be there, leading to contamination.

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:03.833
And this doesn’t just mean contamination of your recycling, but all of the other recycling that’s

00:18:03.843 --> 00:18:09.863
in the batch with it, so the importance of actually recycling properly cannot be understated.

00:18:10.823 --> 00:18:16.513
As the saying goes in the UK, “if in doubt, leave it out”, meaning if you don’t know

00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:20.793
whether something can be recycled, just put it in the normal rubbish bin instead.

00:18:22.033 --> 00:18:28.083
Now, plastic is clearly a very useful material for almost everything, and we have an

00:18:28.093 --> 00:18:33.693
almost 50-year history of trying to get people to recycle it, with quite limited success.

00:18:34.633 --> 00:18:39.233
But what if there were a way to have some of the evident convenience of single-use

00:18:39.233 --> 00:18:43.573
plastic without the environmental problems that our current usage brings?

00:18:44.393 --> 00:18:47.936
Well, one possibility is something called bioplastics.

00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:53.583
These are plastics that are made from natural materials, such as corn

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:58.573
starch or sugar cane, and are often designed to decompose easily.

00:18:59.623 --> 00:19:06.253
Unlike conventional plastics, bioplastics don’t rely on fossil fuels, such as oil, for production.

00:19:07.103 --> 00:19:12.453
They can often be composted – but usually only in special industrial facilities.

00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:16.723
Other types still need to be recycled, which takes us

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:19.783
back to the same issues we have with regular plastic.

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.953
Now, bioplastics are still fairly new, and currently

00:19:23.953 --> 00:19:26.753
make up less than 1 percent of total plastic production.

00:19:27.393 --> 00:19:32.503
So, bioplastics are a work in progress, and the jury is still out

00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:35.933
on whether they will be part of the answer to our plastic problem.

00:19:37.023 --> 00:19:39.963
So, what about improving plastic recycling?

00:19:40.373 --> 00:19:43.853
Well, a new type of process called ‘chemical recycling’

00:19:44.163 --> 00:19:46.863
could change the way we deal with our plastic waste.

00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:53.153
The way we recycle plastic at the moment, mechanically, means that the actual

00:19:53.163 --> 00:19:57.603
structure of the plastic doesn’t change when it goes through the recycling process.

00:19:58.643 --> 00:20:03.073
With chemical recycling, plastic is broken down into its chemical

00:20:03.073 --> 00:20:07.173
components – its building blocks – before being made into new material.

00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:13.183
In theory, the benefit of chemical recycling is that plastics don’t

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:17.123
have to be sorted into different types in the same way as they do today.

00:20:18.403 --> 00:20:23.173
That means more recycling and less waste, but there’s still the same issue of

00:20:23.173 --> 00:20:27.913
persuading people to actually put their plastic in the recycling bin in the first place.

00:20:29.193 --> 00:20:32.343
Again, the jury is still out on chemical recycling.

00:20:33.633 --> 00:20:38.163
So, to wrap up this episode, we started with a heretical

00:20:38.163 --> 00:20:41.373
question, “does plastic recycling really work?”

00:20:42.553 --> 00:20:43.683
And what’s the answer?

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:49.223
It’s that yes, it can work structurally, the actual mechanism

00:20:49.223 --> 00:20:53.143
of recycling works, we can turn plastic into new plastic.

00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:59.783
But human beings, all 8 billion of us, are not nearly as good at recycling

00:20:59.783 --> 00:21:04.553
our plastic as we should be, and often our priorities are misplaced.

00:21:05.593 --> 00:21:10.233
The reality is that plastic is an incredibly useful invention, used

00:21:10.233 --> 00:21:14.523
in practically every aspect of modern life, and that simply getting

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:18.703
rid of plastic, without having an alternative, is not a viable option.

00:21:20.003 --> 00:21:24.525
So, while we continue to dump 8 million metric tonnes of plastic into the

00:21:24.525 --> 00:21:28.865
oceans every year and we aren’t getting much better at recycling it, it

00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:33.465
seems like The Plastic Age is going to continue for quite a while longer.

00:21:35.255 --> 00:21:39.687
OK then, that is it for today's episode on Plastic Recycling.

00:21:40.077 --> 00:21:43.207

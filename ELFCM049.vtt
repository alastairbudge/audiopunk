Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:15.009
Minds by Leonardo English, the show where you can learn fascinating things about the

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.009
world and listen to interesting stories at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.669
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about 'Fairtrade'.

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.459
You are probably familiar with the term, and you I'm sure would recognise

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:38.649
the logo, but do you know what it really means, how

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.289
it works and why some people think it doesn't actually work that well?

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.979
That is what today's episode is all about.

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.389
It has been a really interesting one to make and I can't wait to share it with you.

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.869
Before we get started though, I just wanted to remind you that you can get a copy of

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:06.299
the transcript and key vocabulary over on the website, which is Leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:12.484
The transcript means that you can follow along with every word, and the key vocabulary

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:18.394
means that you can build up your vocabulary at the same time as listening to the podcast.

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:23.314
So go and check that out, it is at leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:28.564
Okay then let's talk about Fairtrade.

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:35.044
When you hear the term Fairtrade, there are probably lots of things that come to mind.

00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:41.884
It might conjure up positive images, happy farmers in countries you might

00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:47.204
never have been to producing things like bananas, coffee or chocolate.

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:55.504
And for a lot of people it is a feel-good purchase if you are in a supermarket choosing

00:01:55.504 --> 00:02:02.344
between two different products and one has that familiar Fairtrade logo on and the

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:07.045
other doesn't, well, you might just go for the Fairtrade one because

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:12.620
it's not that much more expensive and Fairtrade must be a good thing, right?

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.860
But things aren't always quite as simple as they

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.710
seem, and Fairtrade isn't without its own fair share of critics.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.480
Before we talk about some of the criticisms of Fairtrade, it is

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.370
important to understand what exactly it is, how it came into existence and how it works.

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:42.118
Let's start with quickly talking about the history of

00:02:42.118 --> 00:02:47.466
trade and why there was a push towards making it fairer.

00:02:48.606 --> 00:02:50.106
It's quite simple, really.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:55.896
History shows us that trade was often very, very unfair.

00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:03.231
From slavery to colonial exploitation by European powers, history

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:09.741
is unfortunately filled with instances of the benefits of work and

00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:15.261
of farming not being felt by the people who actually do the work.

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:22.311
Of farmers and producers of the goods not being paid very much at all for what they

00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:29.286
produce, so that they live a precarious existence hovering around the poverty line.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.639
And even into the 20th century when demand for certain goods

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:41.279
increased as the world became more global, the price of certain products

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.979
was very volatile, it moved up and down dramatically and often.

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:51.894
When the price was high, things were just about okay.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.644
But when the price dropped, which it often

00:03:55.644 --> 00:04:00.834
does with things like coffee, farmers, the people who produced

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:06.504
the goods for the world to consume, they tended to get a pretty bad deal.

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.659
Farmers were paid such small amounts of money that they couldn't lift themselves out

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.589
of poverty, and they were often bullied and pressurised by large buyers

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:28.209
to accept lower prices because the small farmers had little or no negotiating power,

00:04:29.214 --> 00:04:34.884
and they weren't really aware of the true value of the goods that they were producing.

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:42.834
As the world continued to get more and more globalised and people in more developed

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:48.794
countries got used to things like coffee, bananas, and chocolate being things that

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:56.444
they could buy easily and cheaply, the people who produced these goods got paid less and less.

00:04:57.383 --> 00:05:05.603
And for years it sort of seemed like a inevitability of the economic system if

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:13.613
you want cheap bananas, cheap chocolate, cheap tea, cheap coffee or whatever it was, then it was

00:05:13.673 --> 00:05:21.263
an unfortunate reality that someone somewhere needed to be paid very little to produce it for you.

00:05:22.082 --> 00:05:24.372
Or worse, actually, people just

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:28.542
didn't really think about where these goods came from.

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:31.362
A banana came from somewhere.

00:05:31.422 --> 00:05:33.162
Chocolate came from somewhere else.

00:05:33.462 --> 00:05:40.122
There wasn't that much thought put towards the people who actually produced these goods.

00:05:42.282 --> 00:05:47.262
But towards the end of the 20th century, things started to change.

00:05:48.777 --> 00:05:56.667
The concept of Fairtrade has been around for quite a while, but the Fairtrade movement

00:05:56.817 --> 00:06:04.667
only started in 1988 in the Netherlands with a coffee label called Max Havelaar.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.700
I mention the name because it has quite an interesting story.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:18.800
Max Havelaar was the name of an anti-colonial novel from 1860 which described

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:25.190
the terrible treatment of the locals in Indonesia at the hands of the Dutch

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.320
where the local people were forced to produce sugar and coffee

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:36.815
for export back to Europe, as opposed to producing food for their families.

00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:44.015
The Dutch fixed the prices and the local farmers were forced to sell their

00:06:44.015 --> 00:06:50.765
produce to their colonial maÂ§sters for a tiny sum, barely enough to survive.

00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:56.735
All the profits went to the trading company, and the farmers

00:06:56.735 --> 00:07:01.978
were in effective slavery to their so-called trading partners.

00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:09.678
So the first ethical Fairtrade coffee was named after this book, Max Havelaar.

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:12.788
And it was a huge success, the coffee.

00:07:13.845 --> 00:07:20.265
Max Havelaar coffee paid its farmers more than the market price, more than

00:07:20.265 --> 00:07:25.935
the standard price they would get in the market, and importantly, it guaranteed the price.

00:07:27.165 --> 00:07:32.055
This was shown to be very important because the year after

00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:37.575
Max Havelaar launched coffee prices around the world crashed.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:45.420
Lots of coffee farmers had to sell their coffee for very low prices, too

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.110
low to make a proper living, and it became clear to the world that a fairer

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.390
system, similar to the one proposed by Max Havelaar coffee was needed.

00:07:58.543 --> 00:08:05.163
So in the years after this, in the early 1990s various groups came together,

00:08:05.319 --> 00:08:11.199
uniting around the mission to make trade fairer for farmers across the world.

00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:18.549
To try to ensure that they were paid a fair price for the goods that they were

00:08:18.549 --> 00:08:25.189
producing and to ensure that the profits from the work that they were doing were

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:31.929
going to them, to the farmers, and not to the middleman or large trading companies

00:08:31.929 --> 00:08:36.759
that bought the products from the farmers and then sold them in the developed world.

00:08:38.408 --> 00:08:41.361
We aren't going to go into huge detail in this

00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:47.061
episode about how Fairtrade is structured, but it is now a collection

00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:52.251
of different organisations that span large parts of the world.

00:08:53.357 --> 00:08:59.493
And since the Fairtrade foundation was established in 1992, it

00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:06.538
has grown to over 1.7 million farmers in 75 countries producing

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:13.738
30,000 different products, all united around a common mission, a common goal.

00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:19.268
And the mission of Fairtrade is pretty simple.

00:09:20.356 --> 00:09:24.716
In Fairtrade's own words, Fairtrade is about better

00:09:24.716 --> 00:09:30.146
prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability

00:09:30.746 --> 00:09:36.176
and fair terms of trade for farmers and workers in the developing world.

00:09:37.505 --> 00:09:44.915
How Fairtrade tries to achieve its mission is also pretty simple, on one level.

00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:51.793
It is all structured around the economist's favourite incentive: price.

00:09:53.164 --> 00:09:56.339
Firstly, there is a minimum price that a

00:09:56.339 --> 00:10:01.769
Fairtrade farmer gets, for the products that he or she sells.

00:10:02.969 --> 00:10:08.579
This means that, even in times when the price of something might go very low,

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:14.699
that farmer still receives the minimum price for the goods that they sell.

00:10:16.156 --> 00:10:19.808
This means that they can invest for the long-term and they

00:10:19.808 --> 00:10:26.138
don't have to constantly worry about fluctuations in the global price for their products,

00:10:26.648 --> 00:10:32.513
which as we have already mentioned, does happen a lot, there are a lot of fluctuations.

00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:37.004
Secondly, there is something called a Fairtrade

00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:42.034
premium that is paid to the cooperative that the farmer belongs to,

00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:45.864
so premium means an extra price, a higher price.

00:10:46.662 --> 00:10:51.312
The members of the cooperative can choose how this money

00:10:51.312 --> 00:10:57.822
is spent, but it has to be invested in business or community projects.

00:10:59.226 --> 00:11:03.366
That might be building a new well for water, a school

00:11:03.366 --> 00:11:08.506
for the children, a hospital or just buying better farming equipment.

00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:15.681
What this means is that the farmers who sell through Fairtrade are

00:11:15.681 --> 00:11:22.161
guaranteed a more stable income and they can invest in their farms, and it gives

00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:28.101
them a chance to provide a better, more stable future for them and their family.

00:11:29.194 --> 00:11:34.113
These higher prices for Fairtrade are paid ultimately

00:11:34.113 --> 00:11:40.863
by consumers, by you, by me, by the people who are choosing the banana,

00:11:40.893 --> 00:11:45.363
the chocolate bar, the tea, or the coffee with the Fairtrade logo.

00:11:47.403 --> 00:11:50.943
And as you probably know, the price difference between

00:11:51.213 --> 00:11:56.043
non-Fairtrade and Fairtrade is often not very large.

00:11:57.153 --> 00:12:01.953
So you can pay a little more for your products and feel

00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:05.313
that you are supporting a farmer and an honourable mission.

00:12:06.036 --> 00:12:09.156
The farmer gets paid fairly, you get to feel that you

00:12:09.156 --> 00:12:14.166
are making an ethical purchase and you feel better about yourself, and

00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:19.196
there is a stamp from Fairtrade, so maybe it even tastes better too.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:21.516
Everyone's a winner, right?

00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:24.396
What could possibly be the issue with this?

00:12:25.153 --> 00:12:29.070
Well, it isn't always as rosy as it seems.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.210
And while I don't think anyone is disagreeing with the fact that farmers should be paid

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:42.480
a fair rate for their work and that everyone should have a sustainable future, there

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:49.470
are those that say that Fairtrade actually isn't a very effective way to achieve this.

00:12:50.846 --> 00:12:57.086
Firstly, there is the complaint that it doesn't actually help that much.

00:12:58.346 --> 00:13:03.656
There is a cost for the farmers to achieve the Fairtrade certification,

00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:09.836
both a bureaucratic and administrative cost, but also financial.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.731
For coffee, it's estimated that it costs around 3 cents per pound.

00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:23.681
Now, that might not sound like a lot, but it does add up and for some farmers

00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:28.901
there is evidence to suggest that there is zero long-term benefit.

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:35.493
Secondly, there is a lack of transparency around how the

00:13:35.493 --> 00:13:42.113
Fairtrade premium is spent, how the extra money is spent by the cooperative.

00:13:43.493 --> 00:13:48.283
Fairtrade, the organisation, doesn't monitor this, doesn't

00:13:48.283 --> 00:13:55.888
monitor how the money is spent and even though the funds should be allocated democratically by the

00:13:55.888 --> 00:14:02.518
members of the cooperative, they aren't always spent on the things that will have the most impact.

00:14:03.538 --> 00:14:08.488
So from time to time, they are instead spent on buildings

00:14:08.488 --> 00:14:12.988
and salaries as opposed to schools or medical clinics.

00:14:14.739 --> 00:14:19.659
Thirdly, which is one that I think is actually a pretty interesting

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:26.349
criticism is that Fairtrade isn't actually a very effective way of transferring

00:14:26.349 --> 00:14:31.839
money from the people who consume the products to the people who produce them.

00:14:34.089 --> 00:14:41.019
There was an experiment done in San Francisco where they asked people how much more

00:14:41.049 --> 00:14:47.019
they would be willing to pay for a cup of Fairtrade coffee compared to a normal one.

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:49.239
The answer?

00:14:50.244 --> 00:14:55.344
The average person was willing to pay an extra 50 cents per cup.

00:14:56.764 --> 00:14:59.579
But the maximum amount of money from that same

00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:04.589
cup that a Fairtrade farmer would receive is one third of a cent.

00:15:06.454 --> 00:15:11.524
So people are prepared to pay a lot more for Fairtrade than they

00:15:11.524 --> 00:15:17.944
actually do, meaning that the Fairtrade farmer is on one level missing

00:15:17.944 --> 00:15:22.504
out on a large amount of money that consumers are prepared to pay.

00:15:24.455 --> 00:15:31.115
As a result of these kinds of criticisms, people and companies have started looking

00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:39.695
out for alternatives, other ways of achieving the mission of Fairtrade, but with different methods.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:46.426
From a trade point of view, the main alternative is direct trade.

00:15:47.706 --> 00:15:55.881
This just means that companies buy directly from the farmer or cooperative, and they aren't

00:15:55.881 --> 00:16:03.051
governed by Fairtrade standards that may not be applicable to that farmer or that product.

00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:09.951
The idea behind this is that they can form a long-term relationship, work

00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:16.341
on more equal terms, and it gets rid of some of the bureaucracy, costs

00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:21.665
and inefficiencies and overheads that come with Fairtrade.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:28.850
Another interesting development is that retailers and companies that sell things

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:34.894
like coffee, tea, and chocolate have started their own versions of Fairtrade.

00:16:36.304 --> 00:16:39.964
Sainsbury's, which is one of the biggest supermarket

00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:46.444
chains in the UK, has its own label now called 'Fairly Traded'.

00:16:47.792 --> 00:16:51.122
McDonald's has its own programme for its coffee.

00:16:51.602 --> 00:16:57.152
Nestle has its own version and Starbucks has its own one and they're all different.

00:16:58.201 --> 00:17:02.851
They are all supposedly doing this because they have decided

00:17:02.851 --> 00:17:07.265
that Fairtrade, the organisation, isn't the most effective

00:17:07.265 --> 00:17:13.865
way of them reaching their sustainability goals and that they can have more

00:17:13.865 --> 00:17:19.655
of an impact by bringing this activity in-house, by doing it themselves.

00:17:21.695 --> 00:17:27.419
Of course, people are quite sceptical about this because if there isn't

00:17:27.479 --> 00:17:34.572
any kind of external organisation that provides oversight, that reviews

00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:42.282
the terms of the trade between the company and the farmer, then we risk returning to a

00:17:42.282 --> 00:17:48.822
situation where the trade between the farmer and the buyer really isn't so fair anymore.

00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:58.362
The other risk here is that consumers, so people like me and you, we've got so used to

00:17:58.632 --> 00:18:05.982
different terms being thrown around: Fairtrade, organic, biological, fairly treated, ethically

00:18:05.982 --> 00:18:12.162
sourced, carbon neutral, and so on that we have become numb to what they really mean.

00:18:14.032 --> 00:18:20.607
You might just see a label or logo on a chocolate bar or banana or packet

00:18:20.607 --> 00:18:25.647
of coffee and think, well, that's probably a good thing, and put it in

00:18:25.647 --> 00:18:30.807
your shopping basket without really knowing anything about what it means.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:39.090
And at least with Fairtrade, it is a global body, a global organisation with

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:45.930
recognised standards, and you know that it is deeply aligned with the farmer's interests.

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:53.571
As we know from scandals like the Volkswagen one, when a company is in

00:18:53.571 --> 00:19:00.231
charge of monitoring its own standards, the incentives aren't aligned, and this means

00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:06.531
the company often doesn't do a very good job, to put it politely, of assessing itself.

00:19:08.661 --> 00:19:13.221
So Fairtrade is coming under quite a bit of pressure from

00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:18.171
various different market forces and its future is slightly uncertain.

00:19:19.451 --> 00:19:21.821
It needs the buyers, it needs the companies

00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:25.841
to buy from its cooperatives, otherwise there is no Fairtrade.

00:19:27.036 --> 00:19:30.966
And of course it needs the farmers, but it also needs the

00:19:30.966 --> 00:19:36.246
consumers to still opt for and demand Fairtrade products.

00:19:37.206 --> 00:19:41.226
And if it can't do this, it risks becoming irrelevant.

00:19:43.426 --> 00:19:47.656
Luckily it doesn't seem like that will happen in the very near future,

00:19:48.046 --> 00:19:54.226
but it is certainly a risk for Fairtrade, for the collectives it works with, and for

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:59.766
the farmers who have been getting a fair deal through being part of the programme.

00:20:01.153 --> 00:20:06.020
Whatever happens to Fairtrade in the future, what is undeniable

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:11.330
is that it has been an important force in educating consumers

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:16.160
about the global supply chain, about where their food actually comes from.

00:20:17.307 --> 00:20:20.166
And 'sustainability' has gone from

00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:25.326
being just a word that a company might mention in a small paragraph in

00:20:25.386 --> 00:20:30.396
their annual report to something that consumers actually do care about.

00:20:32.261 --> 00:20:37.432
So next time you reach for a banana, a bar of chocolate

00:20:37.452 --> 00:20:43.452
or your morning cup of coffee, and you see that Fairtrade label you

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:48.252
will at least now know a little bit more about what it actually means.

00:20:50.522 --> 00:20:54.242
Okay then that is it for today's episode.

00:20:54.722 --> 00:20:57.932
As always, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

00:20:58.972 --> 00:21:04.972
We actually have quite a lot of listeners in countries where a lot of Fairtrade products come from.

00:21:05.662 --> 00:21:09.652
Max Havelaar, the Dutch coffee was bought from a cooperative

00:21:09.682 --> 00:21:13.402
in Mexico, and I know we have a lot of Mexican listeners.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:20.332
Similarly, countries like Colombia and Brazil, there are a lot of listeners from those places too.

00:21:20.842 --> 00:21:25.162
So if you live in a country where there are a lot of Fairtrade producers,

00:21:25.537 --> 00:21:29.797
or even if you don't, I would love to know what you thought of the show.

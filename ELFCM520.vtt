Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.029
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.080
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three, the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.200
final part, of our three-part series on nuclear power.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.379
As a reminder, in part one we talked about the early days of nuclear

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.010
power, Dwight Eisenhower’s famous Atoms for Peace speech, and how

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.830
countries adopted it with a mixture of trepidation and excitement.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.180
In part two we talked about an event that turned excitement into fear

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.660
and opposition: the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.359
And in today’s episode, we are going to be talking about the state of

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.190
nuclear power today, and what this means for nuclear power in the future.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.370
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.050
On the 15th of April of last year, April of 2024, the power

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.300
was turned off at three nuclear power plants in Germany.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.150
Not just any three.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.680
The last three.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.660
Germany went from a country that had built 36 nuclear reactors,

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.486
which provided at their peak 30% of the nation’s power, down to 0.

00:01:34.629 --> 00:01:39.924
It was a spectacular reversal of policy, and is emblematic

00:01:40.113 --> 00:01:43.460
of the fate that nuclear power has had in many countries.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.240
In Germany, nuclear power was initially met with mixed excitement when the first domestic

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.660
nuclear power plant came online in 1961, but the 1970s saw a growing anti-nuclear movement.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:06.345
Nuclear power was associated with nuclear weapons, there was the issue of nuclear waste,

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:11.995
and there were unanswered questions about the environmental impact of nuclear power.

00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:18.822
These questions translated into large-scale protests, and then in the 1980s,

00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:23.661
the anti-nuclear movement morphed into its own political party in the form

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:28.980
of The Greens, which won 6% of the vote in the 1983 federal elections.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.790
Then, in 1986, not so far away from Germany, Chernobyl happened.

00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:43.418
Anti-nuclear sentiment ratcheted up a notch, and by 2000 there was an official agreement

00:02:43.578 --> 00:02:48.928
between the German government and the energy sector to phase out nuclear power.

00:02:50.328 --> 00:02:53.738
And just over 20 years later, it happened.

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:57.548
Germany is now nuclear power free.

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:02.078
When the last power plant wound down its generators for

00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:05.968
the very last time, it evoked very different emotions.

00:03:07.248 --> 00:03:13.158
To the Greens, it was something they had been fighting for for the best part of half a century.

00:03:13.678 --> 00:03:19.658
It was the end of an environmentally unfriendly, dangerous and unsustainable power source,

00:03:19.938 --> 00:03:26.732
and the sign of a bright step forward towards a renewable, green, sustainable energy future.

00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:33.024
To others, a minority of others in Germany, I should add, it was a step backwards.

00:03:33.884 --> 00:03:38.944
Shutting off domestic nuclear power as an option meant more reliance on dirty fossil

00:03:38.944 --> 00:03:45.374
fuels such as coal and gas, it meant greater reliance on Russia, and it would result

00:03:45.474 --> 00:03:50.978
in the German consumer paying more for less environmentally friendly electricity.

00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:57.844
So, before addressing the arguments on both sides of the nuclear debate, let

00:03:57.844 --> 00:04:02.494
us first take a look at the state of nuclear energy around the world today.

00:04:03.434 --> 00:04:08.954
Today, there are around 440 nuclear reactors in 32 different

00:04:08.954 --> 00:04:13.694
countries, which provide around 10% of the world’s energy.

00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:19.877
But, that number is very different on a country-by-country basis.

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:24.933
Germany, as you heard, has no nuclear power plants.

00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:31.583
Neighbouring France, on the other hand, gets around 70% of its power from nuclear sources,

00:04:31.843 --> 00:04:37.543
and is the third largest nuclear producer in the world, after the United States and China.

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:44.433
In fact, France generates so much energy from nuclear sources that it is a

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:50.213
net energy exporter, meaning that it sells electricity to other countries.

00:04:51.343 --> 00:04:57.503
And of its three largest energy customers, two–Germany and Italy–are countries

00:04:57.503 --> 00:05:02.773
that turned their backs on nuclear power, so even though Germans and Italians

00:05:02.993 --> 00:05:07.703
are nuclear power plant free, they are most certainly not nuclear energy free.

00:05:08.986 --> 00:05:12.966
If you’re wondering who the other top-three customer is, it’s the UK,

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:18.193
which does have its own nuclear energy sector, but turns to France when

00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:22.193
there is particularly high domestic demand and it needs a bit of a top-up.

00:05:23.043 --> 00:05:27.593
So, to recap, there are currently just under 500 nuclear

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:32.213
reactors worldwide, producing around 10% of the world’s power.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:38.913
Interestingly, this number has hardly changed since the early 1980s.

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:44.384
This doesn’t mean that no nuclear power plants have been built, quite the opposite.

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:51.404
Around 300 new nuclear reactors have been built since Chernobyl, with a large proportion of those

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:57.874
coming from Asia, and there are dozens more currently under construction, again, primarily in Asia.

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:05.939
But these new reactors have largely been offset by the decommissioning of old reactors,

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:11.350
especially in countries that have chosen to phase out nuclear power, like Germany and

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.699
Italy, meaning that the total number of nuclear reactors worldwide has not really changed.

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.209
So, why this division?

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:26.680
Why are some countries rushing towards  nuclear power, and others abandoning it?

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.070
The early promise of nuclear power was that it was going to

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.900
be a cheap, abundant, clean and safe source of electricity.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:44.570
So, let’s look at these in detail to see whether nuclear has achieved each of its promises.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.940
First, let’s talk about cost.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.380
The measure that analysts use here is the total cost per unit of electricity

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.650
produced, which takes into account everything that goes into creating the electricity:

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.260
mining the fossil fuels, in the case of coal, oil and gas, building the power

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.790
plants, building a dam in the case of hydroelectric power, installing the solar

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.450
panels, and of course the ongoing operational costs of generating the electricity.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.740
It can cost anywhere from a couple of billion dollars to 10 billion dollars

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.300
to build a nuclear power plant, and although the major costs are related to

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.680
construction, the operational costs of nuclear energy are not insignificant.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:42.660
And unlike almost every other energy source, these costs have increased, not decreased.

00:07:44.005 --> 00:07:49.695
This is primarily to do with increasing safety and regulatory requirements, which few are

00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:55.005
arguing against, but it is completely the opposite of what has happened to something like

00:07:55.025 --> 00:08:02.005
solar, for example, which has come down in cost by a whopping 90% in the past 10 years alone.

00:08:03.146 --> 00:08:09.821
As a result, when compared to almost every other source of energy, nuclear power is still not cheap.

00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:16.111
Its supporters, however, argue that this is not a failure of nuclear

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:21.421
energy per se, but a product of the fact that government investment in

00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:26.571
nuclear energy has been dwarfed by investment in renewable technologies.

00:08:27.361 --> 00:08:32.352
If governments had invested as much in nuclear as they had in solar and wind

00:08:32.392 --> 00:08:37.932
technology, then the price would have come down even further, so this is a

00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:43.993
direct result of anti-nuclear policy, not any inbuilt failure of nuclear energy.

00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:50.112
Now, as to the question of abundance, of whether nuclear energy is

00:08:50.182 --> 00:08:54.922
truly renewable, by the standard definition it is not renewable.

00:08:55.882 --> 00:09:00.193
Nuclear power requires uranium, of which there is a finite amount.

00:09:01.213 --> 00:09:04.723
By some estimates, there is only enough uranium for another

00:09:04.743 --> 00:09:09.173
20 years, while other estimates put it at 80 or 90 years.

00:09:10.243 --> 00:09:13.083
However, this is hotly debated.

00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:18.903
Firstly, there is the argument that mining companies always underestimate the

00:09:18.923 --> 00:09:24.743
total reserves, because the process of locating and proving reserves is expensive.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:29.603
In other words, there is no reason to suggest that the world is running out of

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:34.693
Uranium just because we don’t have the exact locations and details of every single

00:09:34.693 --> 00:09:39.733
Uranium deposit; more will be found to be used for many, many years to come.

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:47.049
And secondly, there is the more interesting argument that nuclear waste, the toxic

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:53.219
byproduct of producing nuclear energy, can actually be reused again and again.

00:09:54.359 --> 00:09:58.456
So we have a load more fuel just sitting there, and this

00:09:58.456 --> 00:10:02.076
can be used multiple times to generate more electricity.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:08.490
Not only this, but reusing nuclear waste also reduces its radioactivity

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:14.710
levels, so if countries heavily invested in reusing their nuclear waste, not

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:20.150
only would this reduce the need for new Uranium mining, but it would also

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.100
help address the question of the radioactive waste produced by nuclear power.

00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:31.313
Now, the third promise of nuclear power was that it was going to be clean.

00:10:32.893 --> 00:10:37.643
Ever since the industrial era, and still today, the primary way that

00:10:37.643 --> 00:10:42.283
humans have generated electricity has been by burning fossil fuels.

00:10:43.153 --> 00:10:48.963
Coal, oil, and natural gas, they all work beautifully well as a way to generate

00:10:48.993 --> 00:10:53.923
electricity, apart from the fact that burning them releases all sorts of

00:10:53.943 --> 00:10:58.473
chemicals into the atmosphere that causes air pollution and climate change.

00:10:59.583 --> 00:11:04.905
Now, when nuclear power was first proposed, the attraction around cleanliness

00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:09.405
had nothing to do with climate change; it was that people wouldn’t have to

00:11:09.405 --> 00:11:14.285
live near large chimneys that billowed nasty black smoke into the atmosphere.

00:11:15.609 --> 00:11:18.649
Nuclear power stations might have large chimneys,

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:22.829
but what they release is water vapour, it is steam.

00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:29.589
There have been accusations about plants occasionally releasing trace elements of other

00:11:29.589 --> 00:11:35.059
chemicals, but the steam coming from the chimney of a nuclear plant is not dangerous.

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:39.255
So is nuclear power “clean”?

00:11:40.275 --> 00:11:44.655
Well, when trying to calculate the environmental impact of an energy

00:11:44.655 --> 00:11:49.365
source, like when calculating the financial cost, analysts take into

00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:54.175
account all of the emissions that go into producing a unit of electricity.

00:11:55.145 --> 00:12:00.625
In the case of nuclear energy, there is the environmental impact of building a nuclear

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:06.135
power station, the not-insignificant environmental cost of mining the Uranium, the

00:12:06.135 --> 00:12:11.845
transportation and all of that, but when you look at the amount of CO2 emitted per

00:12:11.845 --> 00:12:17.125
unit of electricity produced by nuclear power, it compares incredibly favourably.

00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:24.465
To give you some numbers on this, nuclear power emits three tonnes of CO2 for

00:12:24.495 --> 00:12:30.095
every gigawatt hour, which is roughly the energy needs for 160 people in Europe.

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:36.924
Now, this probably doesn’t mean very much as an isolated fact, three tonnes of CO2 per

00:12:36.924 --> 00:12:47.605
gigawatt hour, but this compares to 820 tonnes for coal, 720 for oil and 490 for natural gas.

00:12:49.055 --> 00:12:55.725
In other words, coal emits 273 times more CO2 per unit of electricity,

00:12:56.125 --> 00:13:01.865
and even innocent-sounding natural gas emits 163 times more.

00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:07.075
And even compared to universally accepted “green”

00:13:07.075 --> 00:13:10.845
technologies, nuclear power scores very favourably.

00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:18.875
It emits up to 76 times less CO2 than biomass, and 11 times less than hydropower.

00:13:19.505 --> 00:13:23.395
It is even lower on a CO2 emissions level than solar

00:13:23.565 --> 00:13:26.715
and wind energy when you take everything into account.

00:13:27.555 --> 00:13:32.445
On almost every possible emissions scale, it is as clean as it gets.

00:13:33.475 --> 00:13:37.345
But, and it is a big but, moving onto the final question

00:13:37.345 --> 00:13:41.555
of safety, there is the large question of nuclear waste.

00:13:42.535 --> 00:13:46.425
Producing nuclear energy results in highly radioactive material

00:13:46.705 --> 00:13:50.795
that will remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:13:51.755 --> 00:13:56.145
Yes, there might have been no major incidents relating to nuclear waste storage

00:13:56.235 --> 00:14:02.575
to date, but this is only the very start of the nuclear waste lifecycle.

00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:09.395
It’s like saying a runner setting off on an ultra-marathon takes their first couple of steps and

00:14:09.395 --> 00:14:14.865
then assumes that just because the first two steps were fine, the next 100,000 will be fine as well.

00:14:15.505 --> 00:14:20.805
It is, by definition, a problem that will be left to future generations to resolve,

00:14:21.185 --> 00:14:26.755
not just my kids or their great grandchildren, it is even more extreme than people

00:14:26.755 --> 00:14:32.195
today having to deal with a problem left by the Ancient Greeks, so the argument goes.

00:14:33.085 --> 00:14:38.445
Then there is the question of what happens if there is an accident or a deliberate attack,

00:14:39.035 --> 00:14:44.385
are we really so stupid as to knowingly and willingly choose a power source that creates

00:14:44.385 --> 00:14:49.645
such a potentially deadly byproduct and have no real solution about what to do with it?

00:14:51.185 --> 00:14:55.625
But on the other hand, proponents of nuclear energy argue that the

00:14:55.675 --> 00:14:59.306
problem of what to do with nuclear waste has largely been solved.

00:14:59.496 --> 00:15:06.616
It can be stored safely and securely, the radioactivity levels decay at such a speed that after

00:15:06.626 --> 00:15:11.426
a few hundred years it is no longer nearly so dangerous, there haven’t been any incidents to

00:15:11.426 --> 00:15:18.186
date, and there is ever-evolving technology about reprocessing it and improving how it is stored.

00:15:19.146 --> 00:15:21.586
In short, it isn’t a genuine concern.

00:15:22.876 --> 00:15:26.846
And to address the additional part of the safety issue, there

00:15:26.846 --> 00:15:30.776
is the question of the safety of a nuclear power plant itself.

00:15:31.586 --> 00:15:36.416
Chernobyl, as we talked about in the last episode, was a tragic example

00:15:36.626 --> 00:15:40.596
of what can happen when things go wrong at a nuclear power plant.

00:15:41.926 --> 00:15:45.966
There had been an incident at the Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, 8

00:15:45.986 --> 00:15:50.766
years before Chernobyl, when there was a partial core meltdown, and the most

00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:55.636
recent disaster at a nuclear power plant happened at Fukushima, in 2011.

00:15:56.396 --> 00:16:00.566
All three of these nuclear accidents, to different degrees,

00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:04.876
severely damaged public trust in the safety of nuclear energy.

00:16:05.996 --> 00:16:11.406
If a mechanical failure, or human error, or a natural disaster can have

00:16:11.406 --> 00:16:16.166
such an impact on a nuclear power station, which is home to such toxic and

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:21.316
radioactive material, then surely we can’t continue to call them “safe”.

00:16:22.396 --> 00:16:28.366
But, the proponents of nuclear energy argue, these accidents simply couldn’t happen anymore.

00:16:28.896 --> 00:16:32.866
Modern nuclear plants are far more secure and safety

00:16:33.066 --> 00:16:36.586
is taken far more seriously, it simply wouldn’t happen.

00:16:37.826 --> 00:16:42.336
What’s more, these three accidents caused very few deaths.

00:16:43.256 --> 00:16:50.556
Nobody died in the Three Mile Island incident, Chernobyl was only responsible for around 30 direct

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:57.148
deaths, and Fukushima only resulted in one suspected death, which happened four years later.

00:16:58.232 --> 00:17:04.972
Even if we take the much higher estimated numbers from Chernobyl, so 200,000, total

00:17:04.972 --> 00:17:10.632
deaths from nuclear power pale in comparison to deaths from fossil fuel pollution.

00:17:11.772 --> 00:17:18.012
Yes, fossil fuel pollution might be less visible, and there isn’t the scary issue

00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:24.072
of cell-destroying radioactive material, but fossil fuels have killed many more

00:17:24.072 --> 00:17:30.172
people, not just in total but on a “deaths per unit of electricity produced” scale.

00:17:31.682 --> 00:17:36.942
To put a number on this, on a “deaths per unit of electricity produced”, nuclear

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:44.512
energy, for all of the scaremongering, to date has been 1% as deadly as fossil fuels.

00:17:45.912 --> 00:17:50.412
In other words, every unit of electricity produced by fossil fuels has

00:17:50.442 --> 00:17:55.763
caused 100 times more deaths than a unit produced by nuclear power.

00:17:57.172 --> 00:18:01.312
And perhaps even more surprising is that, according to one study,

00:18:01.732 --> 00:18:06.026
on a “deaths per unit of electricity produced”, nuclear power is

00:18:06.096 --> 00:18:11.156
even less deadly than renewable energy like solar, hydro and wind.

00:18:12.186 --> 00:18:17.536
Now, you might be thinking “That can’t be true”, but this takes into account stuff like

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:23.636
industrial accidents when putting up wind farms or solar panels, or hydroelectric dams breaking.

00:18:24.949 --> 00:18:30.189
The point is, in the 60-plus years of nuclear power, on a per unit of

00:18:30.189 --> 00:18:35.079
electricity produced, it is about the least deadly source of power available.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:40.939
All of this puts nuclear energy in an unusual situation.

00:18:42.099 --> 00:18:47.419
It is both loved and loathed by environmentalists, seen as a vital tool

00:18:47.419 --> 00:18:51.709
in the fight against fossil fuels and a dangerous risk to the environment

00:18:51.759 --> 00:18:55.449
and a barrier to the adoption of truly renewable energy sources.

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:03.019
Greenpeace, perhaps the best-known opponent to nuclear energy, makes its position abundantly

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:09.089
clear, writing “Greenpeace has always fought – and will continue to fight – vigorously

00:19:09.109 --> 00:19:14.879
against nuclear power because it is an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity.

00:19:15.479 --> 00:19:19.079
The only solution is to halt the expansion of all nuclear

00:19:19.079 --> 00:19:23.859
power, and for the shutdown of existing plants.” End quote.

00:19:25.409 --> 00:19:30.969
But other environmental groups, such as Environmental Progress, argue that

00:19:30.979 --> 00:19:36.389
it is a necessary key tool in the fight against dependence on fossil fuels.

00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:41.379
It isn’t the solution, but it is part of the solution.

00:19:42.089 --> 00:19:48.269
Nuclear reactors are safer than ever before, new technologies will bring the cost down, they

00:19:48.269 --> 00:19:55.189
argue, and these fears about catastrophic nuclear meltdowns are, quite simply, unfounded.

00:19:56.619 --> 00:20:02.209
Now, to wrap things up, as of the time of writing this episode, there are 59

00:20:02.229 --> 00:20:07.589
nuclear reactors currently under construction, with two-thirds of those in Asia.

00:20:08.599 --> 00:20:14.719
It might sound like a lot, but it’s about half what it was at its peak, in the early 1980s.

00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:20.429
While many European countries are turning their backs on nuclear energy,

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:25.429
and have either shut down all plants or are in the process of doing so,

00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:30.469
other countries, principally in Asia, are investing heavily into it.

00:20:31.743 --> 00:20:36.713
The International Energy Agency predicts that the nuclear energy sector could increase

00:20:36.713 --> 00:20:43.613
in size by 2.5 times by 2050, with practically all of that growth coming from Asia.

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:49.660
So this presents an interesting dynamic; a nuclear-powered

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.920
East, and a largely nuclear-shunning Europe.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.280
Time will only tell which is the smarter decision.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.340
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the future of nuclear power.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.760
And with that comes the end of this three-part mini-series

00:21:07.978 --> 00:21:11.318
on this complicated, controversial and important subject.

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:15.452
I hope it's been an interesting one, and if you had strong opinions on

00:21:15.452 --> 00:21:18.928
the matter beforehand, well that you might have learnt something new.

00:21:19.852 --> 00:21:22.602
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:22.912 --> 00:21:24.702
What do you think about nuclear power?

00:21:25.082 --> 00:21:27.692
Is it a potential solution in the fight against climate

00:21:27.692 --> 00:21:31.502
change, or is it a risk that countries are too willing to take?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.933
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.029
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.080
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three, the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.200
final part, of our three-part series on nuclear power.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.379
As a reminder, in part one we talked about the early days of nuclear

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.010
power, Dwight Eisenhower’s famous Atoms for Peace speech, and how

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.830
countries adopted it with a mixture of trepidation and excitement.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.180
In part two we talked about an event that turned excitement into fear

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.660
and opposition: the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.359
And in today’s episode, we are going to be talking about the state of

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.190
nuclear power today, and what this means for nuclear power in the future.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.370
OK then, let’s not waste a minute, and get right into it.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.050
On the 15th of April of last year, April of 2023.

00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:18.316
the power was turned off at three nuclear power plants in Germany.

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:20.166
Not just any three.

00:01:20.616 --> 00:01:21.696
The last three.

00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:27.676
Germany went from a country that had built 36 nuclear reactors,

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:33.502
which provided at their peak 30% of the nation’s power, down to 0.

00:01:34.646 --> 00:01:39.940
It was a spectacular reversal of policy, and is emblematic

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:43.476
of the fate that nuclear power has had in many countries.

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:51.256
In Germany, nuclear power was initially met with mixed excitement when the first domestic

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:59.676
nuclear power plant came online in 1961, but the 1970s saw a growing anti-nuclear movement.

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:06.361
Nuclear power was associated with nuclear weapons, there was the issue of nuclear waste,

00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:12.011
and there were unanswered questions about the environmental impact of nuclear power.

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:18.838
These questions translated into large-scale protests, and then in the 1980s,

00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:23.678
the anti-nuclear movement morphed into its own political party in the form

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:28.996
of The Greens, which won 6% of the vote in the 1983 federal elections.

00:02:29.826 --> 00:02:35.806
Then, in 1986, not so far away from Germany, Chernobyl happened.

00:02:36.754 --> 00:02:43.434
Anti-nuclear sentiment ratcheted up a notch, and by 2000 there was an official agreement

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:48.944
between the German government and the energy sector to phase out nuclear power.

00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:53.754
And just over 20 years later, it happened.

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:57.564
Germany is now nuclear power free.

00:02:58.314 --> 00:03:02.094
When the last power plant wound down its generators for

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:05.984
the very last time, it evoked very different emotions.

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:13.174
To the Greens, it was something they had been fighting for for the best part of half a century.

00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:19.674
It was the end of an environmentally unfriendly, dangerous and unsustainable power source,

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:26.749
and the sign of a bright step forward towards a renewable, green, sustainable energy future.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:33.040
To others, a minority of others in Germany, I should add, it was a step backwards.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.960
Shutting off domestic nuclear power as an option meant more reliance on dirty fossil

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.390
fuels such as coal and gas, it meant greater reliance on Russia, and it would result

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.995
in the German consumer paying more for less environmentally friendly electricity.

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:57.860
So, before addressing the arguments on both sides of the nuclear debate, let

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.510
us first take a look at the state of nuclear energy around the world today.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.970
Today, there are around 440 nuclear reactors in 32 different

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.710
countries, which provide around 10% of the world’s energy.

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:19.894
But, that number is very different on a country-by-country basis.

00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:24.949
Germany, as you heard, has no nuclear power plants.

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:31.599
Neighbouring France, on the other hand, gets around 70% of its power from nuclear sources,

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:37.559
and is the third largest nuclear producer in the world, after the United States and China.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:44.449
In fact, France generates so much energy from nuclear sources that it is a

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.229
net energy exporter, meaning that it sells electricity to other countries.

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:57.519
And of its three largest energy customers, two–Germany and Italy–are countries

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:02.789
that turned their backs on nuclear power, so even though Germans and Italians

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.719
are nuclear power plant free, they are most certainly not nuclear energy free.

00:05:09.003 --> 00:05:12.983
If you’re wondering who the other top-three customer is, it’s the UK,

00:05:13.283 --> 00:05:18.209
which does have its own nuclear energy sector, but turns to France when

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.209
there is particularly high domestic demand and it needs a bit of a top-up.

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:27.609
So, to recap, there are currently just under 500 nuclear

00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:32.229
reactors worldwide, producing around 10% of the world’s power.

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:38.929
Interestingly, this number has hardly changed since the early 1980s.

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:44.400
This doesn’t mean that no nuclear power plants have been built, quite the opposite.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.420
Around 300 new nuclear reactors have been built since Chernobyl, with a large proportion of those

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.890
coming from Asia, and there are dozens more currently under construction, again, primarily in Asia.

00:05:58.885 --> 00:06:05.955
But these new reactors have largely been offset by the decommissioning of old reactors,

00:06:06.285 --> 00:06:11.366
especially in countries that have chosen to phase out nuclear power, like Germany and

00:06:11.366 --> 00:06:16.715
Italy, meaning that the total number of nuclear reactors worldwide has not really changed.

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:20.225
So, why this division?

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:26.697
Why are some countries rushing towards  nuclear power, and others abandoning it?

00:06:28.567 --> 00:06:32.087
The early promise of nuclear power was that it was going to

00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:36.917
be a cheap, abundant, clean and safe source of electricity.

00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:44.587
So, let’s look at these in detail to see whether nuclear has achieved each of its promises.

00:06:45.637 --> 00:06:47.957
First, let’s talk about cost.

00:06:48.977 --> 00:06:54.397
The measure that analysts use here is the total cost per unit of electricity

00:06:54.397 --> 00:06:59.667
produced, which takes into account everything that goes into creating the electricity:

00:07:00.177 --> 00:07:05.277
mining the fossil fuels, in the case of coal, oil and gas, building the power

00:07:05.277 --> 00:07:10.807
plants, building a dam in the case of hydroelectric power, installing the solar

00:07:10.807 --> 00:07:16.467
panels, and of course the ongoing operational costs of generating the electricity.

00:07:17.647 --> 00:07:22.757
It can cost anywhere from a couple of billion dollars to 10 billion dollars

00:07:22.997 --> 00:07:28.317
to build a nuclear power plant, and although the major costs are related to

00:07:28.317 --> 00:07:33.697
construction, the operational costs of nuclear energy are not insignificant.

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:42.676
And unlike almost every other energy source, these costs have increased, not decreased.

00:07:44.021 --> 00:07:49.711
This is primarily to do with increasing safety and regulatory requirements, which few are

00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:55.021
arguing against, but it is completely the opposite of what has happened to something like

00:07:55.041 --> 00:08:02.021
solar, for example, which has come down in cost by a whopping 90% in the past 10 years alone.

00:08:03.162 --> 00:08:09.838
As a result, when compared to almost every other source of energy, nuclear power is still not cheap.

00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:16.128
Its supporters, however, argue that this is not a failure of nuclear

00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:21.438
energy per se, but a product of the fact that government investment in

00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:26.588
nuclear energy has been dwarfed by investment in renewable technologies.

00:08:27.378 --> 00:08:32.369
If governments had invested as much in nuclear as they had in solar and wind

00:08:32.409 --> 00:08:37.949
technology, then the price would have come down even further, so this is a

00:08:37.989 --> 00:08:44.009
direct result of anti-nuclear policy, not any inbuilt failure of nuclear energy.

00:08:45.009 --> 00:08:50.129
Now, as to the question of abundance, of whether nuclear energy is

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:54.939
truly renewable, by the standard definition it is not renewable.

00:08:55.899 --> 00:09:00.209
Nuclear power requires uranium, of which there is a finite amount.

00:09:01.229 --> 00:09:04.739
By some estimates, there is only enough uranium for another

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:09.189
20 years, while other estimates put it at 80 or 90 years.

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:13.099
However, this is hotly debated.

00:09:14.089 --> 00:09:18.919
Firstly, there is the argument that mining companies always underestimate the

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:24.759
total reserves, because the process of locating and proving reserves is expensive.

00:09:25.949 --> 00:09:29.619
In other words, there is no reason to suggest that the world is running out of

00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:34.709
Uranium just because we don’t have the exact locations and details of every single

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:39.749
Uranium deposit; more will be found to be used for many, many years to come.

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:47.065
And secondly, there is the more interesting argument that nuclear waste, the toxic

00:09:47.075 --> 00:09:53.235
byproduct of producing nuclear energy, can actually be reused again and again.

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:58.473
So we have a load more fuel just sitting there, and this

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:02.093
can be used multiple times to generate more electricity.

00:10:03.306 --> 00:10:08.506
Not only this, but reusing nuclear waste also reduces its radioactivity

00:10:08.506 --> 00:10:14.726
levels, so if countries heavily invested in reusing their nuclear waste, not

00:10:14.776 --> 00:10:20.166
only would this reduce the need for new Uranium mining, but it would also

00:10:20.176 --> 00:10:25.116
help address the question of the radioactive waste produced by nuclear power.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:31.330
Now, the third promise of nuclear power was that it was going to be clean.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.660
Ever since the industrial era, and still today, the primary way that

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.300
humans have generated electricity has been by burning fossil fuels.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.980
Coal, oil, and natural gas, they all work beautifully well as a way to generate

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.940
electricity, apart from the fact that burning them releases all sorts of

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.490
chemicals into the atmosphere that causes air pollution and climate change.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.921
Now, when nuclear power was first proposed, the attraction around cleanliness

00:11:05.211 --> 00:11:09.421
had nothing to do with climate change; it was that people wouldn’t have to

00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:14.301
live near large chimneys that billowed nasty black smoke into the atmosphere.

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:18.665
Nuclear power stations might have large chimneys,

00:11:18.905 --> 00:11:22.845
but what they release is water vapour, it is steam.

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:29.605
There have been accusations about plants occasionally releasing trace elements of other

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:35.075
chemicals, but the steam coming from the chimney of a nuclear plant is not dangerous.

00:11:36.382 --> 00:11:39.272
So is nuclear power “clean”?

00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:44.672
Well, when trying to calculate the environmental impact of an energy

00:11:44.672 --> 00:11:49.382
source, like when calculating the financial cost, analysts take into

00:11:49.382 --> 00:11:54.192
account all of the emissions that go into producing a unit of electricity.

00:11:55.162 --> 00:12:00.642
In the case of nuclear energy, there is the environmental impact of building a nuclear

00:12:00.642 --> 00:12:06.152
power station, the not-insignificant environmental cost of mining the Uranium, the

00:12:06.152 --> 00:12:11.862
transportation and all of that, but when you look at the amount of CO2 emitted per

00:12:11.862 --> 00:12:17.142
unit of electricity produced by nuclear power, it compares incredibly favourably.

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:24.482
To give you some numbers on this, nuclear power emits three tonnes of CO2 for

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:30.112
every gigawatt hour, which is roughly the energy needs for 160 people in Europe.

00:12:31.052 --> 00:12:36.941
Now, this probably doesn’t mean very much as an isolated fact, three tonnes of CO2 per

00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:47.622
gigawatt hour, but this compares to 820 tonnes for coal, 720 for oil and 490 for natural gas.

00:12:49.072 --> 00:12:55.742
In other words, coal emits 273 times more CO2 per unit of electricity,

00:12:56.142 --> 00:13:01.882
and even innocent-sounding natural gas emits 163 times more.

00:13:03.372 --> 00:13:07.092
And even compared to universally accepted “green”

00:13:07.092 --> 00:13:10.861
technologies, nuclear power scores very favourably.

00:13:11.772 --> 00:13:18.892
It emits up to 76 times less CO2 than biomass, and 11 times less than hydropower.

00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:23.412
It is even lower on a CO2 emissions level than solar

00:13:23.582 --> 00:13:26.732
and wind energy when you take everything into account.

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:32.462
On almost every possible emissions scale, it is as clean as it gets.

00:13:33.492 --> 00:13:37.362
But, and it is a big but, moving onto the final question

00:13:37.362 --> 00:13:41.572
of safety, there is the large question of nuclear waste.

00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:46.442
Producing nuclear energy results in highly radioactive material

00:13:46.722 --> 00:13:50.812
that will remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:13:51.772 --> 00:13:56.162
Yes, there might have been no major incidents relating to nuclear waste storage

00:13:56.252 --> 00:14:02.592
to date, but this is only the very start of the nuclear waste lifecycle.

00:14:03.332 --> 00:14:09.412
It’s like saying a runner setting off on an ultra-marathon takes their first couple of steps and

00:14:09.412 --> 00:14:14.882
then assumes that just because the first two steps were fine, the next 100,000 will be fine as well.

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:20.822
It is, by definition, a problem that will be left to future generations to resolve,

00:14:21.202 --> 00:14:26.772
not just my kids or their great grandchildren, it is even more extreme than people

00:14:26.772 --> 00:14:32.212
today having to deal with a problem left by the Ancient Greeks, so the argument goes.

00:14:33.102 --> 00:14:38.462
Then there is the question of what happens if there is an accident or a deliberate attack,

00:14:39.052 --> 00:14:44.402
are we really so stupid as to knowingly and willingly choose a power source that creates

00:14:44.402 --> 00:14:49.662
such a potentially deadly byproduct and have no real solution about what to do with it?

00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:55.642
But on the other hand, proponents of nuclear energy argue that the

00:14:55.692 --> 00:14:59.322
problem of what to do with nuclear waste has largely been solved.

00:14:59.512 --> 00:15:06.632
It can be stored safely and securely, the radioactivity levels decay at such a speed that after

00:15:06.642 --> 00:15:11.442
a few hundred years it is no longer nearly so dangerous, there haven’t been any incidents to

00:15:11.442 --> 00:15:18.202
date, and there is ever-evolving technology about reprocessing it and improving how it is stored.

00:15:19.162 --> 00:15:21.602
In short, it isn’t a genuine concern.

00:15:22.892 --> 00:15:26.862
And to address the additional part of the safety issue, there

00:15:26.862 --> 00:15:30.792
is the question of the safety of a nuclear power plant itself.

00:15:31.602 --> 00:15:36.432
Chernobyl, as we talked about in the last episode, was a tragic example

00:15:36.642 --> 00:15:40.612
of what can happen when things go wrong at a nuclear power plant.

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:45.982
There had been an incident at the Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, 8

00:15:46.002 --> 00:15:50.782
years before Chernobyl, when there was a partial core meltdown, and the most

00:15:50.782 --> 00:15:55.652
recent disaster at a nuclear power plant happened at Fukushima, in 2011.

00:15:56.412 --> 00:16:00.582
All three of these nuclear accidents, to different degrees,

00:16:00.952 --> 00:16:04.892
severely damaged public trust in the safety of nuclear energy.

00:16:06.012 --> 00:16:11.422
If a mechanical failure, or human error, or a natural disaster can have

00:16:11.422 --> 00:16:16.182
such an impact on a nuclear power station, which is home to such toxic and

00:16:16.182 --> 00:16:21.332
radioactive material, then surely we can’t continue to call them “safe”.

00:16:22.412 --> 00:16:28.382
But, the proponents of nuclear energy argue, these accidents simply couldn’t happen anymore.

00:16:28.912 --> 00:16:32.882
Modern nuclear plants are far more secure and safety

00:16:33.082 --> 00:16:36.602
is taken far more seriously, it simply wouldn’t happen.

00:16:37.842 --> 00:16:42.352
What’s more, these three accidents caused very few deaths.

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:50.572
Nobody died in the Three Mile Island incident, Chernobyl was only responsible for around 30 direct

00:16:50.592 --> 00:16:57.164
deaths, and Fukushima only resulted in one suspected death, which happened four years later.

00:16:58.248 --> 00:17:04.988
Even if we take the much higher estimated numbers from Chernobyl, so 200,000, total

00:17:04.988 --> 00:17:10.648
deaths from nuclear power pale in comparison to deaths from fossil fuel pollution.

00:17:11.788 --> 00:17:18.028
Yes, fossil fuel pollution might be less visible, and there isn’t the scary issue

00:17:18.028 --> 00:17:24.088
of cell-destroying radioactive material, but fossil fuels have killed many more

00:17:24.088 --> 00:17:30.188
people, not just in total but on a “deaths per unit of electricity produced” scale.

00:17:31.698 --> 00:17:36.958
To put a number on this, on a “deaths per unit of electricity produced”, nuclear

00:17:36.988 --> 00:17:44.528
energy, for all of the scaremongering, to date has been 1% as deadly as fossil fuels.

00:17:45.928 --> 00:17:50.428
In other words, every unit of electricity produced by fossil fuels has

00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:55.779
caused 100 times more deaths than a unit produced by nuclear power.

00:17:57.188 --> 00:18:01.328
And perhaps even more surprising is that, according to one study,

00:18:01.748 --> 00:18:06.042
on a “deaths per unit of electricity produced”, nuclear power is

00:18:06.112 --> 00:18:11.172
even less deadly than renewable energy like solar, hydro and wind.

00:18:12.202 --> 00:18:17.552
Now, you might be thinking “That can’t be true”, but this takes into account stuff like

00:18:17.612 --> 00:18:23.652
industrial accidents when putting up wind farms or solar panels, or hydroelectric dams breaking.

00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:30.206
The point is, in the 60-plus years of nuclear power, on a per unit of

00:18:30.206 --> 00:18:35.096
electricity produced, it is about the least deadly source of power available.

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:40.956
All of this puts nuclear energy in an unusual situation.

00:18:42.116 --> 00:18:47.436
It is both loved and loathed by environmentalists, seen as a vital tool

00:18:47.436 --> 00:18:51.726
in the fight against fossil fuels and a dangerous risk to the environment

00:18:51.776 --> 00:18:55.466
and a barrier to the adoption of truly renewable energy sources.

00:18:56.786 --> 00:19:03.036
Greenpeace, perhaps the best-known opponent to nuclear energy, makes its position abundantly

00:19:03.036 --> 00:19:09.106
clear, writing “Greenpeace has always fought – and will continue to fight – vigorously

00:19:09.126 --> 00:19:14.896
against nuclear power because it is an unacceptable risk to the environment and to humanity.

00:19:15.496 --> 00:19:19.096
The only solution is to halt the expansion of all nuclear

00:19:19.096 --> 00:19:23.876
power, and for the shutdown of existing plants.” End quote.

00:19:25.426 --> 00:19:30.986
But other environmental groups, such as Environmental Progress, argue that

00:19:30.996 --> 00:19:36.406
it is a necessary key tool in the fight against dependence on fossil fuels.

00:19:37.046 --> 00:19:41.396
It isn’t the solution, but it is part of the solution.

00:19:42.106 --> 00:19:48.286
Nuclear reactors are safer than ever before, new technologies will bring the cost down, they

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:55.206
argue, and these fears about catastrophic nuclear meltdowns are, quite simply, unfounded.

00:19:56.636 --> 00:20:02.226
Now, to wrap things up, as of the time of writing this episode, there are 59

00:20:02.246 --> 00:20:07.606
nuclear reactors currently under construction, with two-thirds of those in Asia.

00:20:08.616 --> 00:20:14.736
It might sound like a lot, but it’s about half what it was at its peak, in the early 1980s.

00:20:16.086 --> 00:20:20.446
While many European countries are turning their backs on nuclear energy,

00:20:20.816 --> 00:20:25.446
and have either shut down all plants or are in the process of doing so,

00:20:26.066 --> 00:20:30.486
other countries, principally in Asia, are investing heavily into it.

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:36.729
The International Energy Agency predicts that the nuclear energy sector could increase

00:20:36.729 --> 00:20:43.629
in size by 2.5 times by 2050, with practically all of that growth coming from Asia.

00:20:44.693 --> 00:20:49.676
So this presents an interesting dynamic; a nuclear-powered

00:20:49.726 --> 00:20:52.936
East, and a largely nuclear-shunning Europe.

00:20:54.156 --> 00:20:57.296
Time will only tell which is the smarter decision.

00:20:59.976 --> 00:21:04.356
OK then, that is it for today's episode on the future of nuclear power.

00:21:04.816 --> 00:21:07.776
And with that comes the end of this three-part mini-series

00:21:07.994 --> 00:21:11.334
on this complicated, controversial and important subject.

00:21:11.716 --> 00:21:15.468
I hope it's been an interesting one, and if you had strong opinions on

00:21:15.468 --> 00:21:18.944
the matter beforehand, well that you might have learnt something new.

00:21:19.868 --> 00:21:22.618
As always, I would love to know what you thought of this episode.

00:21:22.928 --> 00:21:24.718
What do you think about nuclear power?

00:21:25.098 --> 00:21:27.708
Is it a potential solution in the fight against climate

00:21:27.708 --> 00:21:31.518
change, or is it a risk that countries are too willing to take?

00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:34.949
I would love to know, so let’s get this discussion started.

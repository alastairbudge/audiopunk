Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.439
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.640
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.930
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part three of our three-part mini-series on the theme of “mystery”.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.129
In case you missed them, in part one we talked about secret societies,

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.899
from Skull & Bones at Yale University through to the Knights Templar.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.140
In part two, we talked about espionage and the history of spying.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.119
And today, in our final episode, we are going to take a look at some legendary lost cities

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.269
and civilisations that have puzzled, fascinated, and eluded explorers for centuries.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:00.191
So, let’s not waste a minute and get right into it.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.850
In the early 2000s, one of the founders of Google, Larry Page,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.820
had a crazy idea: to create a 360-degree map of the world.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.540
In 2004, he brought a few Google engineers together and got them working on a prototype.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.320
They fixed a camera onto a van and off it set, taking

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.860
pictures of everything around it as it drove around the city.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.220
Fast forward to today, and this vision is Google Streetview, or rather,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.020
Google Maps, Google Earth, and Google Streetview all rolled into one.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.675
As of the last public update, there are more than 15 million kilometers of road mapped with

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:58.601
Streetview, and high-definition satellite imagery in Google Earth covers 98% of the world’s surface.

00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:07.301
It's probably quite a bit more now, as this last public update was back in 2019, six years ago.

00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:16.155
And with this incredible technology, it can feel like there’s no part of the world left to discover.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:23.195
Every mountain peak, every island, every jungle seems just a click or a swipe away.

00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:28.745
It’s easy to believe that humanity has left no stone unturned.

00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:35.335
But what if there is something lurking in that 2% of unmapped

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:40.545
territory, underwater, deep in the jungle, or hidden in the rainforest?

00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:45.365
Cities or entire civilisations lost to time.

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:54.165
This will be the subject of today’s episode, places spoken of in hushed tones, places that,

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:59.815
in the case of all three examples we’ll look at today, have become more legend than reality.

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:07.005
The first one we will talk about is a name that will probably be familiar to you: Atlantis.

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:12.265
The word Atlantis probably conjures up images of an ancient city

00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:16.945
under the sea, its only residents now brightly-coloured fish and the

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:22.135
occasional crab scuttling across a formerly magnificent ruined arch.

00:03:22.945 --> 00:03:29.282
It is the quintessential “lost city” and has become almost a byword for a

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:34.450
mysterious civilisation that simply disappeared from the face of the earth.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.920
So, what is Atlantis, where is it, supposedly, and is there any truth to its existence?

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.870
Well, let’s start with where the story of Atlantis comes from.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.470
The first and most significant reference to Atlantis comes from the writings of the ancient

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:02.315
Greek philosopher Plato, in two of his dialogues, Timaeus and Critias, written around 360 BC.

00:04:03.748 --> 00:04:12.378
In these texts, Plato describes Atlantis as a powerful and advanced civilisation located beyond

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:18.868
the “Pillars of Hercules,” which sounds mythical and exotic, but we now know he simply meant

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:25.358
the Strait of Gibraltar, where southern Spain meets northern Africa, Morocco to be precise.

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:32.858
According to Plato, Atlantis was a utopian society blessed with

00:04:32.868 --> 00:04:37.188
great wealth, advanced technology, and a strong naval power.

00:04:38.198 --> 00:04:46.058
Its people lived in harmony, ruled by just kings, and their city was a marvel of engineering—a

00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:52.908
series of concentric rings of land and water with a grand temple to Poseidon at its centre.

00:04:54.168 --> 00:05:02.048
But then, as the story goes, the people of Atlantis became greedy, corrupt, and power-hungry.

00:05:02.758 --> 00:05:08.518
They tried to conquer their neighbours, only to be defeated by the virtuous Athenians.

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:15.072
As punishment for their hubris, the gods unleashed a series of catastrophic

00:05:15.072 --> 00:05:20.932
earthquakes and floods that sank Atlantis beneath the sea in a single day and night.

00:05:21.982 --> 00:05:26.262
It’s an extraordinary tale, but was it meant to be taken literally?

00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:29.532
No, almost certainly, it was not.

00:05:30.522 --> 00:05:36.252
Most historians believe that Plato invented Atlantis as a moral allegory—a

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:40.732
way to warn against the dangers of arrogance and unchecked ambition.

00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:44.832
It was a cautionary tale, not a historical account.

00:05:45.482 --> 00:05:50.572
There is absolutely no archaeological evidence for anything resembling Atlantis,

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:55.692
and it's pretty clear that Plato used it as an allegorical device in his story.

00:05:56.132 --> 00:06:02.252
So given this, why does the world Atlantis conjure up images of great temples

00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:07.482
on the sea bed, why are hit TV shows on Netflix suggesting that there are hidden

00:06:07.522 --> 00:06:11.892
underwater civilisations, such as Atlantis, that we simply don’t know about?

00:06:12.892 --> 00:06:19.942
Well, like many myths, over time, people have been inspired by its story and written

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:25.842
their own versions, and it has evolved into something many believe to be true.

00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:32.852
To put a number on this, according to one recent survey, 57% of

00:06:32.852 --> 00:06:38.192
Americans believe that Atlantis or other ancient civilisations existed.

00:06:39.144 --> 00:06:44.554
To this, the natural question is, “If they existed, where are they now?”.

00:06:45.894 --> 00:06:51.504
Over the centuries, countless theories have emerged about where Atlantis might have been.

00:06:52.524 --> 00:06:55.884
There’s one theory that Atlantis was actually based on the

00:06:55.884 --> 00:07:00.431
Minoans, who lived more than 1000 years before Plato was born.

00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:06.541
The Minoans lived in Crete and later in Santorini, in the eastern Mediterranean.

00:07:07.361 --> 00:07:10.421
They were an advanced society, known for their impressive

00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:14.131
palaces, intricate art, and thriving trade networks.

00:07:14.591 --> 00:07:23.421
But their civilisation was dealt a devastating blow by a massive volcanic eruption around 1600 BCE.

00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:28.521
This eruption all but wiped out the Minoans on Santorini, leaving

00:07:28.521 --> 00:07:32.431
their settlements buried under ash and their culture in decline.

00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:38.211
Some believe this catastrophe may have inspired the legend of Atlantis.

00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:44.781
It’s a plausible explanation: a flourishing civilisation destroyed suddenly

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:49.091
and dramatically, leaving echoes of its memory to shape later myths.

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:54.111
But for many, this theory isn’t thrilling enough.

00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:59.891
A mere volcanic eruption in the Mediterranean doesn’t quite capture the imagination.

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:05.411
Instead, people have pointed to locations as far-flung as the

00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:09.863
Azores, Antarctica, or even beneath the Atlantic Ocean itself.

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:16.303
And while these theories make for great stories, they lack evidence.

00:08:17.183 --> 00:08:22.243
To date, no trace of Atlantis has ever been found, and virtually

00:08:22.243 --> 00:08:26.443
no serious archaeologist or classicist believes it ever existed.

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:31.933
The legend, it seems, is destined to remain just that—a legend.

00:08:33.243 --> 00:08:38.673
Next, let’s move from a city supposedly lost beneath the waves to one said

00:08:38.753 --> 00:08:43.893
to be hidden deep in the jungles of South America: the legendary El Dorado.

00:08:44.743 --> 00:08:47.393
El Dorado, “the golden one”, in Spanish.

00:08:47.963 --> 00:08:52.103
The very name conjures images of untold wealth, glittering

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:56.453
gold, and the promise of paradise hidden deep within the jungle.

00:08:57.493 --> 00:09:03.983
But unlike Atlantis, El Dorado wasn’t a city at all—at least, not at first.

00:09:04.703 --> 00:09:06.493
It started as a man.

00:09:07.533 --> 00:09:13.463
Now, it’s difficult to trace exactly where this legend came from, but it is

00:09:13.463 --> 00:09:18.133
believed to have been started by the Muisca people of present-day Colombia.

00:09:18.983 --> 00:09:23.163
According to the legend, when a new ruler, or zipa, was

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:28.094
crowned, they would perform a sacred ceremony at Lake Guatavita.

00:09:28.813 --> 00:09:33.263
The zipa would cover his body in gold dust and sail

00:09:33.263 --> 00:09:36.723
to the centre of the lake on a raft made of reeds.

00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:40.933
Surrounded by priests, he would then offer gold and precious

00:09:40.953 --> 00:09:44.133
treasures to the gods by throwing them into the water.

00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:49.343
This ritual, recounted to early Spanish explorers in the 16th

00:09:49.343 --> 00:09:54.543
century, sparked the idea of El Hombre Dorado—the Golden Man.

00:09:56.003 --> 00:10:01.193
But as the story spread among European adventurers, it evolved.

00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:07.163
El Dorado was no longer just a man; it became a mythical city, then

00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:12.343
an entire kingdom, said to be overflowing with unimaginable riches.

00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:18.533
A king so rich that he covered himself in gold every morning and would wash it off at

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:24.713
night, so plentiful were the gold reserves that it would simply be discarded, washed away.

00:10:25.953 --> 00:10:30.923
For the Spanish conquistadors, who were already hungry for gold after plundering

00:10:30.943 --> 00:10:36.193
the Aztec and Inca empires, the promise of El Dorado was irresistible.

00:10:37.583 --> 00:10:42.063
Explorers like Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and Francisco de Orellana

00:10:42.523 --> 00:10:46.313
ventured deep into the Amazon in search of this golden city.

00:10:47.403 --> 00:10:51.943
These expeditions were perilous, often ending in death from

00:10:51.943 --> 00:10:56.033
disease, starvation, or clashes with indigenous tribes.

00:10:57.133 --> 00:11:02.298
And it wasn’t just the Spanish who were tempted by the mystery of El Dorado.

00:11:02.603 --> 00:11:07.163
One of the most famous searches for El Dorado was led by Sir Walter

00:11:07.173 --> 00:11:11.356
Raleigh, the English explorer and favourite of Queen Elizabeth I.

00:11:12.286 --> 00:11:18.470
Not only was he tempted, but he believed he had discovered exactly where it was.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:26.230
Raleigh believed El Dorado was located along the Orinoco River in present-day Venezuela.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.140
In 1595, 50 years after the first written record of El Dorado, the

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.930
Englishman set out with high hopes, only to return empty-handed.

00:11:39.027 --> 00:11:45.150
Undeterred, he launched a second expedition years later, but it too ended in

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:50.660
failure—and ultimately contributed to his downfall and subsequent execution.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:58.900
For many explorers, the search for El Dorado wasn’t just a quest for riches—it was an obsession.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.310
Men risked everything, losing fortunes, reputations, and even their

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:09.170
lives, chasing what might have been nothing more than a dream.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.860
Despite the futility of these expeditions, the legend of El Dorado refused to die.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:21.250
It became a symbol of human greed and obsession, the idea that somewhere

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.350
out there lay a treasure so vast it could change the fate of nations.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.690
But was there any truth to the story, is there any truth to the story?

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:38.630
While the idea of a single golden city may be a myth, archaeologists have

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.180
uncovered evidence of sophisticated ancient civilisations in the Amazon.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.410
These societies, which were once dismissed as primitive, built large interconnected

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.960
settlements with intricate road systems, canals, and advanced agricultural practices.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.770
They may not have been the glittering city of legend, but

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.130
they were impressive civilisations in their own right.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.410
And this brings us to our final story, one that’s less

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.490
about gold and more about obsession: The City of Z.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.740
The City of Z is a legend that captivated one man so

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.850
completely that he was willing to risk everything to find it.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.720
That man’s name was Percy Harrison Fawcett.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.570
He was an adventurer in the classic sense.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:40.670
He was born in 1867, in England, and after working as a spy in North Africa, he spent much

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:46.370
of his career mapping uncharted regions of South America for the Royal Geographical Society.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.130
And his stories and reputation were legendary.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:58.090
He claimed to have seen dogs with two noses, to have shot and killed a 20-metre-long

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:03.834
snake, and it seemed that he was practically immune to all of the tropical diseases

00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:08.924
that would often kill his fellow Europeans within days of arriving in the rainforest.

00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:16.348
Unlike other European explorers, he appeared to approach his exploration without any sense

00:14:16.348 --> 00:14:21.878
of superiority, he didn’t think that he was the great European conqueror who was there to

00:14:21.968 --> 00:14:28.239
teach and subdue the local tribes; he was known for treating anyone he met as his equal.

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:34.399
He had, of course, heard about the legend of El Dorado, but during his

00:14:34.429 --> 00:14:39.999
expeditions into the Amazon, he heard stories from indigenous tribes, stories

00:14:40.349 --> 00:14:45.909
that sounded a little like El Dorado, but were perhaps even more intriguing.

00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:51.639
These stories were of ancient ruins hidden deep within the jungle.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.530
These weren’t just abandoned villages—they were said to be the remnants of a sophisticated

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:04.190
civilisation, complete with monumental architecture, advanced knowledge, and a thriving culture.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:12.220
In Fawcett’s mind, this lost civilisation became Z, the name he gave to the city

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:17.500
he believed would prove that the Amazon was once home to highly advanced societies.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:24.660
His conviction was fueled by reports of strange artefacts—like elaborately

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:29.880
carved pottery—and accounts of European explorers who claimed to have seen

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.090
vast settlements deep in the rainforest during searches for El Dorado.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:42.060
Before he could set out to look for Z, he was called back to Europe to fight in World War One.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:48.320
And it was on the battlefields of the Somme that he had something of a revelation.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:57.810
He was in his late 40s, and seeing these young men, many of whom were only 17 or 18, being sent

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:04.930
over the top, only to be mown down by machine gun fire seconds later, something changed in him.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.280
To Fawcett, the futility, the meaningless of it all, was a wake-up call.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.700
Was the West and “advanced” society really so much

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:21.505
more sophisticated if this was all it resulted in?

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:26.700
In those wet, muddy, bloody trenches of northern France, he became

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:31.040
even more convinced that he had to find this lost civilisation.

00:16:32.135 --> 00:16:36.810
But Fawcett’s desire to find Z wasn’t just a hunt for ruins—it

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:41.355
was a quest to redefine what we know about human civilisation.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.990
However, finding Z was no simple task.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.910
The Amazon is one of the most hostile environments on Earth, filled

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.520
with dangerous wildlife, treacherous terrain, tribes that are fiercely

00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.660
protective of their territory and diseases that can kill you within days.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.260
And 100 years ago, it was even more dangerous.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:11.200
Explorers had none of the life-saving technologies or medical assistance that they would today.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.490
Now, Fawcett had explored extensively through the

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.360
Amazon, so he was about as prepared as anyone could be.

00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:25.490
But he was now 57 years old; he was no spring chicken.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:32.170
In 1925, he embarked on what would be his final expedition, taking

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.540
with him his son Jack and Jack’s best friend, Raleigh Rimell.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:43.420
And fascinatingly, we do have quite a lot of evidence for the details of their trip.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:49.680
Every few days, he would write an update, which would be passed to a local runner, who

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.580
would take it back to a settlement where it could be typed up and sent via telegraph.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.391
So it was possible to follow the group’s movements in

00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:03.801
real-time, or at least, in real-time, but a few weeks delayed.

00:18:05.091 --> 00:18:09.861
In his last letter, which was written just after a month into the expedition,

00:18:10.211 --> 00:18:15.191
he described how the group was going to embark into uncharted territory.

00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:20.861
There was nothing particularly unusual about this; practically all the Amazon was

00:18:20.861 --> 00:18:26.111
uncharted at this point, and Fawcett was somewhat used to it, so it’s probably the

00:18:26.111 --> 00:18:30.741
equivalent of you or I saying, “I’m just going to the supermarket to get some milk”.

00:18:31.691 --> 00:18:37.091
In this letter, Fawcett wrote to his wife, “you have no fear of any failure”.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:43.222
Unfortunately, this is the last anyone has ever heard from them.

00:18:44.782 --> 00:18:50.942
Fawcett, his son and his friend vanished without a trace, never to be seen again.

00:18:52.432 --> 00:18:56.632
To many watching this expedition, it seemed very strange.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:19:01.602
Fawcett was a seasoned explorer, he had done this many times before.

00:19:02.472 --> 00:19:09.052
Despite the extreme difficulties of Amazonian exploration, Fawcett seemed practically invincible.

00:19:10.122 --> 00:19:11.192
What could have happened to him?

00:19:11.934 --> 00:19:15.504
Countless explorers have set off deep into the Amazon, trying

00:19:15.504 --> 00:19:19.584
to retrace Fawcett’s path and find some evidence of his fate.

00:19:20.674 --> 00:19:24.984
Many died in the search, so many in fact that the Brazilian

00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:30.194
government issued a decree in 1934 banning search parties for Fawcett.

00:19:30.624 --> 00:19:35.994
Tens of thousands of people have gone looking, but no evidence has been found.

00:19:37.274 --> 00:19:40.564
Over the years, countless theories have emerged about what

00:19:40.584 --> 00:19:45.164
happened to them, ranging from plausible to somewhat fantastical.

00:19:46.474 --> 00:19:52.484
Some say they were killed by hostile tribes; others say they succumbed to starvation or disease.

00:19:53.294 --> 00:20:00.154
There’s even speculation that Fawcett chose to disappear, perhaps integrating himself into a remote

00:20:00.184 --> 00:20:06.084
community in the jungle, or he got amnesia and believed himself to be a member of a local tribe.

00:20:07.104 --> 00:20:13.314
Or that he found Z, it wasn’t a lost ancient civilisation but one that was still

00:20:13.334 --> 00:20:19.414
flourishing, some kind of rainforest eutopia, so he decided to stay there forever.

00:20:20.484 --> 00:20:22.454
It seems we will never know.

00:20:23.194 --> 00:20:27.804
No remains of his body have ever been found, but most historians believe

00:20:27.814 --> 00:20:31.824
the most probable explanation is that he was killed by a local tribe.

00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:37.396
There are oral histories from Amazonian tribes that describe a man matching

00:20:37.396 --> 00:20:41.596
Fawcett’s description, at about the time that he disappeared, being killed.

00:20:42.836 --> 00:20:49.346
And as far as Z is concerned, there is some evidence that Fawcett might have been right, or at least

00:20:49.646 --> 00:20:54.836
onto something with his theory of an ancient civilisation hidden beneath the rainforest canopy.

00:20:56.126 --> 00:21:01.036
Since then, explorers have returned from the Amazon with remarkable findings:

00:21:01.326 --> 00:21:05.386
evidence of vast, interconnected settlements and advanced agricultural

00:21:05.386 --> 00:21:10.086
techniques that challenged the stereotype of the Amazon as a “green desert.”

00:21:11.056 --> 00:21:16.736
So, while he never found Z, or at least if he did, he never returned to tell the tale,

00:21:17.146 --> 00:21:22.346
his intuition about advanced Amazonian civilisations was certainly ahead of its time.

00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:24.859
Okay, then there we have it.

00:21:24.946 --> 00:21:28.356
we’ve reached the end of our journey into legendary lost cities.

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:34.666
Atlantis, El Dorado, and the City of Z might be very different stories, but they share

00:21:34.666 --> 00:21:39.856
a common thread: the idea that somewhere out there—hidden beneath the waves, buried in

00:21:39.856 --> 00:21:44.966
the jungle, or simply forgotten by time—there are mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

00:21:45.856 --> 00:21:48.826
So, are these stories fact or fiction?

00:21:49.746 --> 00:21:56.056
The sceptic would say pure fiction, the pragmatist might say fiction but with a smattering

00:21:56.056 --> 00:22:01.976
of fact, and the true believer might say we just haven’t looked in the right places.

00:22:03.499 --> 00:22:07.506
OK then, that is it for this exploration of the mysterious world

00:22:07.506 --> 00:22:11.566
of legendary lost cities and civilisations, and with that concludes

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:15.236
this three-part mini-series on the very loose theme of “mystery”.

00:22:15.809 --> 00:22:19.890
The thing about a mystery, or a secret, is that if it really is a secret then

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:24.520
nobody really knows about it, but I hope this was a fun exploration through

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:29.930
some secret themes, from secret societies to spycraft to secret lost cities.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.080
You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

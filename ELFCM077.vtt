Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:16.031
English, the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:21.391
and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:28.742
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about How International Post Works.

00:00:30.132 --> 00:00:37.392
It is the story of global cooperation, of countries coming together to agree something that is in

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:44.552
everyone’s advantage, and the creation of a system whereby anyone can send a little piece of paper

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:51.842
to almost anywhere in the world for, when you put it into perspective, a very small amount of money.

00:00:53.412 --> 00:00:57.792
So, let’s not waste a minute, and get started right away.

00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:05.642
In the era of constant connectivity, where we all have a little machine in our pockets with

00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:13.032
which we can contact anyone, anywhere in the world, instantly at any time, it’s easy to forget

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:19.592
about the magic of the postal system, and specifically, the international postal system.

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:25.462
People rarely send letters anymore, especially to different countries.

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:33.762
In the UK it’s still common only for a few things - you might send a letter

00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:39.542
for a special occasion - a birthday card, or a celebration of a new baby.

00:01:40.562 --> 00:01:48.552
However it has become a lot rarer, since we have a completely free, instant way of sending messages.

00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:53.102
When you think about it, though, the international postal

00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:57.662
system, when it actually works properly, is quite magical.

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:04.382
I can go to a post office, buy one single stamp, for less than the

00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:09.072
cost of a coffee, and I can send a letter to anywhere in the world.

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:16.972
I put that letter into a postbox, and magically it will make its way to whatever

00:02:16.972 --> 00:02:24.242
country I write on the outside, it’ll pass through different countries, but providing

00:02:24.262 --> 00:02:29.912
I have the right stamp on it, it will end up in the country I want it to, where

00:02:30.142 --> 00:02:35.552
it will get sent to the right region, then the right office, then it’ll be loaded

00:02:35.562 --> 00:02:42.252
into a van, and delivered, by hand, right to the letterbox of whoever I want it to.

00:02:43.982 --> 00:02:48.582
And for this service, I will pay a very small amount of money.

00:02:50.132 --> 00:02:57.302
If we are talking about just a letter, from Malta, which is, if you weren’t aware, a tiny island

00:02:57.312 --> 00:03:04.132
just south of Italy, in the middle of the Mediterranean, I would pay a maximum of 86 cents.

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:08.352
That is to the most expensive destination in the world.

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:14.582
To give you a comparison, a coffee in a cafe here is just

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:19.952
over 1 euro, and a Big Mac, if that helps, is about 4 euros.

00:03:21.172 --> 00:03:25.172
So, when you think about it, the cost of sending a letter is

00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:29.112
incredibly cheap, given the service that you actually receive.

00:03:30.052 --> 00:03:32.252
Or at least, I think it’s pretty cheap.

00:03:33.852 --> 00:03:39.132
So what we are going to do in today’s episode is explain how this

00:03:39.142 --> 00:03:44.352
international postal system works, how we got to this pretty amazing

00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:50.122
situation, and what the future might hold for the international postal system.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:54.792
Of course, the postal system didn’t always exist.

00:03:55.112 --> 00:03:56.312
Humans invented it.

00:03:57.132 --> 00:04:01.772
And one human in particular is credited with the invention of the

00:04:01.782 --> 00:04:06.592
modern postal system, or at least, the modern domestic postal system.

00:04:08.252 --> 00:04:13.262
That man’s name is Rowland Hill, later Sir Rowland Hill.

00:04:14.782 --> 00:04:20.062
He was born in Worcestershire, in the west of England, in 1795.

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:28.902
He was a fervent believer in the importance of access to information, that the

00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:35.012
thing holding back progress was the ease with which people could access information.

00:04:36.532 --> 00:04:43.212
He thought that newspapers should be cheaper, and that the educational system should be reformed.

00:04:44.062 --> 00:04:48.222
It was only through knowledge that people could develop their

00:04:48.252 --> 00:04:52.582
own ideas, engage with others, and push society forward.

00:04:54.182 --> 00:05:02.892
But where he saw the greatest opportunity for impact was on reforming England’s postal system.

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:12.062
Up until then, the postal system in England was inefficient, complicated, and full of fraud.

00:05:13.722 --> 00:05:18.712
If you wanted to send a letter to someone, it was the person receiving the

00:05:18.712 --> 00:05:23.232
letter, not you, the person who sent it, who would pay for the service.

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:29.412
And the price was far more complicated than it is today.

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:34.482
The cost was calculated based on the distance that the

00:05:34.482 --> 00:05:38.892
letter had traveled, and the number of sheets of paper.

00:05:39.762 --> 00:05:42.542
The more sheets, and the further the letter had to

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:46.042
go, the more it would cost the person receiving it.

00:05:47.562 --> 00:05:54.482
And it could end up being really expensive, so people would often try to cheat the system.

00:05:55.982 --> 00:06:00.472
Firstly, members of parliament were allowed to send letters for free.

00:06:01.222 --> 00:06:07.002
The system allowed for a member of parliament, an MP, to put a mark on the outside

00:06:07.022 --> 00:06:12.332
of a letter, and sign it, so that it was free for the person to receive it.

00:06:13.522 --> 00:06:18.342
The idea was that an MP should be able to contact their constituents,

00:06:18.622 --> 00:06:23.562
the people that they serve, but the system was ripe for abuse.

00:06:25.032 --> 00:06:30.572
What actually happened was MPs would sell their marks to businesses,

00:06:30.942 --> 00:06:36.482
allowing them to send letters for free - a huge abuse of the system.

00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:44.372
Secondly, which is actually something that I think is quite clever, is that if you just wanted to

00:06:44.372 --> 00:06:50.962
send a message to someone else, you could write in coded language on the outside of the letter.

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:57.622
So when the postman arrived with that letter, you could examine the outside of it,

00:06:57.862 --> 00:07:02.852
read the message, and then refuse delivery of it, so you didn’t have to pay for it.

00:07:04.402 --> 00:07:11.942
This system was evidently pretty inefficient, and Rowland Hill set to work on improving it.

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:17.982
He suggested a few things, which seemed revolutionary

00:07:18.002 --> 00:07:22.992
at the time, but might seem just ‘obvious’ to me or you.

00:07:24.492 --> 00:07:30.562
Firstly, that it was the sender, not the recipient who paid the cost.

00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:36.142
You would pay for the letter in advance by sticking something

00:07:36.142 --> 00:07:40.362
to the front of it - basically what we now know as a stamp.

00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:46.482
Secondly, he suggested that they simplified the price.

00:07:47.342 --> 00:07:52.732
He saw that most of the cost was actually in the sorting of the

00:07:52.732 --> 00:07:57.402
mail, not the distance it traveled, or the number of paper sheets.

00:07:57.982 --> 00:08:02.416
So the price would be based on weight, rather than distance.

00:08:04.036 --> 00:08:09.286
And thirdly, he proposed to drastically reduce the price.

00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:17.876
His view was that the price per letter would reduce, but the fact that it was cheaper would mean

00:08:17.876 --> 00:08:24.326
that more letters would be sent, and overall the postal service actually would make more money.

00:08:25.826 --> 00:08:33.316
As with any revolutionary idea, when it was first proposed, in 1837, it was

00:08:33.316 --> 00:08:40.156
considered ludicrous, denounced as one of Hill’s “wild and visionary schemes”.

00:08:41.796 --> 00:08:48.306
Hill was considered an eccentric, and this was another plan that would never work.

00:08:49.806 --> 00:08:57.356
But it did have strong support from merchants and bankers, who urged the government to adopt it.

00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:02.256
Hill’s scheme was an instant success.

00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:07.146
It was easier, cheaper, and less liable to fraud.

00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:12.136
The volume of letters shot up, with the number of letters sent, increased

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:23.436
drammatically, it shot up, going up by 120 percent from November 1839 to February 1840.

00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:30.626
Hill’s idea was quickly adopted by other countries, and the domestic

00:09:30.646 --> 00:09:35.106
postal system works in a pretty similar way to this present day.

00:09:36.606 --> 00:09:39.056
Yet there was still a problem.

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:48.056
What happened if you, as an Englishman in London let’s say, in 1870, wanted to send a letter

00:09:48.386 --> 00:09:54.826
to someone in another country, let’s say you wanted to send it to Rome, in Italy for example?

00:09:55.806 --> 00:09:58.606
Well, this was still very complicated.

00:09:59.456 --> 00:10:04.106
The letter that you wanted to send would, of course, have to travel

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:08.096
through multiple different countries to get to its final destination.

00:10:09.126 --> 00:10:14.266
And if you were just buying a stamp when you sent the letter, in England,

00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:18.826
the English postal service wouldn’t take that letter all the way to Rome.

00:10:20.096 --> 00:10:24.766
Depending on the route it took, it would have to pass through a

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:30.416
mixture of different countries - perhaps France, Belgium, Germany,

00:10:30.426 --> 00:10:35.601
Switzerland, Austria, and others, before it even got anywhere near Rome.

00:10:37.211 --> 00:10:44.461
Any agreements that countries had in terms of managing their international post were normally

00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:51.051
bilateral, they were between two countries, so you would have to send your post first to

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:56.881
someone in France, then they would have to forward it on to someone in Switzerland, and

00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:04.001
they would have to send it on to someone in Italy, to your eventual destination in Rome.

00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:07.671
There was no system in place for post to go from one

00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:11.451
country to another but to pass through another on the way.

00:11:12.911 --> 00:11:17.271
Obviously, that was a massive hassle, and very expensive.

00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:24.411
Yet now, I can send a letter from a small island in Europe to a small island in

00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:29.841
the Pacific for less than the cost of a cup of coffee, and it is incredibly easy.

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:31.601
What changed?

00:11:33.131 --> 00:11:38.541
Well, it was clear to everyone that this original system wasn’t going to work.

00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:41.631
But how could it be simplified?

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:50.391
In 1874, a congress was called, led by a man called Ernst Heinrich Wilhelm von Stephan.

00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:58.011
Von Stephan is the man credited with simplifying the German postal system, and he

00:11:58.021 --> 00:12:04.531
implemented and improved on a lot of the ideas that Hill had suggested in England.

00:12:06.111 --> 00:12:10.571
Von Stephan had a grand plan for how international postage should

00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:16.281
work, and he presented this plan to representatives from 22 countries.

00:12:17.931 --> 00:12:19.141
The plan was simple.

00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:27.821
Firstly, that there should be a uniform, flat rate to send a letter anywhere in the world.

00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:36.581
Secondly, the postal authorities should give equal treatment to foreign and domestic mail.

00:12:37.011 --> 00:12:39.501
They couldn’t prioritise the domestic post.

00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:42.721
Every letter should be treated the same.

00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:50.891
And thirdly, that each country should keep all money it has collected for international postage.

00:12:51.411 --> 00:12:57.738
So in my earlier example of sending a letter from England to Rome, the

00:12:57.748 --> 00:13:01.608
British postal service gets all of the money from the cost of the stamp.

00:13:02.148 --> 00:13:06.488
The French, German, Swiss, Italian, or whatever other

00:13:06.748 --> 00:13:09.988
postal services helped deliver the letter get nothing.

00:13:11.568 --> 00:13:14.608
Now, you might think, well that’s a bit unfair.

00:13:14.988 --> 00:13:20.638
Surely the British postal service should share some of that money, as they only did

00:13:20.638 --> 00:13:26.218
the easy part of collecting the letter and perhaps putting it on a ship to France.

00:13:26.228 --> 00:13:31.178
The reason that Von Stephan proposed this system, where

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:34.828
the sending country got all the money was quite simple.

00:13:35.758 --> 00:13:41.098
Firstly, it was simpler to not have to add up all of the costs and

00:13:41.098 --> 00:13:44.698
share them with each country that had been involved in the delivery.

00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:51.258
This would require a lot of administration, and therefore cost.

00:13:52.848 --> 00:14:00.458
But secondly, the idea was that each letter that was sent would receive a response, so in this

00:14:00.488 --> 00:14:07.165
example, your friend in Rome would write a letter back, in this case the Italian postal service

00:14:07.305 --> 00:14:12.315
would collect the money from the cost of the stamp, and the British one would get nothing.

00:14:12.825 --> 00:14:15.505
So it would all even itself out.

00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:23.205
And before you say, hang on, what about the French, German or Swiss postal service,

00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:29.855
yes, in this example they aren’t getting anything, but the expensive part of the postal

00:14:29.855 --> 00:14:35.225
system isn’t the bit in the middle, it’s the bit at the start and the bit at the end.

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:41.295
All of the countries at the congress accepted Von Stephan’s suggestions,

00:14:41.975 --> 00:14:47.445
and in 1874 something called the General Postal Union was formed.

00:14:48.525 --> 00:14:55.325
It quickly attracted countries from all over the world, and just 5 years later it changed its

00:14:55.325 --> 00:15:02.335
name to the Universal Postal Union, to reflect the fact that, well, it was almost universal.

00:15:03.895 --> 00:15:08.505
This system of only the sending country getting the money for postage

00:15:08.795 --> 00:15:13.365
was to prove a little problematic though, and certainly unfair.

00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:18.405
It benefited countries that sent more mail than they

00:15:18.405 --> 00:15:23.195
received, and for some countries, there was a large imbalance.

00:15:24.755 --> 00:15:30.165
In 1906 it was found that the Italian postal service was delivering

00:15:30.165 --> 00:15:38.645
325,000 magazines every year to addresses in Italy, yet a grand total

00:15:38.785 --> 00:15:43.955
of zero magazines were sent by the Italian postal service abroad.

00:15:45.555 --> 00:15:50.975
As a member of the Universal Postal Union, Italy had to deliver these in

00:15:50.975 --> 00:15:56.235
effect for free, and understandably, complained that the system wasn’t fair.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:06.512
However, for 53 years, the Universal Postal Union, the UPU, remained broadly unchanged.

00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:13.685
But as the process of decolonisation started to happen after the end

00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:20.165
of the Second World War, and these new countries joined the UPU they,

00:16:20.325 --> 00:16:25.245
like Italy, ended up receiving a lot more mail than they sent out.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:32.595
Richer countries, such as France, Britain, and US, were making money by

00:16:32.605 --> 00:16:37.307
sending much more letters than they received, and the poorer countries,

00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:42.087
these ex-colonies, were delivering the mail and not getting paid for it.

00:16:43.647 --> 00:16:47.597
They pushed for change, and there was enough pressure within

00:16:47.597 --> 00:16:53.417
the UPU to create a new system, called “terminal dues”.

00:16:54.827 --> 00:17:00.887
What this meant was that if there was an imbalance, a difference, between the weight

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:07.107
of the post sent and received between two countries, then one country had to pay

00:17:07.107 --> 00:17:13.857
the other an amount of money set by the UPU, based on how large the difference was.

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:18.967
It sounds like an improvement, and it definitely was to

00:17:18.967 --> 00:17:22.637
a certain extent, but there was another issue with this.

00:17:24.057 --> 00:17:29.977
The amount of money was the same for every country in the world, so the countries

00:17:29.997 --> 00:17:35.059
with low-cost postal services, either because they had low-cost labour, or

00:17:35.079 --> 00:17:40.259
because they were very efficient, they benefited from this, as they got more

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:45.329
money in compensation than it actually cost them to deliver the letters.

00:17:46.216 --> 00:17:53.313
If you receive a million dollars as compensation for delivering lots of post, but actually it only

00:17:53.313 --> 00:17:59.924
costs you $500,000 to deliver that post, well done, that's some profit for your postal service.

00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:07.536
This situation has, to a certain extent, now been improved countries

00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:11.956
are put into one of four different categories depending on how developed

00:18:11.956 --> 00:18:16.646
they are, and the categories pay different levels of terminal dues.

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:25.693
But the situation is still far from perfect, and there seems to be a perennial battle over

00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:32.263
what is the right amount of compensation for a country that delivers more mail than it sends.

00:18:34.003 --> 00:18:37.553
You may have heard Donald Trump complaining about the postal

00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:42.193
service, and this is partly because of the terminal dues system.

00:18:43.803 --> 00:18:47.663
The United States threatened to withdraw from the UPU.

00:18:47.663 --> 00:18:54.633
the Universal Postal Union, in 2018, as it claimed it was subsidising

00:18:54.813 --> 00:18:59.533
the cost of packages that arrived from abroad, particularly from China.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:07.257
The Americans demanded a system of self-declaration, where it decided how

00:19:07.257 --> 00:19:13.837
much to charge foreign postal services to deliver their post, not the UPU.

00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:21.327
An American exit from the UPU would have been very disruptive to the global economy.

00:19:22.247 --> 00:19:29.057
The country handles about half of the world’s mail, and the UPU didn’t have much of a choice.

00:19:30.647 --> 00:19:38.867
So, pressed against the wall, it agreed to the US requests, and from July 2020 the US

00:19:38.897 --> 00:19:44.217
will be allowed to set its own rates that it charges foreign postal services, but these

00:19:44.217 --> 00:19:50.707
rates can be a maximum of 70 percent of the domestic cost, the cost within that country.

00:19:52.207 --> 00:19:58.657
Naturally, this cost is going to be passed on to consumers, and some have said that the

00:19:58.707 --> 00:20:04.677
era of ultra-low cost shipping from places like China to America is going to be over.

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:12.127
And if, instead of buying an iPhone case from China for $5 with free shipping, it’s going to

00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:19.307
be $5 and $5 for the shipping, suddenly that iPhone case becomes slightly less attractive.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.132
It’s surely a good thing for the United States manufacturing

00:20:24.132 --> 00:20:27.632
industry, as suddenly it becomes a lot more competitive.

00:20:29.222 --> 00:20:34.062
But whether it is a good thing for the consumer is another question altogether.

00:20:35.662 --> 00:20:40.872
Certainly Sir Rowland Hill, the inventor of the modern postal service as we know

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:45.932
it, wouldn’t be particularly happy to see the direction the UPU is going in.

00:20:46.902 --> 00:20:52.142
A more complicated system that raises the cost of the postal system was

00:20:52.192 --> 00:20:57.852
everything he stood against, and I imagine that he would be turning in his grave.

00:21:00.202 --> 00:21:05.272
OK then, that is it for how the international postal system works.

00:21:05.752 --> 00:21:13.162
It might be a system that has been around for almost 150 years, and it might just seem ‘normal’ to

00:21:13.162 --> 00:21:19.988
me or you, but when you think about what it took to get here, I do think it is pretty impressive.

00:21:21.418 --> 00:21:24.628
As always, please do let me know what you think of the show.

00:21:25.148 --> 00:21:29.678

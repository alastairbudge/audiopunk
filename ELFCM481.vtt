Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:16.005
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:20.065
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:25.565
I'm Alastair Budge, and today is part two of our philosophical mini-series.

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:31.367
In part one, in case you missed it, we talked about the innermost thoughts of Marcus Aurelius.

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:36.935
In part three we are going to talk about the queen of capitalism and self-interest,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:42.135
Ayn Rand, and in today’s episode, part two, we are going to talk about the

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:47.695
prince of pessimism, the 19th century German philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer.

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:53.265
They are three pretty unrelated philosophers and thinkers, so you can quite

00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:57.005
happily listen to this episode without having listened to the previous one.

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:03.505
So, let’s not waste a minute, and learn about Mr Gloomy, Arthur Schopenhauer.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:09.975
Philosophers throughout history have grappled with life’s big questions.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:12.255
What is man’s purpose?

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:14.445
What is the nature of humanity?

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:16.025
What is knowledge?

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.445
What is right, and what is wrong?

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:22.225
Ultimately, what is the meaning of life?

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:29.605
As you heard in the last episode, Marcus Aurelius had an answer, or at least, he

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:35.615
had a perspective on what actions and behaviours would result in a life well-lived.

00:01:36.415 --> 00:01:40.715
Virtue, integrity, and duty were all key factors.

00:01:41.445 --> 00:01:48.965
Do as nature intended you to do, be a good person, that is what humans were put on this earth to do.

00:01:50.415 --> 00:01:55.645
It’s therefore perhaps unsurprising that there is a renaissance of Marcus Aurelius

00:01:55.645 --> 00:02:01.845
fans, that his ideas have become so popular almost 2000 years after his death.

00:02:02.595 --> 00:02:10.655
They are nice, practical, easy to understand, and in their own way, positive and joyful.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.695
One philosopher who has not enjoyed such a renaissance, and whose conclusions on the meaning of

00:02:18.695 --> 00:02:25.265
life are anything but positive and playful, is the subject of today’s episode, Arthur Schopenhauer.

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:31.895
He spent his life obsessed with the question not of how to live an honourable life,

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:39.385
but of death, evil, destruction, violence, and the futility of man’s existence.

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:45.215
We will go into his philosophy in detail in a moment, but first we need

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:49.175
to talk a bit about his personal life, as there are several events that

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:54.385
one imagines might have contributed to this gloomy outlook on life.

00:02:55.705 --> 00:02:59.965
Schopenhauer was born in 1788 in Gdansk.

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:05.715
As you may know, Gdansk is in modern day Poland, but in

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:09.745
1788 it was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:17.655
Schopenhauer's father was a wealthy merchant, and although the young Arthur Shopenhauer didn’t

00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:23.415
really want to follow in his father’s footsteps, he felt the pressure to join the family business.

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:30.456
He travelled around Europe to learn the craft, in preparation for his future career as a merchant.

00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:38.535
But in 1805, when he was 17 years old, his prospects changed dramatically.

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:44.355
His father was found dead, drowned in a canal, with

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:47.225
his mother concluding that he had committed suicide.

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.855
Clearly, on an emotional level this must have been a

00:03:51.855 --> 00:03:54.705
very difficult thing for the teenage boy to deal with.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:59.905
But on a practical level, this left the young Schopenhauer with a

00:03:59.935 --> 00:04:05.385
considerable inheritance, and the ability–if he so chose–to pursue a

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:09.655
life of thought and reflection rather than to have to go into business.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:16.005
He did follow a merchant career for a few years, but then switched paths,

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:20.645
enrolling at the University of Gottingen to study medicine, before switching to

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:25.695
a more philosophical track, first at Gottingen and then at University of Berlin.

00:04:27.015 --> 00:04:30.845
We’ll talk more about his academic career and his writings in a minute,

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:36.115
but first, let’s ask ourselves what we know about Schopenhauer as a man.

00:04:37.675 --> 00:04:40.745
We know that he was a difficult person to be around.

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:44.665
He had a terrible, strained relationship with his mother.

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:51.655
This was the case throughout his childhood, but it was even more so after she entered

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:56.625
into a new relationship after her husband, Schopenhauer’s father, killed himself.

00:04:57.915 --> 00:05:01.425
We can see this in a letter she sent her son, where she

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:05.165
doesn’t mince her words, she doesn’t speak in indirect terms.

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:10.597
" You are unbearable and burdensome and very hard to live with.

00:05:11.317 --> 00:05:16.657
All your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit and made useless to the world

00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:21.219
simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people."

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.950
In other words, he was proud and difficult, not an easy person to like.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.720
And to think, this was coming from his own mother!

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.570
From his  journals, you can also get a sense of his

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.630
arrogance and the belief that he was superior to others.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.490
In one note from his time at university, he described how much he wanted to point a pistol

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.110
at his professor’s chest and ask him to clarify his nonsensical thoughts before shooting him.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.910
This professor was a famous philosopher called Johann Gottlieb Fichte, who was one of the reasons

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:09.250
that Schopenhauer had switched from Gottingen to Berlin, but Schopenhauer soon grew impatient and

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.880
bored of his professor’s thoughts, believing that he, the student, was superior intellectually.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.740
And, as you heard, he wrote that he wanted to shoot him.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.200
He was clearly not a modest young man, and believed that he was the

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.210
intellectual equal of great figures in German philosophy, both dead and alive.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.970
The problem was, it seemed that the only person who was able to

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.030
truly appreciate Schopenahuer’s genius was Schopenhauer himself.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.710
So, it was time to publish his ideas, so the world could truly

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.220
appreciate Schopenhauer for the genius that he knew he was.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.900
In 1818, he published his first and most famous book, Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.340
or The World as Will and Representation as it’s normally translated in English.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.610
In this book, in The World as Will and Representation, a central theme is Schopenhauer both

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.390
challenging and building on the ideas of the eighteenth century philosopher Immanuel Kant.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.650
One of Kant’s most important ideas was that humans perceive

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.270
the world through our own experience and intuition.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.900
We are unable to access the true nature of things, according to Kant,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.500
because we experience everything through our intuition and experience.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:48.520
Things that we take as real, like space and time, were not empirical realities, according

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:54.900
to Kant, but rather ways in which humans perceive and therefore understand the world.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.280
Although they seem real to us, they do not truly exist independently of humans.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:05.600
Kant called these “phenomena”

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.160
And according to Kant, beyond these phenomena were something called

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.610
“noumena”, the things in themself, the things that humans can never know or

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.420
understand, because we can only access the world through our own intuition.

00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:26.304
Schopenhauer wasn’t happy with this explanation.

00:08:26.924 --> 00:08:31.594
He wanted to better, to go beyond, his intellectual hero Kant.

00:08:32.284 --> 00:08:37.724
He claimed he had discovered the elusive thing-in-itself, the real core behind

00:08:37.774 --> 00:08:42.504
all our perceptions that Kant said could never be discovered by human beings.

00:08:43.774 --> 00:08:49.294
This thing was something that he called ‘will’, or “Wille” in German.

00:08:50.794 --> 00:08:55.824
And I have to warn you, what he found wasn’t particularly uplifting.

00:08:57.034 --> 00:09:01.954
Schopenhauer defined will as a purposeless and never-ending

00:09:02.164 --> 00:09:06.824
striving for change, which is the cause of all human suffering.

00:09:07.334 --> 00:09:13.874
It lay at the essence of every part of nature, every object, every human thought and desire.

00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:20.554
In other words, at the core of humanity is something with no meaning, with

00:09:20.564 --> 00:09:25.494
humans existing in a world where nothing is ever settled or satisfied.

00:09:26.874 --> 00:09:31.024
This, I imagine you’ll agree, is a pretty pessimistic outlook.

00:09:32.014 --> 00:09:35.724
But the idea of will was useful for Schopenhauer,

00:09:36.063 --> 00:09:39.334
who was above all interested in the problem of evil.

00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:46.244
Will explained why there is always conflict, pain, and suffering in the world.

00:09:47.084 --> 00:09:51.714
By understanding will as the force behind everything, Schopenhauer

00:09:52.054 --> 00:09:55.544
showed that evil and struggle are natural parts of human life.

00:09:56.784 --> 00:10:02.104
He did, however, offer a way out from the sorrowful nature of reality.

00:10:03.084 --> 00:10:07.614
He said that by rejecting will, humans could escape

00:10:07.694 --> 00:10:10.524
from the restless dissatisfaction of the universe.

00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:17.784
There were several ways that one could do this: by achieving a mental composure through recognising

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:24.354
that suffering is everywhere and endless, or through self-discipline to master one’s own will.

00:10:25.414 --> 00:10:28.814
You could do this by appreciating great art or beauty,

00:10:29.204 --> 00:10:32.344
which allowed you to temporarily silence the will.

00:10:33.094 --> 00:10:38.484
You could reject materialism and worldly pleasures, which would result in minimising

00:10:38.484 --> 00:10:43.674
complexity and therefore suffering, loosening the grip of the will on your existence.

00:10:44.904 --> 00:10:49.354
Ultimately, life was painful, but Schopenhauer did offer

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:52.914
some solutions as to how we could minimise this pain.

00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:59.754
Obviously, not very uplifting, but an apt view of life for a man who

00:10:59.754 --> 00:11:04.144
lived a pretty miserable and isolated personal and professional life.

00:11:05.524 --> 00:11:11.104
Now, despite his disdain for his contemporaries, Schopenhauer found unexpected

00:11:11.124 --> 00:11:15.964
inspiration and validation from an entirely different philosophical tradition:

00:11:16.704 --> 00:11:22.304
Buddhism and Hinduism, which he admired and thought explained suffering well.

00:11:23.814 --> 00:11:26.074
You may have heard of the word Nirvanā.

00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:30.514
It‘s a concept in many Eastern religions, including Buddhism

00:11:30.554 --> 00:11:35.314
and Hinduism, where the self is annihilated, it is destroyed.

00:11:36.624 --> 00:11:42.544
The person who attains this perfect mental state is liberated from the endless

00:11:42.574 --> 00:11:47.354
cycle of change, destruction, and creation that characterises the world.

00:11:48.604 --> 00:11:55.014
It is very similar to Schopenhauer’s idea of ‘denial of the will’ – a state where humans

00:11:55.024 --> 00:12:00.954
had transcended suffering by rejecting the world’s natural state of striving and change.

00:12:02.114 --> 00:12:05.554
When he read about this and made the link, probably at

00:12:05.564 --> 00:12:08.894
Gottingen, it was a big personal victory for Schopenhauer.

00:12:09.805 --> 00:12:15.230
At this time in Germany, Eastern philosophies, and in particular the Hindu tradition,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.840
had taken on great prestige and authority, they had started to be held in high regard.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:28.110
The reason for this was the discovery of Sanskrit, an ancient literary language from the region.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:35.420
Linguists realised that European languages had many links to Sanskrit, which

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.180
led many writers and philosophers to believe that ancient Indian civilisation

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.860
was the origin of all later cultures, including Christian European culture.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.970
This gave classical Indian ideas a reputation for holding a universal

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:57.410
wisdom that had been lost to history, so finding an idea similar to the

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.830
destruction of the will in Buddhism gave Schopenhauer’s idea more authority.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.720
Now, although Schopenhauer wasn’t conventionally a religious man, he

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.010
thought a lot about religion, both European and non-European, because

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.640
he thought that there was little separating it from philosophy.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.030
Religion was just another way of trying to understand

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.400
the world and especially the suffering it contained.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:31.580
But because religion explored profound questions in the form of metaphor

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.360
and fables, it was the philosopher’s job to state its ideas more clearly.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.550
It was Schopenhauer’s job, and his fellow philosophers’ job.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.930
But of course, philosophers do not always agree.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.510
And we cannot talk about Schopenhauer without mentioning

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.060
his colleague and nemesis, the more successful Hegel.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.110
To begin with, the two men had very different interpretations of the world.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.820
Hegel saw everything that existed as rational, defined

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.050
by an essence that he called the “Absolute Idea’.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.760
Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed that reason was one of

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.210
the many illusions, or representations, that human beings perceived.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.270
It was not the true nature of reality.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.510
Remember that he believed the essence of reality was

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.470
“will”, which was purposeless and not guided by rationality.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:37.510
And this was not a friendly rivalry of sparring partners who would meet to

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:42.060
discuss their ideas and provide constructive criticism on each other’s work.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.260
Schopenhauer’s criticism of Hegel, who was Germany’s most celebrated

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.310
thinker after Kant’s death in 1804, was personal and vindictive.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.360
Schopenhauer was not afraid to express his dislike of others and once said that

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:02.900
anyone who read Hegel’s work without feeling like they were in a madhouse–a

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:07.900
lunatic asylum–should themselves be diagnosed with a psychological disorder.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.470
As you can imagine, this vindictiveness and arrogance

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.250
did not win him friends among fellow philosophers.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:21.980
He was so unpopular that he even failed to win an essay contest where he

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.180
was the only entrant, he was the only person who entered the competition.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:32.790
He had made it clear when he submitted his essay that he expected to win the competition, but

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.060
The Royal Danish Society, which was sponsoring the competition said, “sorry Schopenhauer, nope”

00:15:40.443 --> 00:15:44.183
And when news of him failing to win a competition in

00:15:44.183 --> 00:15:47.843
which he was the only participant got out, he was furious.

00:15:48.693 --> 00:15:53.363
He spent a lot of the introduction to his next book ranting, complaining,

00:15:53.564 --> 00:15:57.523
about The Royal Danish Society, as well as the hated Fichte and Hegel.

00:15:58.823 --> 00:16:03.523
Given his prickly, difficult, personality, it‘s no surprise that

00:16:03.523 --> 00:16:06.803
Schopenhauer was a very solitary person throughout his life.

00:16:07.696 --> 00:16:11.103
He had many short-lived affairs, one of which produced

00:16:11.103 --> 00:16:14.433
an illegitimate child, but he never married or settled.

00:16:15.753 --> 00:16:22.733
Slowly, in the 1840s, he gathered a small group of supporters whom he referred to as his ‘apostles’.

00:16:23.703 --> 00:16:29.383
They were not philosophers but rather professional men, mostly lawyers, who kept track

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:34.363
of references to his work in the press and published essays in defence of his philosophy.

00:16:35.869 --> 00:16:40.403
At the same time, he had been spending years trying to convince publishers

00:16:40.593 --> 00:16:44.643
to bring out a second edition of The World as Will and Representation.

00:16:45.773 --> 00:16:50.073
In 1844, aged 56, he finally succeeded.

00:16:51.143 --> 00:16:55.243
To his disappointment, the second edition was not any more successful than the

00:16:55.243 --> 00:16:59.803
first edition and there were lots of negative reviews in scholarly journals.

00:17:01.213 --> 00:17:07.253
His big break, if we can call it that, came late in 1853 with a positive

00:17:07.253 --> 00:17:10.623
review in the prestigious British journal The Westminster Review.

00:17:11.483 --> 00:17:14.923
People finally began travelling to see him speak, perhaps

00:17:14.923 --> 00:17:19.623
now, in his 60s, people had started to wise up to his genius.

00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:24.283
The universities of Bonn and Breslau started giving lectures on his

00:17:24.283 --> 00:17:29.853
philosophy and in 1856 the University of Leipzig honoured his work

00:17:30.023 --> 00:17:34.383
by sponsoring a prize contest for the best essays on his philosophy.

00:17:35.453 --> 00:17:39.883
Of course, the ever-critical Schopenhauer did not approve of the winning entry.

00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:48.763
In 1860, aged 72, Schopenhauer began suffering heart palpitations and fainting fits.

00:17:49.483 --> 00:17:55.103
He knew that he was dying but this did not weaken his characteristic defiance.

00:17:55.903 --> 00:17:59.603
To the end, Schopenhauer stuck by his philosophical principles.

00:18:00.363 --> 00:18:05.733
He had argued in his work that death could never be a complete annihilation because,

00:18:06.193 --> 00:18:10.943
like all the perceptions that we humans have of the physical world, it was unreal.

00:18:12.343 --> 00:18:18.796
On September the 18th, 1860, Schopenhauer told a visitor that he did not fear death

00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:23.733
but rather what philosophy professors would do with his work after he was gone.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:28.607
He died on September the 26th of 1860.

00:18:29.797 --> 00:18:34.927
As he had predicted, his final escape from the world of suffering was not the end.

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:38.577
His reputation grew over the following century.

00:18:39.007 --> 00:18:42.827
Albert Einstein called him a genius for his work on ethics and

00:18:42.987 --> 00:18:47.427
admired him greatly, even having his portrait hung on his office wall.

00:18:49.077 --> 00:18:53.707
As to his legacy more broadly, he was one of the earliest prominent Western

00:18:53.707 --> 00:18:58.667
philosophers to seriously engage with Hindu and Buddhist traditions and can

00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:02.587
be credited with helping to introduce these ideas to Western philosophy.

00:19:03.997 --> 00:19:09.117
Yes, German and European intellectuals were interested in classical Indian culture.

00:19:09.627 --> 00:19:12.947
However, most of them approached Indian literature and

00:19:12.947 --> 00:19:16.577
philosophy from an anthropological or literary perspective.

00:19:17.477 --> 00:19:23.517
Schopenhauer uniquely integrated these ideas into his own philosophical framework, saying

00:19:23.517 --> 00:19:29.047
that ideas in Indian philosophy could actually help Europeans understand the world better.

00:19:30.177 --> 00:19:36.347
Grumpy and not particularly fun to be around, he surely was, but his unique synthesis

00:19:36.547 --> 00:19:42.437
of Western and Eastern thought, and his insights into the role of human will in driving

00:19:42.437 --> 00:19:47.757
suffering, have cemented his importance as an influential voice in modern philosophy.

00:19:49.367 --> 00:19:53.237
OK then, that is it for Arthur Schopenhauer, a man for whom

00:19:53.237 --> 00:19:56.877
life had no meaning, but a man who certainly left his mark.

00:19:57.767 --> 00:20:00.687
As always, I would love to know what you thought about this episode.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:02.527
Have you read much Schopenhauer?

00:20:02.807 --> 00:20:04.127
Are you one of his apostles?

00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:06.823
What do you think we can learn from his gloominess?

00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:12.297

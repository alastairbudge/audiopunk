Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:15.622
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.622 --> 00:00:19.462
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:19.962 --> 00:00:22.952
I'm Alastair Budge, and today we are going to be talking

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:27.102
about the amazing story of The Affair Of The Diamond Necklace.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:31.752
If you've been paying very close attention, you might remember this being

00:00:31.762 --> 00:00:37.632
mentioned in passing in episode number 429, on the life of Marie Antoinette.

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:41.512
But in today’s episode we are going to go a lot deeper into

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:45.372
this fascinating story, that sounds almost too good to be true.

00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.622
It brings together queens, cardinals, prostitutes,

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:54.562
con artists, diamonds, forgery, theft, and revolution.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:59.385
OK then, the affair of the diamond necklace.

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:07.635
You probably know the 1952 song by Marilyn Monroe, Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend.

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:09.185
It starts like this:

00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:12.405
The French are glad to die for love

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.395
They delight in fighting duels

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:16.885
But I prefer a man who lives

00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:19.075
And gives expensive jewels

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:25.865
Exactly 180 years before that song was released, the most powerful man in

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:31.545
France did not die for love nor did he delight in fighting duels, but he

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:36.665
did decide to give a woman he loved the most expensive jewels imaginable.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:45.035
Louis XV, the king of France, had a mistress with particularly expensive taste, Madame du Barry.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:50.725
He wanted to do something completely over the top, and give her

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:54.625
a piece of jewellery that blew everything else out of the water.

00:01:55.895 --> 00:02:02.835
He called for the finest jewellers in Europe, Charles Auguste Boehmer and Paul Bassenge, and

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:12.995
commissioned a vast diamond necklace containing 650 diamonds and weighing almost 2,800 carats.

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:19.225
Even if you are not a diamond connoisseur, you might have some idea that that sounds like

00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:25.325
a lot, but let me give you a few more details for you to truly understand the scale of it.

00:02:26.205 --> 00:02:32.175
It weighed over half a kilo, half a kilo of diamonds to hang around your neck.

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:38.455
Even today, in the age of multibillionaires, the most expensive diamond

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:44.945
necklace in the world is 383 carats, so this necklace was more than

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:50.425
7 times more luxurious than the most expensive one that exists today.

00:02:51.295 --> 00:02:57.305
It was vast, a huge collection of diamonds so ostentatious, so over the top,

00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:02.585
that its purpose was to scream “look at me, look at how expensive this is”.

00:03:03.685 --> 00:03:09.145
The cost was 2 million livres, which is around €15 million in today’s money.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:16.055
The jewellers started work on it, procuring the diamonds with a small down payment from the king.

00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:23.795
Sourcing the rest of the diamonds was very expensive and took a long time, several years, because

00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:29.455
the jewellers had to save up and go into debt to pay for the raw material, for the diamonds.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.795
But this was the cost of doing business.

00:03:33.395 --> 00:03:38.755
After all, the king had ordered it, and when the necklace was complete he would

00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:44.065
settle the bill quickly and the two jewellers would be in for a huge payday.

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:50.525
However, before the necklace could be completed, Louis XV died.

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:57.365
When the throne passed to Louis’s grandson, Louis XVI, the jewellers hoped that they could sell the

00:03:57.365 --> 00:04:04.225
necklace to his wife, Marie Antoinette, who had a bit of a reputation for the finer things in life.

00:04:05.275 --> 00:04:07.955
But she was having none of it.

00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:15.205
Firstly, she strongly disliked the original intended recipient of the necklace, her husband’s

00:04:15.225 --> 00:04:20.555
grandfather’s mistress, so she didn’t want to wear the jewellery of a woman she despised.

00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:25.355
Secondly the mood had changed in France.

00:04:26.225 --> 00:04:33.205
Sure, Marie Antoinette was no stranger to luxury, but even she could understand that wandering

00:04:33.235 --> 00:04:39.795
around in half a kilo of diamonds while revolutionary fever was brewing might not be the best idea.

00:04:41.285 --> 00:04:44.955
She was offered the necklace multiple times, by the jewellers

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:49.425
directly and by her husband, but each time she rejected it.

00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:53.835
So, the jewellers were in a bit of a bind.

00:04:54.555 --> 00:04:58.155
They had this huge necklace worth literally millions,

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.625
but it was so expensive that nobody could afford it.

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:06.395
They had to wait, bide their time in the hope that Marie Antoinette

00:05:06.465 --> 00:05:10.415
would change her mind, or that someone else might come along who

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:14.265
might have pockets deep enough to take the necklace of their hands.

00:05:15.555 --> 00:05:19.255
And it’s here that we must meet another character in our story.

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:22.725
Her name was Jeanne de Valois-Saint-Rémy.

00:05:23.725 --> 00:05:31.535
She was born in 1756, so was a direct contemporary of Marie Antoinette, who was born a year earlier.

00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:40.155
Jeanne’s mother was a servant, of low social status, but her father was a descendant of an

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:46.605
illegitimate son of Henry II, Henry The Second in English, the 16th century French king.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:52.154
Despite her father’s claims of nobility, the family had no money.

00:05:52.864 --> 00:05:56.654
Jeanne’s father would tell anyone who would listen about his supposed

00:05:56.884 --> 00:06:01.774
noble lineage, in the hope that someone would put in a good word, and he

00:06:01.774 --> 00:06:06.524
would be given land, a title, and the allowance that he felt he was owed.

00:06:07.584 --> 00:06:08.434
It didn’t work.

00:06:08.774 --> 00:06:16.254
He was rebuffed at every turn, and his children–including Jeanne–were forced to beg on the streets.

00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:21.504
When begging, the children were told to tell people about their noble

00:06:21.514 --> 00:06:25.714
lineage, asking people to take pity on someone with noble blood.

00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:29.354
This, in fact, did work.

00:06:30.084 --> 00:06:33.864
The children caught the eye of an elderly noblewoman who took them

00:06:33.904 --> 00:06:38.064
under her wing, and vowed to help them win back their royal title.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.140
After a genealogist was consulted, Jeanne was confirmed as an illegitimate descendant

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.360
of Henry II, given a small monthly allowance, and sent to a boarding school.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.305
Her life’s trajectory had changed, and she vowed to make the most of it.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.420
Jeanne grew into a strong, brave and outgoing woman, and–like her father–she

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.000
was not afraid to tell anyone who would listen about her noble blood.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.630
She got married to an officer called Nicolas de la Motte, and the pair started

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:19.530
calling themselves “Comte et Comtesses de la Motte Valois”, count or countess.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.510
And, just in case you are unfamiliar with how aristocratic titles work, you

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.060
can’t just call yourself “Count”, if you don’t inherit it from a parent,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.470
you needed to be granted that title, typically by the ruling monarch.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.640
But Jeanne, as you’ll come to find out, was never one to

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.170
let real world restrictions get in the way of ambition.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.500
As long as she called herself a countess, she behaved and lived like

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.506
a countess, then people would believe that she was indeed a countess.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.670
The first problem was that being a countess is expensive.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.520
You have to maintain a certain lifestyle, and she was

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.260
unable to do that on her officer husband’s modest salary.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.710
She wanted to ask Marie Antoinette directly if she would support giving her a larger

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:15.859
allowance, as a member of the nobility, but Marie Antoinette wouldn’t even meet with her.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.050
She had heard rumours about Jeanne’s lifestyle, and didn’t want to be

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.390
associated with someone who had an “unorthodox” life, shall we say.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.430
See, despite being married, Jeanne was having an open affair with

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.310
one of her husband’s friends, a man called Rétaux de Villette.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:41.130
And this affair was tolerated and perhaps even encouraged by her husband.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.120
Marie Antoinette had no interest in associating herself

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.370
with this woman, and refused all of Jeanne’s advances.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.030
So, she tried a different approach.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:02.451
Sometime in the mid 1780s, she met a Cardinal, a senior church official, called Cardinal de Rohan.

00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:08.470
The cardinal was older than Jeanne, he was in his 50s, and he had developed

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.460
a reputation for indulging in some not particularly church-like behaviours.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.010
Specifically, he was known to have affairs, despite

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.520
having taken a vow of chastity, of being celibate.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:27.580
He also lived a life of huge luxury, spending vast amounts of money.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:34.240
He was also power hungry, he sought to have a greater influence in the world of French politics.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:40.449
The problem was that he too was out of favour with Marie Antoinette.

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:44.679
Not only had he spread rumours about the French queen,

00:09:45.139 --> 00:09:48.449
but he had made fun of her mother at a dinner party.

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:54.529
Marie Antoinette had never forgiven him, swearing to have nothing to do with him.

00:09:56.029 --> 00:10:01.179
As a senior church official, he had baptised her children, but she reportedly looked

00:10:01.219 --> 00:10:06.619
away from him for the entire service, such was the disdain that she held for him.

00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:15.529
Jeanne met the cardinal, and despite being 20 years his junior, the two soon became lovers.

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:21.459
Now, the extent to which this was true love or whether it was Jeanne

00:10:21.469 --> 00:10:26.219
using the cardinal, or perhaps even the cardinal using Jeanne, is unknown.

00:10:26.989 --> 00:10:31.209
As we’ll see, it seemed like it could be an advantageous alliance for both of them.

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:35.839
Jeanne told the Cardinal that she was friendly with Marie

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:40.179
Antoinette, and that she could help him win back her favour.

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:44.829
The problem was Jeanne was not friendly with Marie Antoinette.

00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:46.369
She had never even met her.

00:10:47.639 --> 00:10:52.609
But this small detail wasn’t going to derail Jeanne’s plan.

00:10:53.989 --> 00:10:59.849
She told the Cardinal that she, Jeanne, would act as a go-between between

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:04.459
him and Marie Antoinette, she would put in a good word about the cardinal

00:11:04.539 --> 00:11:09.299
and slowly slowly, he could restore his relationship with the queen.

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:14.242
A letter exchange is formed, the Cardinal writes Marie Antoinette

00:11:14.242 --> 00:11:18.362
letters, gives them to Jeanne to pass to Marie Antoinette, and then

00:11:18.372 --> 00:11:21.672
Jeanne brings back a letter from Marie Antoinette to the Cardinal.

00:11:23.046 --> 00:11:28.706
The letters start off cold, with Marie Antoinette distant and unfriendly.

00:11:30.177 --> 00:11:32.547
And then she makes an odd request.

00:11:33.727 --> 00:11:36.867
Marie Antoinette, in one of the letters, writes that

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:39.067
she needs to know that she can trust the cardinal.

00:11:40.047 --> 00:11:46.347
She would like his help in transferring 60,000 francs to help a friend in financial distress.

00:11:47.577 --> 00:11:53.697
Marie Antoinette could ask the king but she doesn't want to tell him about this, and if the Cardinal

00:11:53.777 --> 00:11:59.727
could help, this would be most appreciated and show that he was serious about their relationship.

00:12:00.847 --> 00:12:06.597
So, the Cardinal agrees, and duly gives Jeanne the money to give to Marie Antoinette.

00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:12.587
Marie Antoinette writes back that she was most thankful, and she seems to

00:12:12.587 --> 00:12:17.557
warm up to the cardinal, becoming friendly and warm in her correspondence.

00:12:18.517 --> 00:12:21.097
After this, there were further requests for money.

00:12:21.647 --> 00:12:27.167
It seemed that Marie Antoinette didn’t have a lot of cash on hand, and she would often ask the

00:12:27.177 --> 00:12:33.477
Cardinal for a few thousands francs here and there to give to charity or to give a friend, or so on.

00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:39.527
But, as you can probably imagine, these letters were not from Marie Antoinette.

00:12:40.437 --> 00:12:43.997
Jeanne’s lover, Rétaux de Villette, was an expert

00:12:44.074 --> 00:12:47.547
forger, skilled at copying other people’s handwriting.

00:12:48.675 --> 00:12:52.557
Jeanne would stand and dictate the letters, and he would

00:12:52.557 --> 00:12:56.647
write them, signing them as if he were Marie Antoinette.

00:12:57.737 --> 00:13:00.547
And of course the money never went to the queen.

00:13:01.207 --> 00:13:06.827
It was all an elaborate con from Jeanne, who used the money to buy a townhouse, to buy

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:12.507
dresses and furniture, to pay for the noble life that she felt she was entitled to.

00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:18.937
The cardinal had no idea, and what’s more, he even started to

00:13:18.937 --> 00:13:21.987
believe that Marie Antoinette was falling in love with him.

00:13:22.847 --> 00:13:28.177
She wrote in such a sensuous manner that he felt the French queen was urging him on.

00:13:29.557 --> 00:13:35.547
The problem was that in public Marie Antoinette showed no sign of affection towards the cardinal.

00:13:36.147 --> 00:13:41.587
Her look was cold, she never acknowledged him in public, and it seemed that nothing had changed.

00:13:43.167 --> 00:13:48.807
Jeanne started to get nervous, fearing that this ruse, this trick, would be

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:52.677
discovered if the Cardinal ever asked Marie Antoinette about it in public.

00:13:53.807 --> 00:13:56.177
So, she came up with another trick.

00:13:57.097 --> 00:14:02.217
She decided to arrange a meeting between Marie Antoinette and the cardinal in

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:06.597
the gardens of Versailles, the royal residence, in the middle of the night.

00:14:07.727 --> 00:14:15.017
The cardinal was ecstatic, and brought a rose to give to the queen as a gesture of his love for her.

00:14:16.407 --> 00:14:19.907
In the middle of the night, he arrived at the secret meeting and threw

00:14:19.907 --> 00:14:23.987
himself down at the feet of a woman he believed to be Marie Antoinette.

00:14:25.437 --> 00:14:30.027
It was not Marie Antoinette; Jeanne had sent her lover out into the streets of

00:14:30.027 --> 00:14:35.457
Paris to find a convincing lookalike, and he had found a prostitute who bore a

00:14:35.477 --> 00:14:41.237
striking resemblance to Marie Antointte and paid her to dress up as the French queen.

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:46.861
In any case, the plan worked, the cardinal was sure his love

00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:51.011
was not unrequited; that the French queen loved him back.

00:14:52.631 --> 00:14:57.001
And then something happened that gave Jeanne an opportunity she had not been expecting.

00:14:58.291 --> 00:15:03.051
While at a dinner party one evening, she heard talk of the two French

00:15:03.062 --> 00:15:07.271
jewellers who were still unable to sell this elaborate diamond necklace.

00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:13.391
We are at the start of 1785 here, 13 years after the necklace

00:15:13.391 --> 00:15:16.811
was first commissioned, and still, nobody has bought it.

00:15:17.941 --> 00:15:22.801
Jeanne has told everyone that she is close to Marie Antoinette, so she is asked

00:15:22.801 --> 00:15:28.221
whether she thinks she can persuade Marie Antoinette to finally buy the necklace.

00:15:29.401 --> 00:15:31.791
And a plan pops into Jeanne’s head.

00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:37.471
She tells the Cardinal that she has spoken to Marie Antoinette about the necklace.

00:15:37.991 --> 00:15:44.181
The queen would like to buy it, but she doesn't want it to be publicly known that she is the buyer.

00:15:45.291 --> 00:15:50.531
Marie Antoinette was already viewed as an ostentatious free-spending foreigner,

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:55.171
and if word got out that she had bought the most expensive necklace in

00:15:55.181 --> 00:16:00.901
history, well this would not be good for her already unfavourable public image.

00:16:02.041 --> 00:16:03.891
But, there was a solution.

00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:10.821
Jeanne told the cardinal that he would be doing Marie Antoinette the most monumentous favour by

00:16:10.821 --> 00:16:16.381
acting as a go-between, ordering the necklace from the jewellers and then delivering it to her.

00:16:17.911 --> 00:16:21.651
This way the queen would get the necklace without anyone ever knowing,

00:16:22.291 --> 00:16:27.121
and if he did this, Marie Antoinette would be forever in his debt.

00:16:28.561 --> 00:16:31.541
It was an offer the cardinal could not refuse.

00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:37.181
This was his chance, finally, to win back the queen, perhaps even make

00:16:37.181 --> 00:16:41.511
her his lover, and secure the political power he had so longed for.

00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:47.321
He wrote to the jewellers, and offered to buy the necklace on behalf of the queen.

00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:52.541
She would pay in instalments, he said, and he showed the jewellers the

00:16:52.541 --> 00:16:56.721
queen’s letters to him to prove to them that this was a genuine request

00:16:57.011 --> 00:17:01.541
and that he was good for the money, or rather she was good for the money.

00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:05.511
The jewellers saw the letters, and accepted.

00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:10.521
He was a high-ranking cardinal, and Marie Antoinette was queen of France.

00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:12.741
Of course they would be good for it.

00:17:13.961 --> 00:17:18.051
The jewellers handed over the necklace, no doubt rubbing their hands

00:17:18.061 --> 00:17:21.680
in anticipation of a payday they had been waiting 13 years for.

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.337
The cardinal hurried to Jeanne’s house.

00:17:25.717 --> 00:17:29.017
There was a knock on the door, and a man who the cardinal believed

00:17:29.017 --> 00:17:32.687
was the queen’s valet came to take possession of the necklace.

00:17:33.857 --> 00:17:35.567
The deed had been done.

00:17:37.277 --> 00:17:41.427
A few weeks went by, but the cardinal was surprised to never see the

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:45.457
queen wearing the necklace, even behind the closed doors of Versailles.

00:17:46.817 --> 00:17:52.407
Also, there was no sign of this long awaited acceptance into her inner circle.

00:17:52.607 --> 00:17:54.767
She was as cold as ever towards him.

00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:58.567
Of course, the necklace never got to the queen.

00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:02.667
It was broken up and the individual diamonds were sold on the

00:18:02.677 --> 00:18:06.147
black markets of Paris and London, never to be seen again.

00:18:07.497 --> 00:18:12.087
When it came to the due date of the first instalment, the first payment for the necklace,

00:18:12.497 --> 00:18:17.537
the jewellers received nothing, neither from the cardinal nor from Marie Antoinette.

00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:24.347
Days went by, and not wishing to embarrass Marie Antoinette publicly, given

00:18:24.347 --> 00:18:29.207
the discreet nature of the purchase, they first wrote to the queen, politely

00:18:29.207 --> 00:18:33.577
reminding her that she had an overdue balance of some €15 million Euros.

00:18:34.777 --> 00:18:40.287
Marie Antoinette, of course, had no idea what the letter was about, and did the

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:45.457
18th century equivalent of marking it as spam, throwing it into the fireplace.

00:18:46.977 --> 00:18:51.337
Several more days go by, and with no response to their letter, the

00:18:51.337 --> 00:18:55.627
jewellers turn up at Versailles and ask Marie Antoinette directly.

00:18:56.607 --> 00:19:02.017
She says she has no idea what they are talking about, and they promptly bring out a letter signed

00:19:02.017 --> 00:19:08.537
by her,  Marie Antoinette de France, Marie Antoinette of France, agreeing to buy the necklace.

00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:15.807
Marie Antoinette looks at the letter and scoffs; it’s clearly a fake, as a real

00:19:15.807 --> 00:19:21.377
queen would never sign “de France”–of France–it’s obvious where she is from.

00:19:21.737 --> 00:19:24.547
This is clearly the mark of a fraudster.

00:19:25.927 --> 00:19:30.527
The penny then drops, and the jewellers realise that they have been tricked.

00:19:31.177 --> 00:19:37.197
The cardinal is dragged to Versailles, and is publicly arrested in Versailles Hall of Mirrors.

00:19:38.057 --> 00:19:41.307
He is believed to be an active participant in the fraud.

00:19:41.807 --> 00:19:46.047
He for one should know that a king or queen never signs their name

00:19:46.307 --> 00:19:50.167
“de France”, so he should have spotted the forgery a mile off.

00:19:51.007 --> 00:19:51.557
He didn’t.

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:56.337
He was taken away to the Bastille, the famous prison in central Paris.

00:19:57.627 --> 00:20:00.987
It didn’t take the authorities long to track down Jeanne, her

00:20:00.987 --> 00:20:04.517
lover and husband, who were all presumed to be accomplices.

00:20:05.097 --> 00:20:09.337
There was a huge public trial, with people cramming to get into the courtroom.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:16.217
Despite the fact that Marie Antoinette was almost certainly an innocent victim of this fraud,

00:20:16.577 --> 00:20:22.317
she was so loathed by much of the French public that people simply didn’t believe her innocence.

00:20:23.377 --> 00:20:29.167
Journalists wrote that she must have been involved, such was her love of luxury, or that

00:20:29.177 --> 00:20:35.187
this was part of her plot to dupe a naive and gullible enemy, in the form of the cardinal.

00:20:36.557 --> 00:20:42.617
It did huge damage to her already battered public image, and according to some at

00:20:42.617 --> 00:20:47.417
least, was even the straw that broke the camel’s back in the French revolution.

00:20:48.737 --> 00:20:53.807
As to Jeanne, she was sentenced not only to life imprisonment, but first to be

00:20:53.817 --> 00:21:00.067
publicly whipped and branded, burned with a “v” for “voleuse”, thief in French.

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:05.007
She didn’t spend long behind bars though, as she managed to escape

00:21:05.197 --> 00:21:09.327
disguised as a boy, fleeing to London, where she wrote her memoirs.

00:21:11.017 --> 00:21:16.017
Unfortunately, Jeanne did not live a long and happy life, and it seems that the

00:21:16.027 --> 00:21:20.157
money from the sale of the diamonds ran out more quickly than she had hoped.

00:21:21.417 --> 00:21:28.357
In 1791, six years after the fraud, and aged just 35, she tried to escape from debt

00:21:28.357 --> 00:21:34.057
collectors and fell out of a hotel window, suffering what sounds like a pretty horrific death.

00:21:35.417 --> 00:21:40.227
She never managed to achieve the wealth or noble titles that she felt she was entitled

00:21:40.227 --> 00:21:47.327
to, and ironically she played a not insignificant role in the French revolution and

00:21:47.587 --> 00:21:52.357
the destruction of the aristocratic system that she had so longed to be a part of.

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:59.397
OK then, that is it for today's episode on The Affair Of The Diamond Necklace.

00:21:59.807 --> 00:22:04.007

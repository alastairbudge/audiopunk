Hello, hello hello, and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds, by Leonardo English.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.889
The show where you can listen to fascinating stories, and learn weird and

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:20.759
wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your English.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.869
I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.619
about the amazing life, and work, of George Orwell.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.499
You probably know him as the author of Animal Farm and 1984.

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.509
But, although these are the two books that he is most famous for, they

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.869
only formed a very small part of his fantastically interesting life.

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:49.629
So, in this episode you’ll learn about who he really was, what motivated him,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.159
how he thought about writing, and how he became one of the most important, if not

00:00:55.169 --> 00:01:00.639
the most important people to have ever picked up a pen and written in English.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.509
Before we get right into today’s episode, I want to remind you that you can become

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.779

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.769
Our community now has members from over 50 countries, and it's my mission to make

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:45.749
it the most interesting place for curious minds like you to improve their English.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.379
So, if that is of interest, - and I can't see a reason why it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:54.409
wouldn't be - then the place to go to is leonardoenglish.com.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.229
Ok then, George Orwell.

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:04.209
Now is the right time for you to be learning about this great man for three reasons.

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:09.539
Firstly, he lived such an interesting, varied, curious life,

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.639
that it’s always the right time to learn about George Orwell.

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:20.449
Secondly, because he is probably best remembered for his criticisms of totalitarianism, and the past

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:27.249
decade has seen a rise in exactly the sort of authoritarian regimes that Orwell warned us against.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:33.759
Thirdly, because he is an absolute master of the English language, and there is a

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:39.879
huge amount that anyone, native and non-native English speaker, can learn from him.

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.429
And I said there were three reasons, but actually there are four, a bonus one, if you are Spanish.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:51.979
And that’s because Orwell spent some of his formative years fighting in

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.749
the Spanish Civil War, so part of our story will take place in Spain.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.349
But first, let’s begin our story in London.

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:06.079
If you stand outside the offices of the British Broadcasting Corporation – better

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:13.799
known as the BBC – in London, you will see the statue of a tall, messy, unheroic

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.859
man who has clearly not spent much time or money worrying about his clothes.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.169
Cigarette in hand, he is leaning forward as if to address you.

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:33.289
Behind him, engraved into the stone, written into the stone, is one of his most famous sayings: “If

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:39.829
liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.“

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.819
Underneath his feet, carved into the stone below, is his name - George Orwell.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.649
George Orwell worked at the BBC for only two years, during the Second World War.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.716
Strangely enough, he worked in the Propaganda department in Room 101.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.829
He didn’t like it much and was quite glad to leave.

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:05.319
In fact, he was positively uncomplimentary about the BBC.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:12.509
He commented later that perhaps his presence meant that he kept the propaganda “slightly less

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:18.079
disgusting than it might otherwise have been” and that he felt he was “just an orange that was

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:24.755
being trod on by a very dirty boot”, an orange that was being stepped on by a very dirty shoe.

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:29.915
These comments show two of Orwell‘s most important traits

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:34.265
or characteristics: honesty and a genius with language.

00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:42.105
Instead of being full of compliments about the BBC, a national treasure, he was honest, and true.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:49.545
And in terms of the language, the image of an orange being stepped on by a very dirty

00:04:49.565 --> 00:04:55.865
boot is so vivid that you immediately imagine it and understand what Orwell means.

00:04:56.915 --> 00:05:03.368
In spite of his rudeness about the BBC, when it moved to new offices in 2016

00:05:03.395 --> 00:05:09.135
and wanted to have a statue of someone who would represent the core values

00:05:09.215 --> 00:05:15.345
of the organisation – which are impartiality, honesty, integrity and public

00:05:15.345 --> 00:05:21.515
service – there was no real contest as to whose statue should stand for those values.

00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:26.285
The London-based newspaper, The Financial Times, spoke for many

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:31.235
newspapers, both in the UK and elsewhere, when it said that Orwell is

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:36.465
“the true patron saint of our profession”, the patron saint of journalism.

00:05:37.325 --> 00:05:42.115
A further compliment given to Orwell is that he is one of the very few

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:47.455
writers in the world whose name has provided an adjective that has its own

00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:53.162
meaning: “  Orwellian“ is used to describe something particularly sinister and

00:05:53.162 --> 00:05:59.902
nasty, especially when it is destructive of the welfare of a free and open society.

00:06:00.642 --> 00:06:06.492
As we will see later, this adjective and references to Orwell’s most famous books, Animal

00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:13.912
Farm and 1984, are used, both by people aiming to defend freedoms and also, cynically,

00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:19.642
by those with authoritarian tendencies who are seeking to limit others‘ freedoms.

00:06:20.442 --> 00:06:25.342
It's interesting that one of the other small group of writers whose name is

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:31.742
used as an adjective is Franz Kafka; the word Kafkaesque is used to describe

00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:38.258
situations where bureaucracy and officialdom are so deliberately complex that

00:06:38.268 --> 00:06:42.688
they frustrate and anger the very people that they should be trying to help.

00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:49.208
In the same way that George Orwell’s name has developed a broader meaning, his two most famous

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:55.908
books, 1984 and Animal Farm, have established themselves in the imaginations and language of people

00:06:55.928 --> 00:07:02.958
around the world to such an extent that many people who have never read the books use the language

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:10.209
and ideas of the books unknowingly, so completely have their ideas soaked into their culture.

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:16.749
Born in 1903, George Orwell had a privileged, but difficult, start to his life.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.439
He was British, but born in India, which was still a British colony at the time.

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:27.789
His family was upper middle class, they were at the top of society

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:33.199
socially, but weren’t rich compared to others of a similar social class.

00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:37.539
Orwell won a scholarship to an English boarding school.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.539
And although he didn’t know that his parents were paying reduced fees,

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:46.109
that they were paying less money for his education than the other

00:07:46.109 --> 00:07:51.459
parents, he felt out of place, he felt poor compared to his classmates.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:57.719
He was a gifted student, and won a scholarship to Britain‘s most famous private

00:07:57.719 --> 00:08:02.949
school, Eton, where he would have received one of the best educations in the country.

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:09.809
He decided not to go to university but went out to India in order to work for the

00:08:09.999 --> 00:08:15.969
British Civil Service as part of the imperial police in Burma, in modern day Myanmar.

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:23.289
This experience, seeing the injustices and institutional cruelty of the British

00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:28.399
Empire close up, was highly formative for the young, impressionable man.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:35.269
It generated two of his most powerful essays – The Hanging and Shooting an Elephant.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:41.109
These short works are written with his characteristic clarity and vividness of English.

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:44.249
As you can imagine, I would definitely recommend you

00:08:44.249 --> 00:08:47.489
to read them - they are excellent, and very accessible.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:54.189
Although Orwell had come from an upper class and well educated background, he didn’t feel that

00:08:54.189 --> 00:09:01.499
this was real, he didn’t feel that his life thus far was how normal people lived in the real world.

00:09:02.009 --> 00:09:05.269
For the majority of his early life, he wouldn’t really have

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.909
come into contact with anyone from a lower social class.

00:09:09.449 --> 00:09:14.999
Because he wanted to find out more about how ordinary people lived, he went and lived and

00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:21.519
worked amongst some of the poorest people in society – initially in Paris and then in London.

00:09:22.029 --> 00:09:25.939
He chronicled these adventures in the first full-length book

00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:31.018
that he published, Down and Out in Paris and London, in 1933.

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:34.949
A “Down and Out” is someone who doesn’t have any money,

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:38.749
but you can also be “down and out”, meaning without money.

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:42.919
So, Down and out is both a noun and an adjective.

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:47.749
Some of the descriptions in these books are so colourful, they are

00:09:47.749 --> 00:09:52.439
so vivid and powerful that you need a strong stomach to read them.

00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:57.959
In particular, I recommend the famous description in Down and Out in Paris

00:09:57.969 --> 00:10:03.819
and London of how a French chef and waiter treat an expensive steak that

00:10:03.819 --> 00:10:08.609
is about to be served in a high-end, very expensive Parisian restaurant.

00:10:09.479 --> 00:10:14.079
It ends with the sentence, “Roughly speaking, the more one pays for

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:19.459
food, the more sweat and spittle one is obliged to eat with it.”

00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:24.779
If you like to eat steak and sometimes eat in an expensive restaurant, I

00:10:24.779 --> 00:10:28.399
promise that you will never look at a steak in quite the same way again.

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:33.459
At this point in his life, he was still a struggling author, with

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:37.249
not much published and little income, he wasn't making much money.

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:43.549
It was the next major event in his life that was to mark him forever as a political writer.

00:10:44.099 --> 00:10:49.739
From early in the 1920s it was clear that fascism was on the rise in Europe,

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:55.489
with Mussolini‘s takeover of power in Italy, and the rise of Nazism in Germany.

00:10:56.509 --> 00:11:03.319
For young, idealistic people like Orwell, there was a clear choice between fascism and communism.

00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:09.189
For those who described themselves as in the political centre or on the

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:14.549
liberal side, communism was the only viable way of opposing fascism.

00:11:15.359 --> 00:11:20.789
The Spanish Civil War, which broke out in 1936, became like an

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:26.119
international crusade for left-leaning writers and thinkers of the time.

00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:32.559
Orwell, like his fellow writer, the American Ernest Hemingway, headed south to join

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:38.079
the anti-Franco forces, the Republicans, in their fight against Franco‘s fascists.

00:11:38.969 --> 00:11:44.059
It was not just his experience fighting at the front and being wounded with a bullet

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:49.929
through his neck that influenced him so greatly, but it was perhaps above all his experience

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:55.699
seeing the in-fighting that occurred in Barcelona that affected his subsequent world view.

00:11:56.409 --> 00:12:02.259
What he witnessed was a bitter and bloody fight on the streets of Barcelona between the group that

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:08.169
he was part of, which had been formed out of Spanish working-class people and was known as the

00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:14.839
Militia, and the Soviet-backed communists; they were backed by the Communist USSR and were acting

00:12:14.849 --> 00:12:21.799
on Moscow‘s orders to destroy any other leftist groups - and certainly not campaign for democracy.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:29.979
Orwell, together with his recently married wife Eileen, therefore had to

00:12:29.979 --> 00:12:32.319
flee Spain, they had to run away from Spain, because his life was under

00:12:32.349 --> 00:12:36.949
threat from people he thought were on the same side, the Communists.

00:12:37.619 --> 00:12:41.199
He wrote later that since his experience in the Spanish Civil War,

00:12:41.719 --> 00:12:46.419
everything he had written afterwards had been “against totalitarianism”.

00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:54.399
It is in this traumatic experience that the seeds of his most famous and influential books lie.

00:12:55.129 --> 00:13:03.129
Animal Farm, a brilliant fable or parable, was written in 1944 when the Western Allies,

00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:10.389
notably the USA and Britain, were in an unlikely alliance with the USSR against the

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:17.389
Nazis; it was therefore vital not to offend the USSR’s brutal leader, Joseph Stalin.

00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:23.149
Orwell dramatised the rise of totalitarianism in the Russian state through the

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:29.119
brilliant device of showing animals taking over power from humans on a farm.

00:13:30.019 --> 00:13:35.439
Most significantly, the pigs abandon their early idealism and ideas

00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:40.219
of equality; they re-shape the truth of their political movement and

00:13:40.249 --> 00:13:45.069
eliminate their opponents in order to keep absolute power to themselves.

00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:49.949
You might remember the quote from Animal Farm where the pigs declare that

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:55.189
“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others”.

00:13:55.869 --> 00:14:00.379
Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the delicacy and importance of the

00:14:00.389 --> 00:14:04.979
political situation, Orwell had difficulty getting his book published.

00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:10.329
It was, after all, telling an uncomfortable truth about the USSR, just

00:14:10.469 --> 00:14:14.629
at a time when that uncomfortable truth was inconvenient to Britain.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:21.909
When Animal Farm was finally published in 1945, the Cold War [as the struggle

00:14:21.909 --> 00:14:26.219
between the West and the USSR came to be known] was becoming a reality.

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:31.569
The book, a clear critique of Soviet totalitarianism, quickly became a

00:14:31.609 --> 00:14:37.319
bestseller, and it has remained as relevant now as it was 76 years ago.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:42.509
Further personal tragedy struck Orwell at this stage in his life when,

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:47.999
shortly after he and his wife Eileen had adopted a baby son, Eileen died.

00:14:49.219 --> 00:14:52.959
His natural instinct always was to go to the heart of

00:14:52.969 --> 00:14:55.929
things - to go where world events were being shaped.

00:14:56.569 --> 00:15:03.069
It was this reporter‘s instinct which had taken him to Spain in 1936 and also, against all of

00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:09.623
the advice, to live in central London when the Blitz – or German bombing – was at its height.

00:15:10.439 --> 00:15:16.719
Now, in 1945 he went to witness the events unfolding as the Nazi regime

00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:22.079
fell, and he saw the awful destruction and misery of a ruined Germany.

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:27.309
The final phase in his life had Scotland as its backdrop.

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:31.769
Orwell had developed tuberculosis – or T.B.

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:36.669
as it was then known – and it was starting to reach a life-threatening stage.

00:15:37.229 --> 00:15:44.419
He knew he was dying but he had a book inside him that he knew he had to write before he died.

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:52.959
Therefore in 1947 he moved to a desolate, barely inhabited island off the West coast of

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:58.209
Scotland called Jura, which he had bought with the money he had made from Animal Farm.

00:15:59.239 --> 00:16:02.629
There, with a housekeeper and his little son, Richard,

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.889
he set out to write his most famous book, 1984.

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:12.169
Much of it was written from his bed as he was incapacitated by his

00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:16.539
illness, as he was unable to move, given how much he was suffering.

00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:23.809
1984 is an incredibly powerful book as it is, but when you realise that

00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:29.059
there was this man lying in bed, knowing he was dying and needing to get

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:34.099
this final book written, it takes on an entirely new type of meaning.

00:16:34.939 --> 00:16:39.789
How can one possibly sum up the impact of this powerful work of literature?

00:16:40.369 --> 00:16:43.239
Well, some facts are a helpful start.

00:16:43.849 --> 00:16:48.599
1984 is one of the highest selling political fiction books of all time.

00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:55.349
Its popularity was strong from the start after its publication in 1949; after

00:16:55.349 --> 00:17:00.579
all, it provided a timely warning about what was evident in the world then.

00:17:01.239 --> 00:17:07.879
The USSR‘s ruthless occupation of Eastern Europe was under way and nuclear armaments

00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:13.029
had added an additional, apocalyptic element to the possibility of another war.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:19.689
Fast forward to the last 20 years or so, as complacency about the strength

00:17:19.809 --> 00:17:24.489
of Western-style style democracy has been shaken by the rise of populism and

00:17:24.509 --> 00:17:31.029
autocratic regimes, 1984‘s relevance to our own times has become yet more clear.

00:17:31.799 --> 00:17:38.849
There have been dramatic spikes, sharp increases, in sales of the book after troubling world events,

00:17:38.939 --> 00:17:46.509
such as the bombing of the Twin Towers in New York in 2001 and the Wikileaks scandal in 2013.

00:17:47.659 --> 00:17:53.829
Most recently the Trump presidency, with its deliberate spread of misinformation

00:17:53.849 --> 00:17:59.349
and the attack on mainstream media as “fake news” has led many new readers

00:17:59.349 --> 00:18:05.089
to 1984, and for it to be continued to be quoted as a point of reference.

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:11.379
You may well remember the controversy on the day after President Trump‘s inauguration in

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:18.249
January 2017; when his advisor, Kellyane Conway, used the expression “alternative facts”.

00:18:19.223 --> 00:18:25.613
In January of 2021 the storming of the Washington Capitol building caused another

00:18:25.623 --> 00:18:31.183
increase, pushing the novel once again to the top of the Amazon bestseller list.

00:18:31.893 --> 00:18:36.883
I mentioned earlier that 1984 has also been used by the opponents of free

00:18:36.883 --> 00:18:42.303
speech, by exactly the kind of people that Orwell was criticising in 1984.

00:18:43.303 --> 00:18:49.453
Firstly, during the American 2016 presidential campaign there was a meme, an

00:18:49.683 --> 00:18:54.023
image shared around the Internet, with the words “The People Will Believe What

00:18:54.053 --> 00:18:58.763
the Media Tells Them They Believe”, and these were attributed to George Orwell.

00:18:59.323 --> 00:19:06.523
This meme was shared tens of thousands of times, and seen by tens if not hundreds of millions of

00:19:06.523 --> 00:19:13.113
people, who shared it to express the idea that the mainstream media is out to trick the people.

00:19:14.163 --> 00:19:17.883
But George Orwell never said or wrote this.

00:19:18.183 --> 00:19:22.166
The entire thing was created by a Russian troll farm – i.e.

00:19:22.353 --> 00:19:27.133
an organisation designed to send out misinformation on social media.

00:19:27.793 --> 00:19:31.023
There is something frighteningly Orwellian about such

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:34.623
cynical misinformation and nasty use of his name.

00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:38.783
As Timothy Snyder, the Professor of History at Yale

00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:42.563
University wrote: “To understand Putin, read Orwell.“

00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:51.043
My second example is less sophisticated perhaps, but shows how 1984 is used by almost anyone,

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:56.213
including people who may well have never read the book, to try to put forward their point.

00:19:56.883 --> 00:20:02.393
Shortly after Trump was banned from the social media platform, Twitter, in January

00:20:02.393 --> 00:20:09.383
of 2021, his son, Donald Trump Junior tweeted: “We are living in Orwell‘s 1984.

00:20:09.653 --> 00:20:12.103
Free-speech no longer exists in America…”

00:20:13.043 --> 00:20:17.363
Now, this is not a comment on whether it was right or wrong to remove Trump

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:22.443
from social media networks, but rather a comment on the fact that Donald Junior

00:20:22.513 --> 00:20:27.403
is complaining about the fact that his father doesn’t have a way to spread

00:20:27.513 --> 00:20:33.153
alternative facts, and likening the modern world to the one in Orwell’s cult novel.

00:20:33.873 --> 00:20:37.273
I think that you will have now understood the ability that Orwell

00:20:37.293 --> 00:20:41.573
still has to reach into the minds of the powerful and the influential.

00:20:42.803 --> 00:20:48.613
He is a common reference point and has become one of the most fruitful sources of powerful,

00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:54.433
easily understood metaphors or images for the worst tendencies of the modern world.

00:20:55.183 --> 00:20:56.143
“Don’t let it happen.

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:59.383
It depends on you,” is one of his final thoughts.

00:21:00.443 --> 00:21:03.823
But there are also plenty of other reasons for reading his work.

00:21:04.343 --> 00:21:09.143
Mainly, he is just a fantastic writer, and a master of the English language.

00:21:09.773 --> 00:21:14.553
There is an entire episode on this, episode 38, to be precise, where you can

00:21:14.553 --> 00:21:19.613
learn about his 5 Rules for Effective Writing, so I’d advise you to listen to

00:21:19.623 --> 00:21:23.353
that one for a detailed explanation on Orwell’s thoughts about how to write.

00:21:23.353 --> 00:21:23.977
Let's start with a couple of examples.

00:21:26.879 --> 00:21:32.849
The most important point for me is about how one should always use simple language, when possible.

00:21:33.749 --> 00:21:39.079
Orwell says “Political language…..is designed to make lies sound truthful

00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:45.969
and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.”

00:21:46.759 --> 00:21:52.049
He hated seeing people use overly complicated language as a way of twisting

00:21:52.169 --> 00:21:57.469
a message, and was always a great supporter of simple, clear, simple words.

00:21:58.109 --> 00:22:03.299
I’m always reminded of Orwell whenever I see terrible videos on social

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:08.089
media, on Instagram and things, of English teachers saying things like

00:22:08.259 --> 00:22:14.139
“Don’t say go up, say elevate”, or "don't say people, say inhabitants".

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:19.959
It’s just complete rubbish, if you follow this sort of advice you’ll end up talking

00:22:19.959 --> 00:22:25.699
like a robotic dictionary, and Orwell would be turning in his grave if he could see it.

00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:27.409
So, don’t do it.

00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:34.649
Finally, I’ll leave you with three curiosities about the great man, three weird facts.

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:39.729
Firstly, as you may know, George Orwell wasn’t his real name.

00:22:40.019 --> 00:22:43.029
He was born with the name Eric Blair.

00:22:43.709 --> 00:22:45.559
George Orwell was his pen name.

00:22:46.059 --> 00:22:48.959
He took inspiration from the name of the king for the first

00:22:49.169 --> 00:22:52.773
name and from the name of a local river for his second.

00:22:53.619 --> 00:22:57.979
Secondly, the script of Animal Farm was very nearly

00:22:57.989 --> 00:23:02.459
lost when Orwell‘s house was destroyed by a German bomb.

00:23:02.939 --> 00:23:06.599
The anxious author had to dig in the rubble, to dig

00:23:06.699 --> 00:23:09.729
through the fallen bricks, in order to retrieve it.

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:16.849
And finally, as Orwell approached death with tuberculosis he asked three different

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:22.359
young women to marry him, wanting companionship and saying that they had an excellent

00:23:22.389 --> 00:23:27.969
chance of shortly becoming rich widows on the proceeds of his highly successful books.

00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:31.455
The third one, Sonia Bronwell, accepted him.

00:23:32.085 --> 00:23:35.945
He is said to have worn a lilac-coloured smoking jacket as

00:23:35.945 --> 00:23:38.975
he lay in the bed where he would die three months later.

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:44.605
Orwell was a man of huge talent, and who knows what

00:23:44.615 --> 00:23:47.325
he might have given us had he lived a longer life.

00:23:47.914 --> 00:23:54.044
His writing is timeless, it is as appropriate now as it was in 1948, and I’m

00:23:54.044 --> 00:23:57.794
sure that people will still be talking about Orwell in hundreds of years time.

00:23:58.304 --> 00:24:03.624
Like any great writer, the themes that Orwell chooses are universal.

00:24:04.264 --> 00:24:08.174
We learn through universal human truths, through ideas

00:24:08.284 --> 00:24:11.334
and subjects that every single person can relate to.

00:24:11.814 --> 00:24:18.144
Joy, food, love, desire, humour, language, and of course, animals.

00:24:18.844 --> 00:24:22.884
I’ll just leave you with one of my favourite thought-provoking quotes from

00:24:22.894 --> 00:24:27.174
Nineteen Eighty Four, which comes from the evil character, Big Brother.

00:24:28.224 --> 00:24:32.404
And that’s “Who controls the past controls the future.

00:24:33.274 --> 00:24:36.444
Who controls the present controls the past.”

00:24:38.574 --> 00:24:44.854
OK then, that is it for today's episode on George Orwell, or should I say, Eric Blair.

00:24:45.564 --> 00:24:49.624
I hope it's been an interesting one, that you've learnt something new, and that

00:24:49.624 --> 00:24:54.624
the next time someone says that a situation is Orwellian or makes a reference

00:24:54.624 --> 00:24:59.254
to Animal Farm, well, you’ll know a little bit more about the man behind it all.

00:24:59.844 --> 00:25:03.384
